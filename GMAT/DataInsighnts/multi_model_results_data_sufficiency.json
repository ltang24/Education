                    "model_response": "To determine the units digit of the product ( P \\times Q ), where ( P ) and ( Q ) are prime numbers less than 70, let's analyze the statements.\n\n**Statement (1)**: The units digit of ( P^{(4k+2)} - Q ) is equal to 7. \n\nFor any prime ( P ), the units digit of ( P^{(4k+2)} ) will depend on the units digit of ( P ). The possible units digits for primes are 1, 3, 7, and 9. \n\n- If ( P ) has a units digit of 1, ( P^{(4k+2)} ) will also have a units digit of 1.\n- If ( P ) has a units digit of 3, ( P^{(4k+2)} ) will have a units digit of 9.\n- If ( P ) has a units digit of 7, ( P^{(4k+2)} ) will have a units digit of 9.\n- If ( P ) has a units digit of 9, ( P^{(4k+2)} ) will have a units digit of 1.\n\nGiven that ( P^{(4k+2)} - Q ) has a units digit of 7, we can analyze the possible values of ( Q ):\n\n- If ( P^{(4k+2)} ) has a units digit of 1, then ( Q ) must have a units digit of 4.\n- If ( P^{(4k+2)} ) has a units digit of 9, then ( Q ) must have a units digit of 2.\n\nHowever, since ( Q ) is a prime number, the only valid units digits for ( Q ) are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The only viable option from the above deductions is ( Q ) having a units digit of 2, which implies ( P ) must have a units digit of 9.\n\nThus, ( P ) could be 19, 29, 59, or 67, and ( Q ) must be 2. Therefore, the units digit of ( P \\times Q ) is ( 9 \\times 2 = 18 ), which has a units digit of 8.\n\n**Statement (2)**: The units digit of the expression ( PQ + Q \\times (Q + 1) - Q^2 ) is a perfect cube.\n\nThe expression simplifies to ( PQ + Q^2 + Q - Q^2 = PQ + Q ). The units digit of ( PQ + Q ) will depend on the units digits of ( P ) and ( Q ).\n\nIf ( Q = 2 ) (which we established as a possibility), then the units digit of ( PQ + 2 ) will depend on the units digit of ( P ). If ( P ) has a units digit of 9, then ( PQ + 2 ) will have a units digit of ( 8 + 2 = 0 ), which is a perfect cube (since ( 0^3 = 0 )).\n\nHowever, if ( Q ) takes on other values, we would need to check if the resulting units digit is a perfect cube. This statement alone does not uniquely determine the units digit of ( P \\times Q ).\n\nCombining both statements, we conclude that while Statement (1) gives us a definitive units digit of 8 for ( P \\times Q ), Statement (2) does not provide additional unique information.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

We don't have the individual prices of oranges and apples, so we need to analyze the statements to see if they can help us determine the total price.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1):** The price of 39 oranges and 36 apples is $111.\n\nLet:\n- ( p ) = price of one orange\n- ( q ) = price of one apple\n\nFrom statement (1), we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 39p + 36q = 111 \\]\n\nWe want to find the price of 13 oranges and 12 apples:\n\\[ 13p + 12q \\]\n\nTo see if we can derive ( 13p + 12q ) from ( 39p + 36q ), we can factor out the coefficients:\n\\[ 39p + 36q = 3(13p + 12q) \\]\n\nThus, we can express ( 13p + 12q ) as:\n\\[ 13p + 12q = \\frac{111}{3} = 37 \\]\n\nSo, statement (1) is sufficient to determine the price of 13 oranges and 12 apples.\n\n**Statement (2):** The price of 3 oranges and 2 apples is $7.\n\nUsing the same variables:\nFrom statement (2), we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 3p + 2q = 7 \\]\n\nAgain, we want to find ( 13p + 12q ). To do this, we can manipulate the equation. We can multiply the equation by a factor that will help us align it with ( 13p + 12q ). \n\nIf we multiply statement (2) by 4:\n\\[ 12p + 8q = 28 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find a way to get to ( 13p + 12q ). We can add another equation to this, but we don't have enough information to isolate ( p ) and ( q ) directly from this statement alone. Thus, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\n- Statement (1) is sufficient.\n- Statement (2) is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\nSince statement (1) alone is sufficient to answer the question, while statement (2) is not, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

This means we need to determine if:\n- P(Red) = P(Blue)\n- P(Red) ≠ P(Green)\n\nGiven that there is at least one ball of each color (red, green, blue), we can denote:\n- r = number of red balls\n- g = number of green balls\n- b = number of blue balls\n\nThe total number of balls is ( r + g + b ).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1): There are 5 balls in the box.**\nThis gives us the equation:\n\\[ r + g + b = 5 \\]\nHowever, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the numbers of red, green, and blue balls. For example, we could have:\n- 1 red, 1 green, 3 blue (P(Red) = 1/5, P(Blue) = 3/5, P(Green) = 1/5)\n- 2 red, 2 green, 1 blue (P(Red) = 2/5, P(Blue) = 1/5, P(Green) = 2/5)\n\nIn both cases, we see that the probabilities can either be equal or not equal based on the distribution of the balls. Therefore, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2): The number of green balls is greater than the number of blue balls.**\nThis tells us:\n\\[ g > b \\]\nHowever, without knowing the total number of balls or the number of red balls, we cannot determine the probabilities. For instance:\n- If ( g = 2 ) and ( b = 1 ), we could have ( r = 1 ) (P(Red) = 1/4, P(Blue) = 1/4, P(Green) = 2/4) which satisfies the condition.\n- If ( g = 3 ) and ( b = 1 ), we could have ( r = 1 ) (P(Red) = 1/5, P(Blue) = 1/5, P(Green) = 3/5) which also satisfies the condition.\n\nThus, statement (2) alone is also not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, we need to consider them together.\n\nCombining both statements:\n- From statement (1), we know ( r + g + b = 5 ).\n- From statement (2), we know ( g > b ).\n\nLet’s analyze the possible distributions:\n1. If ( g = 3 ) and ( b = 1 ), then ( r = 1 ). This gives:\n   - P(Red) = 1/5, P(Blue) = 1/5, P(Green) = 3/5 (satisfies the condition).\n2. If ( g = 2 ) and ( b = 1 ), then ( r = 2 ). This gives:\n   - P(Red) = 2/5, P(Blue) = 1/5, P(Green) = 2/5 (does not satisfy the condition).\n\nThe combination of the two statements does not provide a unique solution to satisfy the conditions of the question.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and together they do not provide a definitive answer, the correct option is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

The dealership sells only sedans and SUVs, and on Tuesday, it sold 1/6 of the sedans in stock.\n\nLet:\n- ( S ) = number of sedans at the beginning of Tuesday\n- ( U ) = number of SUVs at the beginning of Tuesday\n- Total inventory at the beginning of Tuesday = ( S + U )\n\nThe dealership sold ( \\frac{1}{6}S ) sedans on Tuesday.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1):** By the end of the day, the dealership had sold ( \\frac{8}{9} ) as many sedans as SUVs.\n\nFrom this statement, we can set up an equation. Let ( x ) be the number of SUVs sold. Then:\n- Sedans sold = ( \\frac{1}{6}S )\n- According to the statement: ( \\frac{1}{6}S = \\frac{8}{9}x )\n\nFrom this, we can express ( x ) in terms of ( S ):\n\\[ x = \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}S = \\frac{3}{16}S \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total inventory:\n\\[ S + U = S + x = S + \\frac{3}{16}S = \\frac{19}{16}S \\]\n\nTo determine if ( S + U > 100 ):\n\\[ \\frac{19}{16}S > 100 \\]\n\\[ S > \\frac{100 \\cdot 16}{19} \\approx 84.21 \\]\n\nSince ( S ) must be a whole number, ( S ) must be at least 85. However, we don’t have enough information about ( U ) to conclude whether ( S + U > 100 ). Thus, Statement (1) alone is insufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** The dealership sold 85% as many sedans on Tuesday as it did on Wednesday.\n\nLet ( y ) be the number of sedans sold on Wednesday. Then:\n- Sedans sold on Tuesday = ( 0.85y )\n\nSince we know the dealership sold ( \\frac{1}{6}S ) sedans on Tuesday:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{6}S = 0.85y \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{6 \\cdot 0.85}S = \\frac{S}{5.1} \\]\n\nThis does not provide any direct information about the total inventory ( S + U ).

However, combining them does not yield a clear conclusion about the total inventory either.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nFinal Answer: E",

This means that when ( N ) is divided by ( n ), ( n+1 ), or ( n+2 ), the remainder is always 3. Therefore, we can express this condition mathematically as:\n- ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod n )\n- ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod (n+1) )\n- ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod (n+2) )\n\nFrom this, we can derive that ( N - 3 ) must be divisible by ( n ), ( n+1 ), and ( n+2 ).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1):** ( N ) is between 7 and 70.\n- This gives us a range for ( N ) but does not provide any specific information about ( n ) or how ( N ) relates to ( n ). Thus, we cannot determine a unique value for ( N ) based solely on this statement. \n\n**Statement (2):** ( n ) is the smallest number with exactly 3 distinct factors.\n- A number has exactly 3 distinct factors if it is the square of a prime number (since the factors will be ( 1, p, p^2 )). The smallest prime is 2, so ( n = 2^2 = 4 ). \n- If ( n = 4 ), then we can analyze the conditions:\n  - ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 ) implies ( N = 4k + 3 ) for some integer ( k ).\n  - ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 ) implies ( N = 5m + 3 ) for some integer ( m ).\n  - ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 ) implies ( N = 6p + 3 ) for some integer ( p ).\n  \n  We can find common values of ( N ) that satisfy these conditions:\n  - The values of ( N ) that satisfy ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 ) are ( 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, \\ldots )\n  - The values of ( N ) that satisfy ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 ) are ( 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58, 63, 68, 73, \\ldots )\n  - The values of ( N ) that satisfy ( N \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 ) are ( 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, \\ldots )\n\n  By examining these sequences, we find that the common values of ( N ) that fit all three conditions and are between 7 and 70 are ( 15, 27, 39, 51, 63 ).\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) alone does not provide sufficient information to determine ( N ).\n- Statement (2) alone gives us a specific value for ( n ) and allows us to derive possible values for ( N ) that fit the conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince Statement (2) alone is sufficient to determine ( N ), but Statement (1) is not, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

Therefore, the total original price of the six coats is:\n\\[ \n6 \\times 85 = 510 \n\\]\n\nAfter two coats are discounted by 20%, the average price of the six coats drops to $76.

The discount on each coat is 20%, so:\n\\[ \n0.2x + 0.2y = 54 \n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \nx + y = 270 \n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1): One of the discounted coats was the one with the highest original price.**\n\nThis statement tells us that the highest-priced coat was discounted, but it doesn’t provide any information about the lowest-priced coat. Therefore, we cannot determine if the lowest-priced coat was one of the discounted coats based solely on this statement.\n\n**Statement (2): Before the discount, none of the coats had a price greater than $180.**\n\nThis statement gives us a range for the prices of the coats. Since the highest price is capped at $180, we can analyze the implications. If the highest-priced coat is $180, then the other coat that was discounted must be priced such that their total is $270. Thus:\n\\[ \n180 + y = 270 \\implies y = 90 \n\\]\nThis means the two discounted coats are priced at $180 and $90.

The statement gives us the equation:\n\\[ a + b = \\frac{1}{5}(e + f) \\]\n\nThis statement provides a relationship between the smallest and largest numbers, but we still have multiple unknowns and no specific values for ( a, b, e, ) or ( f ). Thus, we cannot determine the greatest number from this statement alone.\n\n**Statement (2)**: The middle two numbers are 5 and 7.\n\nThis means that when the numbers are arranged, the third number is 5 and the fourth number is 7. The set can be represented as:\n\\[ a, b, 5, 7, e, f \\]\nGiven that the median is 6, this aligns with the information provided. \n\nNow, we know:\n- The sum of the numbers is 42.\n- The two middle numbers are 5 and 7, which gives us:\n\\[ a + b + 5 + 7 + e + f = 42 \\]\n\\[ a + b + e + f = 30 \\]\n\nAlso, since the mode is 7, at least two of the numbers must be 7. Therefore, we can assume ( e = 7 ) or ( f = 7 ) (or both). \n\nHowever, we still do not have enough information to determine the greatest number from this statement alone, as we do not know the values of ( a ) and ( b ).\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) does not provide enough information to determine the greatest number.\n- Statement (2) also does not provide enough information to determine the greatest number.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient to answer the question, and combining them does not yield additional information to find the greatest number, we conclude that both statements together are not sufficient.\n\nFinal Answer: E",

To determine this, we need to consider the speeds for both legs of the trip.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1):** In the morning, Chris drove at an average speed of at least 10 miles per hour while travelling from Toronto to Oakville.\n\n- This statement tells us that Chris's speed in the morning was at least 10 mph, but it doesn't provide any information about his speed in the evening. Without knowing the speed for the return trip, we cannot determine the average speed for the entire round trip. Therefore, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** In the evening, Chris drove at an average speed which was no more than 50 miles per hour while travelling from Oakville to Toronto.\n\n- This statement gives us a maximum speed for the evening trip but does not provide any information about the morning trip. Again, without knowing the speed for the morning trip, we cannot determine the average speed for the entire round trip. Thus, statement (2) alone is also not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\n\n- **Statement (1)** alone is not sufficient.\n- **Statement (2)** alone is not sufficient.\n- Together, we have:\n  - Morning speed: at least 10 mph\n  - Evening speed: at most 50 mph\n\nTo find the average speed for the round trip, we can use the formula for average speed: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\nLet’s assume the distance from Toronto to Oakville is (d). The time taken for each leg of the trip can be expressed as follows:\n\n- Time in the morning: ( \\frac{d}{v_1} ) where ( v_1 \\geq 10 )\n- Time in the evening: ( \\frac{d}{v_2} ) where ( v_2 \\leq 50 )\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is (2d), and the total time is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\frac{d}{v_1} + \\frac{d}{v_2}\n\\]\n\nThe average speed for the round trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{v_1} + \\frac{d}{v_2}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{v_1} + \\frac{1}{v_2}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the information given:\n- (v_1 \\geq 10)\n- (v_2 \\leq 50)\n\nWe can analyze the extremes:\n- If (v_1 = 10) and (v_2 = 50), the average speed would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{50}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{5 + 1}{50}} = \\frac{2 \\times 50}{6} = \\frac{100}{6} \\approx 16.67 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n- If (v_1) is higher than 10, the average speed will increase, but since (v_2) is capped at 50, it will still be less than 100 mph.\n\nThus, even when combining both statements, we cannot conclude that the average speed is less than 100 mph without knowing more about the specific values of (v_1) and (v_2). \n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient and even together they do not provide enough information to definitively answer the question, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

We know:\n- There are a total of 16 coins.\n- The total value of the coins is 288 cents.\n- The coins can be of denominations: 1-cent, 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent.\n\nLet’s denote:\n- ( x_1 ): number of 1-cent coins\n- ( x_5 ): number of 5-cent coins\n- ( x_{10} ): number of 10-cent coins\n- ( x_{25} ): number of 25-cent coins\n- ( x_{50} ): number of 50-cent coins\n\nWe have the following equations based on the problem:\n1. ( x_1 + x_5 + x_{10} + x_{25} + x_{50} = 16 ) (total number of coins)\n2. ( x_1 + 5x_5 + 10x_{10} + 25x_{25} + 50x_{50} = 288 ) (total value of coins)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1)**: The exact numbers of 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent coins among the 16 coins in the jar are, respectively, 6, 5, and 2.\n\nFrom this statement, we can assign:\n- ( x_{10} = 6 )\n- ( x_{25} = 5 )\n- ( x_{50} = 2 )\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the first equation:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_5 + 6 + 5 + 2 = 16\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_5 = 3 \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\nNext, substitute into the second equation:\n\\[\nx_1 + 5x_5 + 10(6) + 25(5) + 50(2) = 288\n\\]\nCalculating the constants:\n\\[\nx_1 + 5x_5 + 60 + 125 + 100 = 288\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx_1 + 5x_5 + 285 = 288\n\\]\nSo, we have:\n\\[\nx_1 + 5x_5 = 3 \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. ( x_1 + x_5 = 3 )\n2. ( x_1 + 5x_5 = 3 )\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express ( x_5 ) in terms of ( x_1 ):\n\\[\nx_5 = 3 - x_1\n\\]\nSubstituting into equation (2):\n\\[\nx_1 + 5(3 - x_1) = 3\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx_1 + 15 - 5x_1 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n-4x_1 + 15 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n-4x_1 = -12 \\implies x_1 = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, statement (1) gives us ( x_1 = 3 ). Thus, statement (1) is sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2)**: Among the 16 coins in the jar, there are twice as many 10-cent coins as 1-cent coins.\n\nLet’s denote ( x_1 ) as the number of 1-cent coins. Then ( x_{10} = 2x_1 ).\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_5 + 2x_1 + x_{25} + x_{50} = 16\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n3x_1 + x_5 + x_{25} + x_{50} = 16 \\quad (3)\n\\]\n\nFor the second equation:\n\\[\nx_1 + 5x_5 + 10(2x_1) + 25x_{25} + 50x_{50} = 288\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx_1 + 5x_5 + 20x_1 + 25x_{25} + 50x_{50} = 288\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\n21x_1 + 5x_5 + 25x_{25} + 50x_{50} = 288 \\quad (4)\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations (3) and (4) with four unknowns. We cannot uniquely determine ( x_1 ) from these equations alone, as we have more variables than equations. Thus, statement (2) is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) is sufficient to determine the number of 1-cent coins.\n- Statement (2) is not sufficient on its own.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude\nThe answer is that only statement (1) is sufficient.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

This ( y ) is known as the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers from 1 to ( x ).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1): ( y = 10x )**\n\nFrom this statement, we know that the least common multiple ( y ) is equal to ( 10x ). \n\nTo find ( x ), we need to consider the LCM of integers from 1 to ( x ). The LCM of the first ( x ) integers must be a multiple of ( x ). Since ( y = 10x ), we can infer that ( 10x ) must also be divisible by all integers from 1 to ( x ).\n\nHowever, we cannot directly deduce ( x ) from this equation alone without additional information about the LCM of the integers from 1 to ( x ). For example, if ( x = 5 ), then ( y = 60 ) (since LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 60) and ( y = 10x = 50 ) does not hold. If ( x = 6 ), then ( y = 60 ) (since LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 60) and ( y = 10x = 60 ) holds. \n\nThus, this statement alone does not uniquely determine ( x ).\n\n**Statement (2): ( y = 60 )**\n\nHere, we know that ( y ) is the LCM of the integers from 1 to ( x ) and that it equals 60. We need to find the largest ( x ) such that the LCM of integers from 1 to ( x ) is 60.\n\nCalculating the LCMs:\n- LCM(1) = 1\n- LCM(1, 2) = 2\n- LCM(1, 2, 3) = 6\n- LCM(1, 2, 3, 4) = 12\n- LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 60\n- LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 60\n\nThe LCM remains 60 for ( x = 5 ) and ( x = 6 ). However, since ( x ) must be greater than 1, we can conclude that ( x ) could be either 5 or 6. Therefore, this statement alone does not uniquely determine ( x ).\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\n\n- Statement (1) does not provide a unique solution for ( x ).\n- Statement (2) also does not provide a unique solution for ( x ) since both 5 and 6 yield ( y = 60 ).\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient to determine a unique value for ( x ), and together they do not provide any additional clarity, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

Thus, Statement (1) is insufficient.\n\n   **Statement (2)**: On one of the days, Jingle covered 360 miles.\n\n   - If one of the days is 360 miles, we can denote the distances covered over the three days as (d_1), (d_2), and (d_3), where one of these is 360 miles. The total distance is still 1,080 miles, so:\n     \\[\n     d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 1080\n     \\]\n   - If one of the distances is 360 miles, the other two distances must sum to (1080 - 360 = 720) miles. The median will depend on the values of the other two distances. If both distances are less than or equal to 360 miles, the median will be 360 or less, making the average greater. If one distance is greater than 360, we cannot definitively conclude the relationship between the average and the median.

The digits of ( N ) can be denoted as ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) for the hundreds, tens, and units places respectively. Thus, ( N = 100a + 10b + c ).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n#### Statement (1): The tens digit of ( N ) is 5.\n- If ( b = 5 ), then ( N ) can be expressed as ( N = 100a + 50 + c ).\n- Since ( N ) must be greater than 200, ( a ) can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n- The digits ( a ) and ( c ) must be factors of ( N ).\n- The possible values of ( N ) can be calculated for each ( a ) (from 2 to 9) and ( c ) (from 0 to 9) to check if both ( a ) and ( c ) are factors of ( N ).\n  \nHowever, without calculating specific values, we cannot determine a unique ( N ) just from this information. Thus, Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n#### Statement (2): The units digit of ( N ) is 5.\n- If ( c = 5 ), then ( N ) can be expressed as ( N = 100a + 10b + 5 ).\n- Again, ( N ) must be greater than 200, so ( a ) can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n- The digits ( a ) and ( b ) must also be factors of ( N ).\n  \nSimilar to Statement (1), we cannot determine a unique ( N ) just from this information either. Thus, Statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements.\nNow we need to consider both statements together:\n- From Statement (1), we know ( b = 5 ).\n- From Statement (2), we know ( c = 5 ).\n- Therefore, ( N ) can be expressed as ( N = 100a + 50 + 5 = 100a + 55 ).\n\nNow, we need to find a suitable ( a ) such that both ( a ) and 5 are factors of ( N ):\n- For ( a = 2 ): ( N = 255 ) (not a factor of 255)\n- For ( a = 3 ): ( N = 355 ) (not a factor of 355)\n- For ( a = 4 ): ( N = 455 ) (not a factor of 455)\n- For ( a = 5 ): ( N = 555 ) (5 is a factor, but 5 is not a factor of 555)\n- For ( a = 6 ): ( N = 655 ) (not a factor of 655)\n- For ( a = 7 ): ( N = 755 ) (not a factor of 755)\n- For ( a = 8 ): ( N = 855 ) (not a factor of 855)\n- For ( a = 9 ): ( N = 955 ) (not a factor of 955)\n\nNone of these values yield a valid ( N ) where both digits are factors of ( N ). \n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and even together they do not yield a valid ( N ), the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

Analyze the sufficiency of each statement:\n#### Statement (1): **There are 81 total members on the Dallas team.**\n\nThis statement gives us the total number of people on the team, which includes team leaders, group directors, and fundraisers. The total number of members can be represented as:\n\\[\nL + D + F\n\\]\nHowever, we are missing the relationships between these variables. Without knowing how **L**, **D**, and **F** are related to each other or any additional constraints, this statement alone does not provide enough information to determine the number of team leaders (L). \n\nSo, **Statement (1) alone is not sufficient**.\n\n#### Statement (2): **There are 5 group directors on the Dallas team.**\n\nThis statement provides us with the number of group directors (**D** = 5) on the team.

Therefore, **Statement (2) alone is not sufficient** to determine the number of team leaders.\n\n### 3. Analyze the sufficiency of combining both statements:\n#### Statement (1) + Statement (2): \nWe now know two things:\n- **Total members** = 81.\n- **Number of group directors (D)** = 5.\n\nUsing the equation for total members:\n\\[\nL + D + F = 81\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(D = 5\\) into the equation:\n\\[\nL + 5 + F = 81 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad L + F = 76\n\\]\nThis equation alone still leaves us with two unknowns: **L** and **F**.

We know that the mean number of residents in each apartment in the building is 2.3. This means that if we let the total number of apartments in the building be \\(x\\), the total number of residents in the building is \\(2.3x\\). Therefore, to find the total number of apartments \\(x\\), we need sufficient information to calculate or estimate \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n#### Statement (1): \"On each floor, the number of apartments is between 2 and 4 inclusive.\"\nThis means that on each of the 6 floors, the number of apartments could be 2, 3, or 4. Let the number of apartments on each floor be \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6\\), with \\(2 \\leq a_i \\leq 4\\) for each \\(i\\). \n- The total number of apartments in the building is \\(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6\\), but we cannot determine a precise total since the number of apartments on each floor could vary. For example:\n  - If each floor has 2 apartments, the total number of apartments is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\).\n  - If each floor has 4 apartments, the total number of apartments is \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n  - If some floors have 2 apartments and others have 4, the total number will lie somewhere between 12 and 24, but we cannot narrow it down further without additional information.\nThus, **Statement (1) alone is insufficient** to determine the exact number of apartments.\n\n#### Statement (2): \"The total number of residents in the block is greater than 40.\"\nLet the total number of apartments be \\(x\\). The total number of residents is \\(2.3x\\), and we are told that \\(2.3x > 40\\).\n- Dividing both sides of the inequality by 2.3, we get \\(x > \\frac{40}{2.3} \\approx 17.39\\). \n- Since \\(x\\) must be an integer (because the number of apartments must be an integer), we conclude that \\(x \\geq 18\\).\n- This tells us that the total number of apartments is at least 18, but it doesn't give us an exact value for \\(x\\). Thus, **Statement (2) alone is not sufficient** to determine the exact number of apartments.\n\n#### Combining Statements (1) and (2):\n- From Statement (2), we know that \\(x \\geq 18\\).\n- From Statement (1), we know that the number of apartments on each floor is between 2 and 4. Therefore, the total number of apartments \\(x\\) must be the sum of six values, each between 2 and 4. \n  - The smallest possible total number of apartments is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\).\n  - The largest possible total number of apartments is \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n- Given that \\(x \\geq 18\\) from Statement (2), the possible values of \\(x\\) are restricted to be between 18 and 24. This is a finite range of values, but it still doesn't uniquely determine \\(x\\).\nThus, **Statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient** to determine the exact number of apartments.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- **Statement (1) alone** is insufficient to determine the number of apartments, as it only provides a range of possible totals.\n- **Statement (2) alone** is also insufficient, as it only provides a lower bound on the number of apartments.\n- **Both statements together** still leave us with multiple possible values for \\(x\\) (between 18 and 24), so they are also insufficient.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct answer is **E: Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient to answer the question asked, and additional data specific to the problem are needed.**",

The question asks for the probability that both socks selected are black.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1):** The probability is less than 0.3 that the first sock selected will be black.\n\nThis statement gives us information about the first sock but does not provide any specific information about the total number of black socks. For example, if there are 1 black sock, the probability of selecting it first would be 1/6 (approximately 0.167), which is less than 0.3. If there are 2 black socks, the probability would be 2/6 (approximately 0.333), which is not less than 0.3. Thus, we cannot determine the exact number of black socks or the probability of selecting two black socks based solely on this statement.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement (1):** Not sufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Statement (2):** The probability is greater than 0.4 that both socks will be white.\n\nThis statement implies that the probability of selecting two white socks is greater than 0.4.

Since each pie contains 8 slices, we need at least:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{8} = 3.75 \\text{ pies}.\n\\]\n\nThis means that at least **4 pies** are required.

The value of ⌈x⌉ can vary within this range:\n\n- If **x = 2.6**, ⌈x⌉ = 3, which is **not enough** pies for 30 slices.\n- If **x = 5.5**, ⌈x⌉ = 6, which is **more than enough** pies.\n\nSo, statement (1) doesn't definitively answer the question because the number of pies could vary from 3 to 6 depending on the exact value of **x**. **Statement (1) alone is not sufficient**.\n\n### Statement (2): **x is a multiple of 3**\n\nThis tells us that **x** is a multiple of 3, so possible values of **x** could be **3, 6, 9, 12, ...**. But we still need to know if ⌈x⌉ pies are enough for 30 guests. Let’s analyze:\n\n- If **x = 3**, then ⌈x⌉ = 3 pies, which is **not enough** for 30 guests (since 3 pies provide only 24 slices).\n- If **x = 6**, then ⌈x⌉ = 6 pies, which is **more than enough** (since 6 pies provide 48 slices).\n\nThis means that **x = 3** (the smallest multiple of 3 that fits) does **not** work, but **x = 6** works. Therefore, **Statement (2) alone is not sufficient** because we still don't know which multiple of 3 is being used. **Statement (2) alone is not sufficient**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\n\nWe have concluded that:\n- Statement (1) alone is not sufficient because **x** can vary within a range that may lead to fewer than 4 pies.\n- Statement (2) alone is also not sufficient because **x** can be any multiple of 3, and the smallest possible value for **x** (which is 3) does not provide enough pies.\n\nNow, let’s combine the two statements to see if they provide enough information:\n\n- From Statement (1), we know that **x** is between 2.5 and 6.\n- From Statement (2), we know that **x** is a multiple of 3.\n- The only possible multiple of 3 within the range 2.5 to 6 is **x = 3**.\n\nFor **x = 3**, we get ⌈x⌉ = 3 pies, which **is not enough** for 30 guests. Therefore, even when combining both statements, we still don't have enough information to conclude that Julie will have enough pies for all 30 guests.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\n\nSince both statements together do not provide enough information to answer the question definitively, the correct answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: E**",

The number of clinks produced when ( n ) people clink glasses is given by the formula ( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} ). This is because each person clinks glasses with every other person exactly once.\n\n2. **Analyze the sufficiency of each statement**:\n   - **Statement (1)**: If two fewer people were seated at the table, there would be at least 17 but no more than 19 fewer clinks.\n     - Let ( n ) be the number of people at the table. The number of clinks with ( n ) people is ( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} ).

The goal is to determine the starting score based on the provided statements.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1): Player A takes exactly 4 turns.**\n\nLet's denote Player A's starting score as ( x ). The points after each turn can be described mathematically:\n\n1. After Turn 1: ( 2x - 80 )\n2. After Turn 2: ( 2(2x - 80) - 80 = 4x - 160 - 80 = 4x - 240 )\n3. After Turn 3: ( 2(4x - 240) - 80 = 8x - 480 - 80 = 8x - 560 )\n4. After Turn 4: ( 2(8x - 560) - 80 = 16x - 1120 - 80 = 16x - 1200 )\n\nFor Player A to end with exactly 0 points after 4 turns, we set the final expression equal to 0:\n\n\\[\n16x - 1200 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for ( x ):\n\n\\[\n16x = 1200 \\\\\nx = 75\n\\]\n\nThus, Statement (1) alone is sufficient to determine Player A's starting score.\n\n**Statement (2): Player A’s starting score was not a multiple of 2.**\n\nThis statement tells us that ( x ) is an odd number. However, it does not provide any specific information about how many turns Player A took or how the points were calculated. There are many odd numbers, and without additional information, we cannot determine a unique starting score.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n\n- **Statement (1)** is sufficient on its own to find the starting score.\n- **Statement (2)** is not sufficient on its own to determine the starting score.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by Selecting the Correct Option\n\nSince Statement (1) is sufficient alone, and Statement (2) does not provide enough information, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

The two statements provide additional information about the relationship between the integers in \\( S \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1)\n**Statement (1)**: When each integer in \\( S \\) is divided by \\( n \\), the sum of the remainders is 11.\n\n- The six consecutive integers in \\( S \\) can be represented as:\n  \\[\n  x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5\n  \\]\n  where \\( x \\) is the smallest integer.\n  \n- When each integer in \\( S \\) is divided by \\( n \\), the remainder is a number between 0 and \\( n-1 \\). The sum of these remainders is given as 11.\n\n- This provides a relationship between the remainders and the divisor \\( n \\), but without knowing \\( n \\) or further specifics about how the remainders are distributed across the six integers, we cannot conclusively determine the value of \\( n \\). There are many possible values of \\( n \\) that could result in the sum of the remainders being 11, depending on the specific values of the remainders.\n\nThus, **Statement (1) alone is not sufficient** to determine the value of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)\n**Statement (2)**: When each integer in \\( S \\) is divided by \\( n \\), the remainders include five different values.\n\n- The six integers in \\( S \\) give six remainders when divided by \\( n \\). According to this statement, there are five different remainders among these six numbers, meaning one remainder must appear twice and the other four must appear once.\n\n- This gives us some insight into the possible values of \\( n \\), because for five distinct remainders (with one remainder appearing twice), \\( n \\) must be at least 5 (since the remainders range from 0 to \\( n-1 \\)).\n\n- However, this alone doesn't allow us to pinpoint the exact value of \\( n \\). There could be multiple values of \\( n \\) that satisfy this condition depending on the specific numbers in \\( S \\).\n\nThus, **Statement (2) alone is not sufficient** to determine the value of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Two Statements\nNow let's consider both statements together.\n\n- From **Statement (1)**, we know the sum of the remainders is 11.\n- From **Statement (2)**, we know that the remainders must include five different values.\n\nWith both statements together, we can narrow down the possibilities. The sum of the remainders being 11, combined with the fact that there are five different remainders, imposes specific constraints on the value of \\( n \\). This reduces the number of possible values of \\( n \\) considerably, allowing us to determine the exact value of \\( n \\).\n\nThus, **both statements together are sufficient** to determine the value of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: C**",

Let's denote these integers as ( n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5, n+6, n+7 ). When each of these integers is divided by ( n ), the remainders will be ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ) (since ( n ) is positive and less than each of these integers).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1):** List L contains two odd values and 5 even values.\n\nThe possible remainders when dividing by ( n ) are ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ). The odd remainders in this range are ( 1, 3, 5, 7 ) and the even remainders are ( 2, 4, 6 ). \n\nFor the list to have 2 odd values and 5 even values, we need to consider the possible values of ( n ):\n- If ( n = 1 ), the remainders would be ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ) (not matching).\n- If ( n = 2 ), the remainders would be ( 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ) (not matching).\n- If ( n = 3 ), the remainders would be ( 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ) (not matching).\n- If ( n = 4 ), the remainders would be ( 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3 ) (not matching).\n- If ( n = 5 ), the remainders would be ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2 ) (not matching).\n- If ( n = 6 ), the remainders would be ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1 ) (not matching).\n- If ( n = 7 ), the remainders would be ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0 ) (not matching).\n\nNone of these values of ( n ) yield a list with exactly 2 odd and 5 even remainders. Therefore, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** No odd integer appears in list L more than once.\n\nThis statement implies that each odd remainder can only appear once. The odd remainders are ( 1, 3, 5, 7 ). If we have 7 remainders total and no odd integer appears more than once, we can have at most 4 odd remainders. This means the remaining remainders must be even. \n\nHowever, without knowing the specific values of ( n ), we cannot determine a unique value for ( n ). Therefore, statement (2) alone is also not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, we need to consider them together.\n\nCombining both statements:\n- From statement (1), we know there are 2 odd and 5 even remainders.\n- From statement (2), we know that no odd integer appears more than once.\n\nThis combination still does not provide a unique solution for ( n ). We can have various configurations of odd and even remainders, and without a specific value for ( n ), we cannot determine it uniquely.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and together they do not provide a unique solution, the answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

If we denote the distance from A to B as ( d ), then the total distance for the round trip is ( 2d ). The average speed being 80 mph means that the total time taken for the trip is ( \\frac{2d}{80} = \\frac{d}{40} ) hours. \n   - If we denote the speed from A to B as ( v_1 ) and from B to A as ( v_2 ), we can express the time taken for each leg of the trip as ( \\frac{d}{v_1} + \\frac{d}{v_2} = \\frac{d}{40} ). This gives us a relationship between ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ), but it does not directly confirm whether ( v_1 > 40 ).\n\n2. **Statement (2)**: It took Reiko 20 more minutes to drive from A to B than to make the return trip.\n   - If we convert 20 minutes into hours, it equals ( \\frac{1}{3} ) hours. Thus, we can write the equation: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{v_1} = \\frac{d}{v_2} + \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   - Rearranging gives us ( \\frac{d}{v_1} - \\frac{d}{v_2} = \\frac{1}{3} ).

Since he buys four items (truffles, caviar, tuna, and grapes) and spends the same amount on each, we can denote the price per item as ( P ).

Given that the product of the weights equals the price in cents, we can express this as ( abcd = P ).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the sufficiency of each statement:\n\n- **Using Statement (1) alone**: We can determine the price per item but not the median price per ounce without knowing the weights of the items.\n  \n- **Using Statement (2) alone**: We know the total weight but not the price or how it relates to the weights.

We need to determine the total number of students based on the information provided in the statements.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1):** The teacher distributed 180 candies and 40 bars.\n\nFrom this statement, we can find the number of students by determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the total candies and bars distributed. \n\n- The number of students must be a divisor of both 180 and 40.\n- The GCD of 180 and 40 can be calculated:\n  - The prime factorization of 180 is (2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5).\n  - The prime factorization of 40 is (2^3 \\times 5).\n  - The GCD is (2^2 \\times 5 = 20).\n\nThus, the possible number of students can be any divisor of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, or 20. Therefore, statement (1) alone does not give a unique answer for the number of students.\n\n**Statement (2):** The total number of items received by each student was less than 20.\n\nLet (n) be the number of students. The total number of items distributed is (180 + 40 = 220). If each student received less than 20 items, we can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{220}{n} < 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by (n) (assuming (n > 0)) gives:\n\n\\[\n220 < 20n \\implies n > 11\n\\]\n\nThis means the number of students must be greater than 11. However, since statement (1) indicated that the number of students could be 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, or 20, we can conclude that the only possible value from statement (1) that is greater than 11 is 20. \n\nThus, statement (2) alone does not provide a unique answer either.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\n\n- **Statement (1)** gives us multiple possible values for (n) (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, or 20).\n- **Statement (2)** tells us that (n > 11), which narrows it down to 20 as the only viable option from statement (1).\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\nSince both statements together allow us to conclude that there are exactly 20 students, but neither statement alone is sufficient to determine the number of students, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: C",

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of these numbers can be calculated:\n- The prime factorization of 27 is ( 3^3 ).\n- The prime factorization of 36 is ( 2^2 \\times 3^2 ).\n- The prime factorization of 45 is ( 3^2 \\times 5 ).\n\nThe GCD is ( 9 ) (the lowest power of common prime factors). Therefore, the possible values for ( n ) are the divisors of 9, which are ( 1, 3, 9 ).\n\nThis statement alone provides enough information to determine the possible number of students, so Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements.\n- Statement (1) is not sufficient.\n- Statement (2) is sufficient.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\nSince Statement (2) alone is sufficient to answer the question, while Statement (1) is not, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nWe need to find out if (3x - 2y = 0) holds true given that neither (x) nor (y) is equal to 0. This equation can be rearranged to (3x = 2y) or (\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{2}{3}). \n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1):** (27x^3 - 8y^3 = 0)\n\nThis can be factored using the difference of cubes:\n\\[\n27x^3 - 8y^3 = (3x - 2y)(9x^2 + 6xy + 4y^2) = 0\n\\]\nSince neither (x) nor (y) is equal to 0, the factor (9x^2 + 6xy + 4y^2) cannot be zero. Therefore, for the equation to hold, (3x - 2y) must equal 0. This implies:\n\\[\n3x - 2y = 0\n\\]\nThus, statement (1) is sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Statement (2):** (9x^2 - 4y^2 = 0)\n\nThis can also be factored:\n\\[\n9x^2 - 4y^2 = (3x - 2y)(3x + 2y) = 0\n\\]\nAgain, since neither (x) nor (y) is equal to 0, we cannot have (3x + 2y = 0). Thus, for the equation to hold, (3x - 2y) must equal 0. This means:\n\\[\n3x - 2y = 0\n\\]\nTherefore, statement (2) is also sufficient to answer the question.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\nBoth statements (1) and (2) independently lead us to the conclusion that (3x - 2y = 0).

This implies that ( N ) can be expressed in terms of ( n ) as follows:\n\n\\[\nN = k(n) + 3 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\\[\nN = m(n+1) + 3 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n\\]\n\\[\nN = p(n+2) + 3 \\quad \\text{for some integer } p\n\\]\n\nThis means that ( N - 3 ) must be divisible by ( n ), ( n+1 ), and ( n+2 ).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1): ( N ) is between 7 and 70.**\n\nThis statement gives us a range for ( N ). However, without knowing ( n ) or how ( N ) relates to ( n ), we cannot determine a specific value for ( N ) that satisfies the conditions. For example, if ( n = 1 ), ( N ) could be 10, but if ( n = 2 ), ( N ) could be 12, and so on. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2): ( n ) is the smallest number with exactly 3 distinct factors.**\n\nA number has exactly 3 distinct factors if it is the square of a prime number. The smallest prime is 2, so the smallest number with exactly 3 distinct factors is ( 2^2 = 4 ). Thus, ( n = 4 ).\n\nNow, substituting ( n = 4 ) into our equations, we can find ( N ):\n\n1. ( N - 3 ) must be divisible by ( 4 ): ( N - 3 = 4k ) for some integer ( k ) implies ( N = 4k + 3 ).\n2. ( N - 3 ) must be divisible by ( 5 ) (since ( n + 1 = 5 )): ( N - 3 = 5m ) for some integer ( m ) implies ( N = 5m + 3 ).\n3.

The least common multiple of ( 4 ), ( 5 ), and ( 6 ) is ( 60 ). Thus, ( N - 3 = 60x ) for some integer ( x ), leading to ( N = 60x + 3 ).\n\nNow, if we consider the range ( 7 < N < 70 ):\n- For ( x = 1 ): ( N = 60(1) + 3 = 63 ) (valid)\n- For ( x = 2 ): ( N = 60(2) + 3 = 123 ) (not valid)\n\nThus, the only possible value for ( N ) is ( 63 ), which is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n- Statement (2) alone is sufficient to determine ( N ).\n\n### Conclusion\nSince statement (2) alone is sufficient while statement (1) is not, the answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

The possible prime numbers less than 70 are: \n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67. \n\nThe units digits of these primes are: \n- 2, 3, 5, 7, 1 (from 11, 31, 41, 61), 9 (from 19, 29, 59, 67).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n**Statement (1):** The units digit of ( P^{(4k+2)} - Q ) is equal to 7, where ( k ) is a positive integer.\n\n- The expression ( P^{(4k+2)} ) will have the same units digit as ( P^2 ) because ( 4k ) contributes a full cycle of 10 (the units digits repeat every 10).\n- The possible units digits of ( P^2 ) for the primes are:\n  - If ( P = 2 ), ( P^2 = 4 ) (units digit 4)\n  - If ( P = 3 ), ( P^2 = 9 ) (units digit 9)\n  - If ( P = 5 ), ( P^2 = 5 ) (units digit 5)\n  - If ( P = 7 ), ( P^2 = 49 ) (units digit 9)\n  - If ( P = 11, 31, 41, 61 ) (units digit 1), ( P^2 = 1 )\n  - If ( P = 13, 23, 29, 43, 53, 67 ) (units digit 9), ( P^2 = 9 )\n  \n  Now we need to check which of these, when subtracted by ( Q ), gives a units digit of 7. \n\n  - If ( P^2 ) has a units digit of 4, ( Q ) must have a units digit of 7 (impossible since Q is prime).\n  - If ( P^2 ) has a units digit of 9, ( Q ) must have a units digit of 2 (possible if ( Q = 2 )).\n  - If ( P^2 ) has a units digit of 5, ( Q ) must have a units digit of 8 (impossible).\n  - If ( P^2 ) has a units digit of 1, ( Q ) must have a units digit of 4 (impossible).\n\n  Therefore, from statement (1), we can conclude that ( P ) must be either 3 or 7, and ( Q ) must be 2. Thus, the units digit of ( P \\times Q ) is ( 3 \\times 2 = 6 ) or ( 7 \\times 2 = 4 ). \n\nThis statement alone is sufficient to determine the possible units digits of ( P \\times Q ).\n\n**Statement (2):** The units digit of the expression ( [PQ + Q \\times (Q + 1) - Q^2] ) is a perfect cube.\n\n- The expression simplifies to ( PQ + Q^2 + Q - Q^2 = PQ + Q ).\n- The units digit of ( PQ + Q ) depends on the units digits of ( P ) and ( Q ). Since ( P ) and ( Q ) can take various values from the set of primes, we cannot determine a unique units digit for ( P \\times Q ) based solely on this statement.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) is sufficient to determine the units digit of ( P \\times Q ).\n- Statement (2) is not sufficient on its own.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince statement (1) is sufficient and statement (2) is not, the answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

Therefore, the total price of the six coats is (6 \\times 85 = 510).\n   - After two coats were discounted by 20%, the average price of the six coats dropped to $76.

Therefore, **Statement (2) alone is also not sufficient.**\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements.\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, we need to check if they can be combined to provide a solution.\n\nCombining both statements:\n- From Statement (1), we know (D) is prime (possible values (2, 3, 5, 7)).\n- From Statement (2), (B) is not prime (possible values (1, 4, 6, 8, 9)).\n\nWe can check the valid combinations:\n- If (D = 5) (from Statement 1), then (B) could be (1) (from Statement 2), leading to (C = 3) (from (35)).\n- If (D = 7), then (B) could be (9) (not valid since (9) is prime).\n\nThus, combining both statements allows us to conclude that (C) must be (3).\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements together are sufficient to determine the value of (C), but neither statement alone is sufficient.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

According to the properties:\n- ( a_6 - a_1 = 16 ) (from the range)\n- The total sum ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 42 )\n\nFrom statement (1), we can express:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 = \\frac{1}{5}(a_5 + a_6) \\]\n\nThis gives us a relationship between the smallest and largest numbers, but we still have multiple unknowns. We cannot determine the greatest number ( a_6 ) solely from this statement, as it does not provide enough information about the specific values of the numbers.\n\n**Statement (2)**: The middle two numbers are 5 and 7.\n\nGiven the median is 6, this means:\n- ( a_3 = 5 ) and ( a_4 = 7 )\n\nNow we know:\n- ( a_1, a_2, 5, 7, a_5, a_6 )\n\nUsing the mean:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + 5 + 7 + a_5 + a_6 = 42 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + a_6 = 30 \\]\n\nSince ( a_6 - a_1 = 16 ), we can express ( a_6 ) as ( a_1 + 16 ). Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + (a_1 + 16) = 30 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 2a_1 + a_2 + 16 = 30 \\]\n\\[ 2a_1 + a_2 = 14 \\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. ( a_6 = a_1 + 16 )\n2. ( 2a_1 + a_2 = 14 )\n\nFrom this, we can express ( a_2 ) in terms of ( a_1 ):\n\\[ a_2 = 14 - 2a_1 \\]\n\nSince ( a_1 ) must be the smallest number, we can find the maximum possible value for ( a_6 ) by minimizing ( a_1 ). If ( a_1 ) is minimized, ( a_2 ) will also be determined accordingly, and we can find ( a_6 ).\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) alone does not provide enough information to determine ( a_6 ).\n- Statement (2) provides enough information to derive ( a_6 ).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince statement (2) alone is sufficient to find the greatest number, while statement (1) is not, the answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

We have:\n1. ( x + y = 16 - (6 + 5 + 2) = 3 ) (total coins)\n2. ( x + 5y = 3 ) (total value)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express ( y ) as ( y = 3 - x ). Substituting this into the second equation:\n\\[ x + 5(3 - x) = 3 \\]\n\\[ x + 15 - 5x = 3 \\]\n\\[ -4x + 15 = 3 \\]\n\\[ -4x = -12 \\]\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nThus, there are 3 one-cent coins. Statement (1) is sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** Among the 16 coins in the jar, there are twice as many 10-cent coins as 1-cent coins.\n\nLet ( x ) be the number of 1-cent coins. Then the number of 10-cent coins is ( 2x ). The total number of coins is:\n\\[ x + 2x + y + z + w = 16 \\]\nwhere ( y ), ( z ), and ( w ) represent the number of 5-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent coins, respectively.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 3x + y + z + w = 16 \\] (1)\n\nThe total value equation is:\n\\[ x + 10(2x) + 5y + 25z + 50w = 288 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 21x + 5y + 25z + 50w = 288 \\] (2)\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express ( y + z + w ) as ( 16 - 3x ). Substituting this into equation (2) does not allow us to isolate ( x ) without additional information about the values of ( y ), ( z ), and ( w ). Therefore, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) is sufficient to determine the number of 1-cent coins.\n- Statement (2) is not sufficient on its own.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince statement (1) alone is sufficient while statement (2) is not, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

This ( y ) is known as the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers from 1 to ( x ).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n**Statement (1): ( y = 10x )**\n\nFrom this statement, we know that the LCM of the integers from 1 to ( x ) equals ( 10x ). \n\nTo find ( x ), we need to consider the prime factorization of ( y ) (which is ( 10x )). The number 10 can be factored into primes as ( 2 \\times 5 ).

Thus, statement (1) does not provide a specific value for ( x ).\n\n**Statement (2): ( y = 60 )**\n\nHere, we know that the LCM of integers from 1 to ( x ) is 60. We can find ( x ) by determining which integers have an LCM of 60:\n\n- ( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 60 ) (so ( x ) could be 5)\n- ( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 60 ) (so ( x ) could be 6)\n- ( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 420 ) (so ( x ) cannot be 7 or higher)\n\nThus, ( x ) can be either 5 or 6. Since we have two possible values for ( x ), statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- Statement (1) does not provide a specific value for ( x ).\n- Statement (2) gives two possible values for ( x ) (5 or 6), but is not sufficient on its own.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and together they do not provide a unique solution, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

The average is 360, but we don't know how the distances are distributed. For example, if the distances were 0, 360, and 720, the median would be 360, which is equal to the average. If they were 180, 360, and 540, the median would be 360, which is also equal to the average. Thus, we cannot conclude if the average is greater than the median based on this statement alone.\n\n**Statement (1) is not sufficient.**\n\n**Statement (2)**: On one of the days, Jingle covered 360 miles.\n\n- If one of the distances is 360 miles, we still need to know the other two distances to determine the median. The average is already known to be 360 miles. \n- The possible scenarios for the other two distances could lead to different medians. For example:\n  - If the distances are 360, 360, and 360, the median is 360 (not greater).\n  - If the distances are 360, 360, and 400, the median is 360 (not greater).\n  - If the distances are 360, 400, and 500, the median is 400 (greater).\n  \nSince we cannot definitively determine if the average is greater than the median based solely on this statement, **Statement (2) is not sufficient.**\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n- **Statement (1)** alone is not sufficient.\n- **Statement (2)** alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by Selecting the Correct Option\nSince both statements alone do not provide enough information to answer the question, and combining them does not yield any new information either, we conclude that:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** The probability is greater than 0.4 that both socks will be white.\n\nThis statement gives us information about the probability of picking two white socks. If the probability of picking two white socks is greater than 0.4, it implies that there are likely more white socks than black socks, but it does not specify the exact number of black socks. Thus, we cannot determine the probability of picking two black socks based solely on this statement. Therefore, this statement alone is also not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\n\n- **Statement (1)** is not sufficient on its own.\n- **Statement (2)** is not sufficient on its own.\n\nNow, we need to consider if the two statements together provide enough information:\n\nCombining both statements, we know:\n1. The probability of the first sock being black is less than 0.3.\n2. The probability of both socks being white is greater than 0.4.\n\nHowever, even with both statements, we still do not have enough information to determine the exact number of black socks or the probability of selecting two black socks. The statements provide probabilities but do not clarify the distribution of sock colors in the drawer.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and together they do not provide enough information to answer the question, the correct option is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

We need to determine if the number of pies represented by ⌈x⌉ is sufficient for each guest to have at least one slice. \n\nTo find out how many pies are needed:\n- Total slices needed = 30 (one for each guest).\n- Since each pie has 8 slices, the number of pies needed is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Pies needed} = \\frac{30}{8} = 3.75\n  \\]\nThus, Julie needs at least 4 pies (since she can't have a fraction of a pie).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\nWe need to determine if ⌈x⌉ (the smallest integer greater than x) is at least 4.\n\n#### Statement (1): (5 < 2x < 12)\n- From (5 < 2x), we can divide by 2:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5}{2} < x \\implies 2.5 < x\n  \\]\n- From (2x < 12), we can also divide by 2:\n  \\[\n  x < 6\n  \\]\n- Thus, we have:\n  \\[\n  2.5 < x < 6\n  \\]\n- The smallest integer greater than (x) (⌈x⌉) must be at least 4 (since (x) can be as low as just above 2.5 but less than 6). Therefore, ⌈x⌉ can take values 4, 5, or 6. \n- Since ⌈x⌉ could be 4 or greater, Statement (1) is sufficient.\n\n#### Statement (2): (x) is a multiple of 3.\n- The multiples of 3 greater than 0 are 3, 6, 9, etc.\n- If (x = 3), then ⌈x⌉ = 3 (not sufficient).\n- If (x = 6), then ⌈x⌉ = 6 (sufficient).\n- We also need to consider if (x) could be any other multiple of 3.

The probability of getting exactly one tail in ( n ) tosses of a fair coin can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\binom{n}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{n-1} = n \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to the range provided (0.1 to 0.2), we have:\n\n\\[\n0.1 < n \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n < 0.2\n\\]\n\nThis is a non-linear equation in ( n ) and requires solving for ( n ).

We need to determine how many points player A started with.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1): Player A takes exactly 4 turns.**\n\nLet's analyze what happens to the score after each turn. \n\n- Let ( x ) be the starting score.\n- After the first turn: ( 2x - 80 )\n- After the second turn: ( 2(2x - 80) - 80 = 4x - 160 - 80 = 4x - 240 )\n- After the third turn: ( 2(4x - 240) - 80 = 8x - 480 - 80 = 8x - 560 )\n- After the fourth turn: ( 2(8x - 560) - 80 = 16x - 1120 - 80 = 16x - 1200 )\n\nFor player A to reach exactly zero after 4 turns, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 16x - 1200 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for ( x ):\n\n\\[ 16x = 1200 \\]\n\\[ x = 75 \\]\n\nSo, from statement (1), we find that player A must have started with 75 points.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact starting score. \n\nFor example, if player A started with 1 point, after the first turn, they would have:\n\n\\[ 2(1) - 80 = 2 - 80 = -78 \\] (not valid)\n\nIf player A started with 3 points:\n\n\\[ 2(3) - 80 = 6 - 80 = -74 \\] (not valid)\n\nContinuing this way, we can see that starting with any odd number less than 80 will lead to a negative score after the first turn.

For example, if ( n = 6 ), the remainders could be ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) (sum = 15), and if ( n = 5 ), the remainders could be ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0 ) (sum = 10).

This implies that ( n ) must be less than or equal to 6, as having five different remainders from six integers means that the maximum remainder value must be ( n-1 ).\n\nHowever, this statement alone does not provide a unique value for ( n ).

Since 3 students are left out and cannot be included in any of the groups, the number of students in each group must be 6, 7, or 8. The only number between 7 and 70 that can be expressed as the sum of 6, 7, and 8 is 21. Therefore, N = 21.",

Let's denote the sum paid for Product X as x. Then, the sum paid for Product Y is 2x (since it's 3 times the sum paid for Product X). The total sum paid for all three products is $500,000, so we can write the equation:\n\nx + 2x + z = 500,000\n\nwhere z is the sum paid for Product Z.\n\nStatement (2) tells us that the trader paid more to purchase Product Z than to purchase Product Y. This means that z > 2x.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements together. From Statement (1), we have the equation:\n\nx + 2x + z = 500,000\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\n3x + z = 500,000\n\nFrom Statement (2), we have the inequality:\n\nz > 2x\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nz - 2x > 0\n\nNow, let's try to combine the two equations and inequalities. We can rewrite the first equation as:\n\nz = 500,000 - 3x\n\nSubstituting this into the second inequality, we get:\n\n(500,000 - 3x) - 2x > 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n500,000 - 5x > 0\n\nSubtracting 500,000 from both sides, we get:\n\n-5x > -500,000\n\nDividing both sides by -5, we get:\n\nx < 100,000\n\nNow, let's go back to the original question. We want to know if the trader paid more than $200,000 for Product Z. To determine this, we need to find the value of z.\n\nFrom Statement (1), we have the equation:\n\nx + 2x + z = 500,000\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\n3x + z = 500,000\n\nWe also know that x < 100,000. Let's try to find the maximum value of x that satisfies this inequality. Since x is an integer, the maximum value of x is 99,999.\n\nSubstituting x = 99,999 into the equation, we get:\n\n3(99,999) + z = 500,000\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n299,997 + z = 500,000\n\nSubtracting 299,997 from both sides, we get:\n\nz = 200,003\n\nSince z is greater than $200,000, the answer is yes, the trader paid more than $200,000 for Product Z.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: D",

This statement alone also does not provide any information about the total number of reindeer in the herd or the probability of choosing Rudolph but not Blitzen and not Comet.\n\nHowever, we can use the information from both statements to find the total number of reindeer in the herd. Let's assume there are n reindeer in the herd. The probability of choosing none of Rudolph, Blitzen, and Comet is the probability of choosing any reindeer other than Rudolph, Blitzen, and Comet, which is (n-3)/n.

This discount reduced the total price of all six coats by $510 - $456 = $54.\n\nTherefore, the total discount on the two coats is $54, which is 20% of the original price of these two coats. This means that the original price of the two coats is $54 / 0.20 = $270.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n(1) One of the discounted coats was the one with the highest original price.\n\nThis statement does not provide any information about the original price of the other discounted coat or the original prices of the other four coats. Therefore, it is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n(2) Before the discount, none of the coats had a price greater than $180.\n\nThis statement does not provide any information about the original prices of the two discounted coats or the original prices of the other four coats. Therefore, it is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\nHowever, when we combine the information from both statements, we can conclude that the original price of the two discounted coats was $270. Since the average original price of all six coats was $85, the original price of the other four coats must have been less than $85 × 6 - $270 = $240.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The original price of the two discounted coats was the lowest among all six coats.\n\nIn this scenario, the original price of the two discounted coats was $270, which is greater than $85 × 6 - $240 = $150. This means that the original price of the other four coats was less than $150, which is not possible since the average original price of all six coats was $85.\n\nScenario 2: The original price of the two discounted coats was not the lowest among all six coats.\n\nIn this scenario, the original price of the two discounted coats was $270, which is greater than $85 × 6 - $240 = $150. This means that the original price of the other four coats was less than $150, which is not possible since the average original price of all six coats was $85.\n\nSince both scenarios are not possible, we can conclude that the original price of the two discounted coats was the lowest among all six coats.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

The mean of a set is the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements. Since x, y, and z are integers, the mean of the set {x, y, z} is (x + y + z)/3. The mean of the set {x, y, z, 4} is (x + y + z + 4)/4. For the mean of the set {x, y, z, 4} to be greater than the mean of the set {x, y, z}, we must have (x + y + z + 4)/4 > (x + y + z)/3. This simplifies to 3x + 3y + 3z + 12 > 4x + 4y + 4z, which further simplifies to 12 > x + y + z. Since x, y, and z are integers and x < y < z, the only way for x + y + z to be less than 12 is if x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3. In this case, z - y = 1 and y - x = 1, so z - y = y - x.\n\nStatement (2) says that the median of the set {x, y, z, 4} is less than the median of the set {x, y, z}. The median of a set is the middle element when the elements are arranged in order. Since x, y, and z are integers and x < y < z, the median of the set {x, y, z} is y. The median of the set {x, y, z, 4} is 3, since 3 is the middle element when the elements are arranged in order. For the median of the set {x, y, z, 4} to be less than the median of the set {x, y, z}, we must have 3 < y. This is true for all possible values of x, y, and z, so statement (2) does not provide any useful information.\n\nSince statement (1) is sufficient to answer the question asked, but statement (2) is not, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

This can be represented as:\n\nt(p) > t(m) + t(n)\n\nSince m + n = p, we can substitute p with m + n, so:\n\nt(m + n) > t(m) + t(n)\n\nUsing the fact that the tens digit of a number is the integer part of the number divided by 10, we can rewrite this as:\n\n(m + n) / 10 > t(m) + t(n)\n\nSince m and n are three-digit integers, we know that 100 ≤ m, n ≤ 999.

Therefore, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 10 to get:\n\n0 > t(m) + t(n) - p / 10\n\nSince p / 10 is an integer, we can rewrite this as:\n\n0 > t(m) + t(n) - t(p)\n\nRearranging the terms gives:\n\nt(p) > t(m) + t(n)\n\nThis is the same as statement (1), so statement (1) is true.\n\nStatement (2) says that the tens and units digits of p are equal.

Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to get:\n\nm + n = 10((m + n) / 10) = 10((m + n) % 10)\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives:\n\nm + n = 10u(m + n)\n\nSubtracting m + n from both sides gives:\n\n0 = 10u(m + n) - (m + n)\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives:\n\n0 = 10u(m + n) - (m + n)\n\nRearranging the terms gives:\n\n0 = 10u(m + n) - (m + n)\n\nThis equation is not helpful in determining whether the sum of the units digits of m and n is at least 2 more than the sum of the tens digits of m and n.\n\nTherefore, statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient to answer the question asked.\n\nFinal Answer: E",

This statement alone does not provide enough information to determine the probability of getting all red balls or at least one blue ball. We know that the number of red balls is greater, but we don't know the actual numbers, so we can't calculate the probabilities.\n\n(2) Less than (1)/(4)th of the balls in the jar are blue. This statement alone also doesn't provide enough information. We know that the blue balls are less than 25% of the total, but we don't know the actual number of blue balls or the total number of balls.\n\nNow, let's consider both statements together. If the number of red balls is more than three times the number of blue balls, and less than 25% of the balls are blue, we can make some conclusions. Let's say the number of blue balls is x. Then, the number of red balls is 3x. Since less than 25% of the balls are blue, we know that x < 0.25T, where T is the total number of balls.\n\nWe can now try to find a scenario where the probability of getting all red balls is greater than the probability of getting at least one blue ball. If we remove three balls, the probability of getting all red balls is (3x - 3) / (T - 3), and the probability of getting at least one blue ball is 1 - (3x - 3) / (T - 3).\n\nSimplifying the expressions, we get:\n\nP(all red) = (3x - 3) / (T - 3)\nP(at least one blue) = 1 - (3x - 3) / (T - 3)\n\nNow, we want to find a scenario where P(all red) > P(at least one blue). We can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n(3x - 3) / (T - 3) > 1 - (3x - 3) / (T - 3)\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n2(3x - 3) > T - 3\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n6x - 6 > T - 3\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n\n6x > T + 3\n\nSince x < 0.25T, we can substitute this into the inequality:\n\n6(0.25T) > T + 3\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1.5T > T + 3\n\nSubtracting T from both sides, we get:\n\n0.5T > 3\n\nDividing both sides by 0.5, we get:\n\nT > 6\n\nSo, the total number of balls must be greater than 6. However, this is not a specific answer, and we cannot determine the exact number of balls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

We can express this mathematically:\n- Let \\( p \\) be the price of an orange.\n- Let \\( q \\) be the price of an apple.\n\nFrom Statement (1), we have the equation:\n\\[ 3p + 2q = 7 \\]\n\nThis equation has two variables (p and q) but only one equation. Therefore, we cannot uniquely determine the price of an orange (p) from this statement alone. \n\n### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)\nStatement (2) states that the price of an orange and the price of an apple are both integers. This information does not provide any specific numerical values or relationships between the prices of oranges and apples. It simply states that both prices are whole numbers. \n\nSince we still have no equations or relationships to work with, Statement (2) alone is insufficient to determine the price of an orange.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Statements\nNow, let's combine both statements:\n- From Statement (1), we have the equation \\( 3p + 2q = 7 \\).\n- From Statement (2), we know that both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are integers.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for \\( 3p + 2q = 7 \\).

From Statement (1), we have:\n\\[ x + y = 3x \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ y = 2x \\]\n\nSince the total amount paid is $500,000, we have:\n\\[ x + y + z = 500,000 \\]\nSubstituting \\( y = 2x \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ x + 2x + z = 500,000 \\]\n\\[ 3x + z = 500,000 \\]\n\\[ z = 500,000 - 3x \\]\n\nTo determine if \\( z > 200,000 \\), we need to check if:\n\\[ 500,000 - 3x > 200,000 \\]\n\\[ 300,000 > 3x \\]\n\\[ 100,000 > x \\]\n\\[ x < 100,000 \\]\n\nThis tells us that if \\( x < 100,000 \\), then \\( z > 200,000 \\). However, we don't know the exact value of \\( x \\), so we cannot definitively determine if \\( z > 200,000 \\) just from Statement (1).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)\n\nStatement (2) says: \"The trader paid more to purchase Product Z than to purchase Product Y.\"\n\nFrom Statement (2), we have:\n\\[ z > y \\]\n\nWe already know from the total amount:\n\\[ x + y + z = 500,000 \\]\n\nWe need to determine if \\( z > 200,000 \\). From \\( z > y \\), we can substitute the value of \\( y \\) from Statement (1):\n\\[ y = 2x \\]\nSo:\n\\[ z > 2x \\]\n\nWe need to check if:\n\\[ z > 200,000 \\]\n\\[ 500,000 - 3x > 200,000 \\]\n\\[ 300,000 > 3x \\]\n\\[ 100,000 > x \\]\n\\[ x < 100,000 \\]\n\nAgain, we don't have the exact value of \\( x \\), so we cannot definitively determine if \\( z > 200,000 \\) just from Statement (2).\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Statements\n\nFrom both statements, we cannot definitively determine if \\( z > 200,000 \\) because neither statement alone provides enough information to solve for \\( x \\) or \\( z \\) directly.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and combining both statements does not provide additional information to solve for \\( z \\) definitively, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

However, it doesn't provide any information about the total number of students or the total number of items distributed. We can't determine the number of students based solely on this ratio.\n\n**Statement (2)**: The teacher distributed a total of 27 pens, 36 pencils, and 45 erasers.\n\nThis statement provides the total number of each item distributed, but it doesn't provide any information about the ratio of pens, pencils, and erasers each student received.

Neither statement alone is sufficient to determine the number of students.\n\nHowever, if we combine the two statements, we can use the ratio from Statement (1) to determine the number of students. Let's say the ratio of pens, pencils, and erasers is 3:4:5. We can use the total number of pens (27) to determine the number of students. Since each student gets 3 pens, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of students.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option**\n\nSince we can determine the number of students by combining the two statements, but not by either statement alone, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: C",

This means that the number of red, green, and blue balls can vary, but we can't determine the exact number of each color.

With both statements, we know that there are at least 3 balls (one of each color) and at most 2 balls of each color, and that the number of green balls is greater than the number of blue balls.

We can use this information to determine the number of red balls, which is at least 1 and at most 2.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n* If there are 2 green balls and 1 blue ball, then there must be 2 red balls (since there are only 5 balls in total).\n* If there are 3 green balls and 1 blue ball, then there must be 1 red ball.\n* If there are 4 green balls and 1 blue ball, then there must be 0 red balls.\n\nIn all cases, the probability of drawing a red ball is different from the probability of drawing a green ball.

Therefore, \\(N - 3\\) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of \\(n\\), \\(n+1\\), and \\(n+2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n#### Statement (1): \\(N\\) is between 7 and 70.\n\nThis gives a range for \\(N\\), but it does not provide any information about the values of \\(n\\), \\(n+1\\), and \\(n+2\\). Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of \\(N\\) from this statement alone. For example, if \\(n = 2\\), then \\(N - 3\\) must be a multiple of 6 (LCM of 2, 3, and 4), and \\(N\\) could be 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, or 63. This does not uniquely determine \\(N\\).\n\n#### Statement (2): \\(n\\) is the smallest number with exactly 3 distinct factors.\n\nThe smallest number with exactly 3 distinct factors is 4, because its factors are 1, 2, and 4. If \\(n = 4\\), then the LCM of \\(4\\), \\(5\\), and \\(6\\) is 60. Thus, \\(N - 3\\) must be a multiple of 60, and \\(N\\) must be of the form \\(60k + 3\\). The possible values of \\(N\\) within the range of 7 to 70 are 63 (when \\(k = 1\\)). This statement alone is sufficient to determine \\(N\\).\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n\n- Statement (1) alone is not sufficient because it does not provide enough information to determine \\(N\\).\n- Statement (2) alone is sufficient because it uniquely determines \\(N\\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclude\n\nSince Statement (2) alone is sufficient, but Statement (1) alone is not, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

Since P and Q are prime numbers less than 70, the possible units digits of P and Q are 1, 3, 7, or 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression P^(4k+2).

The possible units digits of P^2 are 1, 9, 1, or 9, depending on the units digit of P.\n\nHowever, we are given that the units digit of (P^(4k+2) - Q) is equal to 7.

This means the total of the new prices is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 76 = 456 \\]\n\nThe total discount on the two coats is:\n\\[ 510 - 456 = 54 \\]\n\nSince each of the two coats was discounted by 20%, the total discount can be expressed as:\n\\[ 0.2 \\times (\\text{price of first discounted coat}) + 0.2 \\times (\\text{price of second discounted coat}) = 54 \\]\n\\[ 0.2 \\times (\\text{price of first discounted coat} + \\text{price of second discounted coat}) = 54 \\]\n\\[ \\text{price of first discounted coat} + \\text{price of second discounted coat} = 270 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1)\n\nStatement (1) says, \"One of the discounted coats was the one with the highest original price.\"\n\nLet's denote the prices of the coats as \\( p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq p_3 \\leq p_4 \\leq p_5 \\leq p_6 \\). If the coat with the highest original price \\( p_6 \\) was discounted, then:\n\\[ p_6 + \\text{price of another discounted coat} = 270 \\]\n\nThis means the other discounted coat must have a price of:\n\\[ 270 - p_6 \\]\n\nWe need to determine if the coat with the lowest original price \\( p_1 \\) was one of the two discounted coats. Since \\( p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq p_3 \\leq p_4 \\leq p_5 \\leq p_6 \\), and \\( p_6 \\) is the highest, it's possible for \\( p_1 \\) to be one of the two discounted coats if \\( p_1 \\) is one of the lower prices. However, without more specific information about the other prices, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( p_1 \\) was one of the discounted coats.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)\n\nStatement (2) says, \"Before the discount, none of the coats had a price greater than $180.\"\n\nGiven that the sum of the prices of the two discounted coats is $270, if neither of these coats had a price greater than $180, then the only way to achieve a sum of $270 is if one coat had a price of $180 and the other had a price of $90. This means the two coats discounted were the ones with the highest and second-highest prices.\n\nSince the highest price is $180 and the second-highest is $90, the lowest price \\( p_1 \\) must be less than $90. Therefore, \\( p_1 \\) could not be one of the two discounted coats.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Statements\n\n- Statement (1) alone is not sufficient to definitively say whether the lowest price coat was one of the two discounted coats.\n- Statement (2) alone is sufficient to definitively say that the lowest price coat was not one of the two discounted coats.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\nFinal Answer: B",

We need to determine the number of free throws made.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement**\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n**(1) The team attempted 12 free throws.**\n\nThis statement provides information about the number of free throws attempted by the team, but it does not provide any information about the number of free throws made. We know that the team scored 45 points, but we do not know how many of those points came from free throws. Therefore, statement (1) alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**(2) Five-sixths of the team's free-throw attempts were successful.**\n\nThis statement provides information about the success rate of the team's free-throw attempts, but it does not provide any information about the number of free throws attempted or made.

Therefore, statement (2) alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient**\n\nSince neither statement (1) nor statement (2) alone is sufficient to answer the question, we need to consider whether the two statements together are sufficient. Let's analyze the situation:\n\n* Statement (1) tells us that the team attempted 12 free throws.\n* Statement (2) tells us that five-sixths of the team's free-throw attempts were successful.\n\nWe can use this information to calculate the number of free throws made. If the team attempted 12 free throws and five-sixths of those attempts were successful, then the number of free throws made is:\n\n12 x (5/6) = 10\n\nTherefore, the team made 10 free throws.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option**\n\nSince we were able to determine the number of free throws made using both statements (1) and (2), we can conclude that both statements together are sufficient to answer the question.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

We are also given the calorie content of each macronutrient: 1 gram of fat contains 9 calories, 1 gram of protein contains 4 calories, and 1 gram of carbohydrates contains 4 calories.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement**\n\nLet's analyze each statement separately:\n\n**Statement (1)**: One of the meals Bill ate contained 80 grams of carbohydrates, 60 grams of protein, and 60 grams of fat.\n\nWe can calculate the total calories from this meal:\n\n* Carbohydrates: 80g x 4 calories/g = 320 calories\n* Protein: 60g x 4 calories/g = 240 calories\n* Fat: 60g x 9 calories/g = 540 calories\n\nTotal calories from this meal = 320 + 240 + 540 = 1100 calories\n\nThis statement alone does not provide information about the total daily calories Bill consumed, so it is not sufficient to determine if Bill followed the diet program.\n\n**Statement (2)**: Bill ate 1500 calories during the day.\n\nThis statement alone provides information about the total daily calories Bill consumed, but it does not provide any information about the ratio of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine if Bill followed the diet program.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient**\n\nSince statement (1) alone does not provide information about the total daily calories, and statement (2) alone does not provide information about the ratio of macronutrients, we need to consider both statements together.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the statements**\n\nLet's combine the information from both statements:\n\nFrom statement (1), we know that one meal contained 1100 calories.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know that Bill ate 1500 calories during the day.\n\nSince the diet program calls for a ratio of 40:30:30 for carbohydrates, proteins, and fats respectively, we can set up an equation to represent the total calories from each macronutrient:\n\nCarbohydrates: 0.4x = 0.4(1500) = 600 calories\nProteins: 0.3x = 0.3(1500) = 450 calories\nFats: 0.3x = 0.3(1500) = 450 calories\n\nWe can then calculate the total calories from the meal in statement (1) and compare it to the total calories from the diet program:\n\nTotal calories from diet program = 600 + 450 + 450 = 1500 calories\n\nSince the total calories from the meal in statement (1) is 1100 calories, which is less than the total calories from the diet program, Bill did not follow the diet program.\n\nHowever, we can also calculate the total calories from the meal in statement (1) and compare it to the total calories from the diet program:\n\nTotal calories from diet program = 600 + 450 + 450 = 1500 calories\nTotal calories from meal in statement (1) = 1100 calories\n\nSince the total calories from the meal in statement (1) is 400 calories less than the total calories from the diet program, we can conclude that Bill did not follow the diet program.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth statements together are sufficient to answer the question asked, but neither statement alone is sufficient to answer the question asked.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

Statement (1) gives us a relationship between the smallest and greatest numbers, while statement (2) gives us the two middle numbers. We can use this information to find the greatest number.\n\nFrom statement (2), we know the middle two numbers are 5 and 7. Since the median is 6, the two middle numbers must be 5 and 7. \n\nNow, let's use statement (1) to find the greatest number. Let's say the two smallest numbers are x and y, and the two greatest numbers are z and w. We know that x + y = (1/5)(z + w).\n\nWe also know that the mean is 7, so the sum of all six numbers is 6 × 6 = 36.

This statement alone does not give us enough information to determine the remainder when ab is divided by 40.\n\n**Statement (2)**: Each of a²b and ab² is divisible by 40. This statement implies that both a²b and ab² are multiples of 40. Since 40 = 2³ × 5, both a²b and ab² must be divisible by 2³ and 5. This means that a and b must both be divisible by 2² (4) and 5, or one of them is divisible by 2³ (8) and the other is divisible by 5.

If b is 60% greater than a (Statement 1), then b = 1.6a. We can substitute this expression for b into the equation a²b and ab² from Statement 2. This will give us a²(1.6a) and (1.6a)², which are both divisible by 40. We can simplify these expressions to get 1.6a³ and 2.56a².

We know that Reiko drove from A to B at a constant speed and then returned to A along the same route at a different constant speed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement**\n\n**Statement (1)**: Reiko's average speed for the entire round trip, excluding the time spent at point B, was 80 miles per hour.\n\nLet's think about what this statement implies. If Reiko's average speed for the entire round trip (excluding the time spent at point B) was 80 miles per hour, it means that the total distance traveled was divided by the total time taken (excluding the time spent at point B). However, this statement doesn't provide any information about the speed of the trip from A to B or the speed of the return trip. It only gives us information about the average speed for the entire round trip.\n\n**Statement (2)**: It took Reiko 20 more minutes to drive from A to B than to make the return trip.\n\nThis statement gives us a relationship between the times taken for the two trips, but it doesn't provide any information about the speeds. We can't determine the speed of the trip from A to B or the speed of the return trip from this statement alone.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient**\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that Statement (1) alone doesn't provide any information about the speed of the trip from A to B, and Statement (2) alone doesn't provide any information about the speeds either. However, we can combine the two statements to get more information.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the statements**\n\nLet's assume that the distance from A to B is d. Then, the time taken to travel from A to B is d/v1, where v1 is the speed of the trip from A to B, and the time taken to travel from B to A is d/v2, where v2 is the speed of the return trip.\n\nFrom Statement (1), we know that the average speed for the entire round trip (excluding the time spent at point B) was 80 miles per hour. This means that the total distance traveled was divided by the total time taken (excluding the time spent at point B), so we can write:\n\n(2d) / ((d/v1) + (d/v2)) = 80\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2d / (d(v1 + v2) / v1v2) = 80\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n2v1v2 = 80(v1 + v2)\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we get:\n\n2v2v1 - 80v1 - 80v2 = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute v2 = v1 + 40 (from Statement (2)) into this equation:\n\n2v1(v1 + 40) - 80v1 - 80(v1 + 40) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n2v1^2 + 80v1 - 80v1 - 3200 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2v1^2 - 3200 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nv1^2 = 1600\n\nTake the square root:\n\nv1 = ±40\n\nSince the speed cannot be negative, we take the positive root:\n\nv1 = 40\n\nHowever, the question asks whether Reiko traveled from A to B at a speed greater than 40 miles per hour. Since v1 = 40, the answer is NO.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

Then, the total distance traveled for two laps is 2D. The time taken for the first lap is 2D / 20 = D/10, and the time taken for the second lap is 2D / 120 = D/60. The total time taken for both laps is D/10 + D/60.\n\nTo find the average speed, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time. Substituting the values, we get:\n\nAverage Speed = 2D / (D/10 + D/60)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nAverage Speed = 2D / (6D/60)\n\nAverage Speed = 120 / 6\n\nAverage Speed = 20\n\nSince the average speed is 20 miles per hour, which is less than 60 miles per hour, we can conclude that the two statements together are sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option**\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that the correct option is:\n\nFinal Answer: C",

The sum of the original prices is:\n\\[ \\frac{a + b + c + d + e + f}{6} = 85 \\]\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e + f = 510 \\]\n\nAfter a 20% discount on two coats, their new prices become \\(0.8a\\) and \\(0.8b\\). The new sum of the prices is:\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e + f - 0.2a - 0.2b = 510 - 0.2(a + b) \\]\nThe new average is:\n\\[ \\frac{510 - 0.2(a + b)}{6} = 76 \\]\n\\[ 510 - 0.2(a + b) = 456 \\]\n\\[ 54 = 0.2(a + b) \\]\n\\[ a + b = 270 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n#### Statement 1: One of the discounted coats was the one with the highest original price.\n- If \\(f\\) is the highest price and one of the discounted coats is \\(f\\), then the other discounted coat must be one of the remaining five prices.\n- However, this does not necessarily mean that the coat with the lowest original price was one of the two discounted coats. It only tells us that the highest price coat was one of the two discounted coats.\n- Therefore, Statement 1 alone is not sufficient.\n\n#### Statement 2: Before the discount, none of the coats had a price greater than $180.\n- Given that the average of the original prices is $85 and the sum is $510, the prices must be distributed such that their average is maintained.\n- If none of the coats had a price greater than $180, and we know \\(a + b = 270\\), then the only way to satisfy this is if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lowest prices and are reasonably low to allow the other prices to sum up to the required total.\n- However, this does not definitively tell us whether the lowest price coat was one of the two discounted coats. It only sets a constraint on the prices but does not provide a direct link to the lowest price being one of the discounted coats.\n- Therefore, Statement 2 alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements and Decide if One, Both, or Neither are Sufficient\n\n- Combining both statements:\n  - Statement 1 tells us one of the discounted coats was the highest price.\n  - Statement 2 tells us that none of the coats had a price greater than $180.\n  - If the highest price coat is discounted, and the sum of the two lowest prices is $270, it is plausible that the lowest price coat was one of the discounted coats, but it is not definitively proven without more specific information about the exact values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and combining them does not definitively answer the question, we need additional data.\n\n**Final Answer: E**",

Thus, statement (1) alone is insufficient.\n\n   **Statement (2)**: There are 12 members of the board.\n   - Knowing there are 12 members allows us to calculate the maximum number of members that can serve on the subcommittee, which is half of 12, or 6 members.

The product of the weights in ounces of each item is equal to the price in cents paid for each item. We need to find the median price paid per ounce.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement**\n\nLet's analyze the two statements separately:\n\n**Statement (1): Blair spent a total of $46.20 on items.**\n\nThis statement tells us the total amount Blair spent, but it doesn't give us any information about the quantities or prices of each item. We still don't know how much he spent on each item, or the median price per ounce.\n\n**Statement (2): Blair purchased a total of 26 ounces of food items.**\n\nThis statement tells us the total weight of the items, but it doesn't give us any information about the prices or quantities of each item. We still don't know how much he spent on each item, or the median price per ounce.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient**\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that neither statement alone gives us enough information to find the median price per ounce. However, when we combine the two statements, we can start to make some progress.\n\nLet's say the prices of the items are p1, p2, p3, and p4, and the quantities are q1, q2, q3, and q4. We know that p1 = p2 = p3 = p4, and q1q2q3q4 = 4620 (in cents) and q1 + q2 + q3 + q4 = 260 (in ounces).\n\nWe can rewrite the second equation as q1q2q3q4 = 260^4, and divide both sides by 4620 to get q1q2q3q4 / 4620 = 260^4 / 4620. This simplifies to q1q2q3q4 / 4620 = 1048576 / 4620, which is approximately 226.1.\n\nHowever, we know that q1q2q3q4 is an integer, so this is a problem. We can't get an integer value for q1q2q3q4 from the equation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option**\n\nSince we can't get an integer value for q1q2q3q4 from the equation, we can't find the median price per ounce using the two statements together.

We need more information to determine the value of c.\n\n**Statement (2): b is 2**\n\nIf b is 2, then we can rewrite the equation as 10^a * 3^2 * 5^c = 450^n, which simplifies to 90 * 5^c = 450^n.\n\nWe can factor 90 as 2 * 3^2 * 5, so we can rewrite the equation as (2 * 3^2 * 5) * 5^c = 450^n, which simplifies to 2 * 3^2 * 5^(c+1) = 450^n.\n\nNow, we can see that 450 = 2 * 3^2 * 5^2, so we can rewrite the equation as 2 * 3^2 * 5^(c+1) = (2 * 3^2 * 5^2)^n.\n\nThis simplifies to 5^(c+1) = (5^2)^n, which further simplifies to 5^(c+1) = 5^(2n).\n\nNow, we can equate the exponents of 5 on both sides of the equation. This gives us c+1 = 2n.\n\nWe can solve for c in terms of n: c = 2n - 1.\n\nHowever, we still don't know the value of n. We need more information to determine the value of c.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient**\n\nWe have analyzed both statements, and we see that neither statement alone is sufficient to determine the value of c.\n\nHowever, if we combine both statements, we can solve for c. We have b = 2n - 1 and c = 2n - 1. We can equate the two expressions and solve for n: 2n - 1 = 2n - 1.\n\nThis equation is true for all values of n, so we can't determine the value of n. However, we can see that c = 2n - 1 is true for all values of n.\n\nSince we can't determine the value of c, we need more information to answer the question.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option**\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient to answer the question asked, and additional data specific to the problem are needed.\n\nFinal Answer: E",

This statement alone is sufficient.\n\n#### Statement (2): Player A’s starting score was not a multiple of 2.\nThis statement tells us that the starting score \\( x \\) is an odd number. However, it does not provide any information about the exact number of turns or the final score reaching zero. Let's consider the doubling and reduction pattern:\n\n- If \\( x \\) is odd, then after the first turn, \\( 2x - 80 \\) will be odd (since \\( 2x \\) is even and subtracting 80, which is even, results in an even number, and then adding 1 to make it odd).\n- After the second turn, \\( 4x - 240 \\) will be even (since \\( 4x \\) is even and subtracting 240, which is even, results in an even number).\n- After the third turn, \\( 8x - 560 \\) will be odd (since \\( 8x \\) is even and subtracting 560, which is even, results in an even number, and then adding 1 to make it odd).\n- After the fourth turn, \\( 16x - 1200 \\) will be even (since \\( 16x \\) is even and subtracting 1200, which is even, results in an even number).\n\nFor the score to reach zero, the final score must be zero, which is even. Therefore, the number of turns must be even.

Let's denote these integers as \\( x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5 \\). We need to find the value of \\( n \\) based on the conditions provided in the statements.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1):** When each integer in \\( S \\) is divided by \\( n \\), the sum of remainders is 11.\n\nThe remainders when dividing each integer by \\( n \\) can vary based on the value of \\( n \\). The sum of the remainders being 11 gives us a specific condition, but it does not uniquely determine \\( n \\). For instance, if \\( n = 6 \\), the remainders could be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\) which sum to 15, or if \\( n = 5 \\), the remainders could be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0 \\) which sum to 10. Thus, there are multiple possible values for \\( n \\) that could satisfy this condition. Therefore, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** When each integer in \\( S \\) is divided by \\( n \\), the remainders include five different values.\n\nIf there are five different remainders when dividing six consecutive integers by \\( n \\), it implies that \\( n \\) must be at least 6 (since there are 6 integers). The only way to have five different remainders from six consecutive integers is if one of the remainders is repeated. This means that \\( n \\) must be 6 or greater. However, this statement does not provide a unique value for \\( n \\) either, as \\( n \\) could be 6, 7, or higher, depending on how the integers are arranged. Therefore, statement (2) alone is also not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.\n\n- Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n- Statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\nNow, let's consider both statements together. \n\nFrom statement (1), we know the sum of the remainders is 11. From statement (2), we know that there are five different remainders. If we analyze the possible values of \\( n \\) based on these two statements together, we can derive more information. \n\nFor \\( n = 6 \\):\n- The remainders could be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\) (sum = 15) which does not satisfy statement (1).\n- The remainders could be \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0 \\) (sum = 10) which does not satisfy statement (1).\n\nFor \\( n = 5 \\):\n- The remainders could be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0 \\) (sum = 10) which does not satisfy statement (1).\n\nFor \\( n = 4 \\):\n- The remainders could be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1 \\) (sum = 7) which does not satisfy statement (1).\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\):\n- The remainders could be \\( 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2 \\) (sum = 6) which does not satisfy statement (1).\n\nAfter testing various values, we realize that the combination of both statements does not lead us to a unique solution for \\( n \\) either. \n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient, and even when combined they do not yield a unique solution for \\( n \\), we conclude that:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

When these integers are divided by \\( n \\), the remainders are assembled into a list \\( L \\). We need to find the value of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n#### Statement (1): List \\( L \\) contains two odd values and 5 even values.\n\nWhen dividing any integer by \\( n \\), the possible remainders are \\( 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1 \\). Since we have seven consecutive integers, the remainders will also be consecutive modulo \\( n \\). \n\nThe key insight here is that the remainders of seven consecutive integers modulo \\( n \\) will be a complete set of residues modulo \\( n \\) if \\( n \\) is at least 7. If \\( n \\) is less than 7, the remainders will repeat within the first 6 residues.\n\nGiven that the remainders are two odd and five even, let's consider the possible values of \\( n \\):\n\n- If \\( n = 7 \\), the remainders would be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\). This set contains three odd (1, 3, 5) and four even (0, 2, 4, 6) values, which does not match the given condition.\n- If \\( n = 6 \\), the remainders would be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\). This set contains three odd (1, 3, 5) and three even (0, 2, 4), which also does not match.\n- If \\( n = 5 \\), the remainders would be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). This set contains two odd (1, 3) and three even (0, 2, 4), which does not match.\n- If \\( n = 4 \\), the remainders would be \\( 0, 1, 2, 3 \\). This set contains two odd (1, 3) and two even (0, 2), which does not match.\n- If \\( n = 3 \\), the remainders would be \\( 0, 1, 2 \\). This set contains one odd (1) and two even (0, 2), which does not match.\n- If \\( n = 2 \\), the remainders would be \\( 0, 1 \\). This set contains one odd (1) and one even (0), which does not match.\n- If \\( n = 1 \\), the remainders would be \\( 0 \\). This set contains no odd and one even, which does not match.\n\nThe only value of \\( n \\) that fits the condition of having two odd and five even remainders is \\( n = 7 \\). Therefore, statement (1) is sufficient.\n\n#### Statement (2): No odd integer appears in list \\( L \\) more than once.\n\nThis statement tells us that each remainder in the list \\( L \\) is unique. However, it does not provide any specific information about the number of odd or even values or the exact value of \\( n \\). For example, if \\( n = 7 \\), the remainders are \\( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\), and each remainder is unique. But if \\( n = 3 \\), the remainders are \\( 0, 1, 2 \\), and each is unique. Therefore, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements and Decide if One, Both, or Neither Are Sufficient\n\n- Statement (1) alone is sufficient to determine that \\( n = 7 \\).\n- Statement (2) alone is not sufficient to determine the value of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by Selecting the Correct Option\n\nFinal Answer: A",

The statement can be written as:\n\\[ 3O + 2A = 7 \\]\nThis is a linear equation with two variables. Without additional information, we cannot solve for \\( O \\) and \\( A \\) individually. Therefore, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n#### Statement (2) Analysis\nThis statement tells us that the prices of both an orange and an apple are integers. However, it does not provide any numerical values or relationships between the prices. Therefore, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n\nNow, let's consider both statements together:\n- From statement (1), we have \\( 3O + 2A = 7 \\).\n- From statement (2), we know that \\( O \\) and \\( A \\) are integers.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions for \\( O \\) and \\( A \\) that satisfy the equation \\( 3O + 2A = 7 \\).\n\nLet's test possible integer values for \\( O \\):\n- If \\( O = 1 \\):\n  \\[ 3(1) + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ 3 + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ 2A = 4 \\]\n  \\[ A = 2 \\]\n  This is a valid solution.\n\n- If \\( O = 2 \\):\n  \\[ 3(2) + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ 6 + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ 2A = 1 \\]\n  \\[ A = 0.5 \\]\n  This is not a valid solution because \\( A \\) must be an integer.\n\n- If \\( O = 0 \\):\n  \\[ 3(0) + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ A = 3.5 \\]\n  This is not a valid solution because \\( A \\) must be an integer.\n\n- If \\( O = -1 \\):\n  \\[ 3(-1) + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ -3 + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ 2A = 10 \\]\n  \\[ A = 5 \\]\n  This is a valid solution.\n\n- If \\( O = -2 \\):\n  \\[ 3(-2) + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ -6 + 2A = 7 \\]\n  \\[ 2A = 13 \\]\n  \\[ A = 6.5 \\]\n  This is not a valid solution because \\( A \\) must be an integer.\n\nFrom the above, the only valid integer solutions are \\( (O, A) = (1, 2) \\) and \\( (O, A) = (-1, 5) \\).

Since each of the two coats was discounted by 20%, the total discount is \\(0.2 \\times \\text{price of the two coats} = 54\\).\n\nThus, the combined original price of the two discounted coats is \\(54 / 0.2 = 270\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1)\n\n**Statement (1): One of the discounted coats was the one with the highest original price.**\n\n- If one of the discounted coats was the one with the highest original price, it means the highest price is among the two discounted coats.\n- Let's denote the highest price as \\(H\\) and the second highest price as \\(S\\). We know \\(H + S = 270\\).\n\nSince \\(H\\) is the highest, \\(S\\) must be the second highest. This does not necessarily mean \\(S\\) is the lowest price. The lowest price could be any of the remaining four coats, and we cannot determine if it is one of the two discounted coats from this information alone.\n\n**Insufficient Information.**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)\n\n**Statement (2): Before the discount, none of the coats had a price greater than $180.**\n\n- This means \\(H \\leq 180\\) and \\(S \\leq 180\\).\n- Since \\(H + S = 270\\), and both \\(H\\) and \\(S\\) are less than or equal to 180, this is impossible. The only way to sum to 270 with two numbers both less than or equal to 180 is if one of them is greater than 180, which contradicts the statement.\n\nThis contradiction means that the statement is inherently false, and thus, it provides no valid information about the prices.\n\n### Step 4: Combine Statements (1) and (2)\n\nCombining both statements:\n- Statement (1) tells us that one of the discounted coats is the highest.\n- Statement (2) is false, so it does not provide any valid information.\n\nSince Statement (2) is false, it cannot help us determine if the lowest price coat was one of the discounted ones. Statement (1) alone is insufficient to determine if the lowest price coat was one of the discounted ones.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNeither statement alone nor together is sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Final Answer: E**",

Then we have:\n- \\( a_1 + a_2 = \\frac{1}{5}(a_5 + a_6) \\)\n\nThis statement gives us a relationship between the smallest and largest numbers but does not directly provide enough information to determine the greatest number \\( a_6 \\) without knowing more about the specific values of \\( a_1, a_2, a_5, \\) and \\( a_6 \\).\n\n**Statement (2)**: The middle two numbers are 5 and 7.\n\nThis means:\n- \\( a_3 = 5 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 7 \\)\n\nGiven that the median is 6, this aligns with the information provided. \n\nNow we can analyze the set:\n- Since the mode is 7, there must be at least two occurrences of 7. Thus, \\( a_5 \\) and \\( a_6 \\) could be 7 and another number, respectively.\n- The smallest two numbers \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\) must be less than or equal to 5.\n\nNow we can calculate the total sum:\n- The sum of the numbers is \\( a_1 + a_2 + 5 + 7 + a_5 + a_6 = 42 \\).\n- This simplifies to \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + a_6 = 30 \\).\n\nSince \\( a_5 \\) and \\( a_6 \\) must be at least 7 (due to the mode), we can denote \\( a_5 = 7 \\) and \\( a_6 = x \\). Thus:\n- \\( a_1 + a_2 + 7 + x = 30 \\)\n- This gives us \\( a_1 + a_2 + x = 23 \\).\n\nGiven the range of 16, we know \\( x - a_1 = 16 \\) or \\( x = a_1 + 16 \\).\n\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n- \\( a_1 + a_2 + (a_1 + 16) = 23 \\)\n- This simplifies to \\( 2a_1 + a_2 + 16 = 23 \\)\n- Thus, \\( 2a_1 + a_2 = 7 \\).\n\nFrom this, we can find possible values for \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\) that satisfy the conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements.\n\nStatement (1) does not provide enough information to determine the greatest number alone. \n\nStatement (2) gives us a clearer picture of the arrangement of the numbers and allows us to derive the greatest number \\( x \\) based on the relationships established.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion.\n\nSince statement (2) alone is sufficient to find the greatest number, while statement (1) is not, we conclude that:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

It is possible for \\( v_1 \\) to be less than, equal to, or greater than 40 mph, depending on the value of \\( v_2 \\). Therefore, Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Analyzing Statement (2):**\nStatement (2) states that it took Reiko 20 more minutes to drive from A to B than to return from B to A. \n\nLet:\n- \\( t_1 \\) = time taken from A to B\n- \\( t_2 \\) = time taken from B to A\n\nFrom the statement, we have:\n\\[\nt_1 = t_2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\quad (\\text{since } 20 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours})\n\\]\nUsing the relationship between speed, distance, and time:\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{d}{v_1}, \\quad t_2 = \\frac{d}{v_2}\n\\]\nSubstituting these into the equation gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{v_1} = \\frac{d}{v_2} + \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nDividing through by \\( d \\) (assuming \\( d \\neq 0 \\)):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v_1} = \\frac{1}{v_2} + \\frac{1}{3d}\n\\]\nThis equation can be rearranged to express \\( v_1 \\) in terms of \\( v_2 \\) and \\( d \\).

The statement tells us:\n\\[ R > 3B \\]\n\nThe probability of getting all red balls when three balls are removed is:\n\\[ P(\\text{all red}) = \\frac{R}{R+B} \\times \\frac{R-1}{R+B-1} \\times \\frac{R-2}{R+B-2} \\]\n\nThe probability of getting at least one blue ball is:\n\\[ P(\\text{at least one blue}) = 1 - P(\\text{all red}) \\]\n\nGiven \\( R > 3B \\), let's consider the extreme case where \\( R = 3B + 1 \\).

This means \\( y \\) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers from 1 to \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question and the data given.\nWe are given two statements regarding \\( y \\):\n1. \\( y = 10x \\)\n2. \\( y = 60 \\)\n\nWe need to analyze these statements to see if they provide enough information to determine the value of \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1): \\( y = 10x \\)**\n\nFrom this statement, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\). However, we need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( y \\) is the LCM of the integers from 1 to \\( x \\). \n\nThe LCM of the integers from 1 to \\( x \\) grows rapidly as \\( x \\) increases.

We have 6 socks in total, and the probability of both being black needs to be determined.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Sufficiency of Each Statement\n\n#### Statement (1): The probability is less than 0.3 that the first sock selected will be black.\n\nLet \\( B \\) be the number of black socks. The probability that the first sock is black is \\(\\frac{B}{6}\\). According to the statement, \\(\\frac{B}{6} < 0.3\\).\n\nSolving for \\( B \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{6} < 0.3 \\implies B < 1.8 \\implies B \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nThis means there can be at most 1 black sock. However, if there is only 1 black sock, the probability of selecting two black socks is 0. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to determine the probability.\n\n#### Statement (2): The probability is greater than 0.4 that both socks will be white.\n\nLet \\( W \\) be the number of white socks. The probability that both socks are white is \\(\\frac{W}{6} \\times \\frac{W-1}{5}\\). According to the statement, \\(\\frac{W}{6} \\times \\frac{W-1}{5} > 0.4\\).\n\nWe need to find \\( W \\) such that the above inequality holds. Let's test values:\n\n- If \\( W = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\n  \\]\n  This is not greater than 0.4.\n\n- If \\( W = 5 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667\n  \\]\n  This is greater than 0.4.\n\nSo, \\( W \\geq 5 \\). If \\( W \\geq 5 \\), the number of black socks \\( B \\) must be \\( 6 - W \\leq 1 \\). This means there can be at most 1 black sock. Therefore, the probability of both socks being black is 0.\n\nThis statement alone is also sufficient to determine the probability.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statements\n\nBoth statements independently provide enough information to determine that the probability of both socks being black is 0. Therefore, either statement alone is sufficient.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude\n\nSince each statement alone is sufficient, the correct option is:\n\nFinal Answer: D",

This gives us:\n   f(3) = a^6/3 = 16\n   Therefore, a^6 = 16 * 3 = 48.\n\nNow we can see that the values of a^6 obtained from the two statements are different (128 from statement 1 and 48 from statement 2).

However, without additional information about \\( y \\) (the price of an apple), we cannot uniquely determine \\( x \\). Thus, Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** The price of an orange and the price of an apple are both integers.\nThis statement tells us that both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, but it does not provide any specific values or relationships between them. Therefore, we cannot determine the price of an orange just from this statement alone. Thus, Statement (2) alone is also not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements.\nNow, let's consider both statements together:\n- From Statement (1), we have the equation \\( 3x + 2y = 7 \\).\n- From Statement (2), we know that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers.\n\nWe can analyze the equation \\( 3x + 2y = 7 \\) for integer solutions. \n\n1. Rearranging gives us \\( 2y = 7 - 3x \\) or \\( y = \\frac{7 - 3x}{2} \\).\n2. For \\( y \\) to be an integer, \\( 7 - 3x \\) must be even. This means \\( 3x \\) must be odd (since 7 is odd), which occurs when \\( x \\) is odd.\n3. The possible odd integer values for \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( 3x \\leq 7 \\) are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\):\n   - If \\( x = 1 \\): \\( 3(1) + 2y = 7 \\) → \\( 2y = 4 \\) → \\( y = 2 \\) (valid)\n   - If \\( x = 3 \\): \\( 3(3) + 2y = 7 \\) → \\( 2y = -2 \\) → \\( y = -1 \\) (invalid since price cannot be negative)\n\nThus, the only valid solution is \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\). \n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\nBoth statements together allow us to determine that the price of an orange is \\( 1 \\).

However, we cannot conclude definitively without knowing the distribution of colors.\n- Therefore, Statement (1) alone is insufficient.\n\n**Statement (2): The number of green balls is greater than the number of blue balls.**\n- Let’s denote the number of red balls as R, green balls as G, and blue balls as B.\n- From this statement, we know G > B.\n- For the probabilities to satisfy the condition that P(R) = P(B) and P(R) ≠ P(G), we can explore:\n  - If we have R = B, then since G > B, it follows that P(G) = G/(R + G + B) will be greater than P(R) and P(B).\n- However, we still do not know how many red balls there are or how they compare to green and blue.

This gives us:\n  - 2x + y = 5, with y > x.\n- This means we can have specific values for x and y, such as:\n  - If x = 1 (B = 1, R = 1), then y must be 3 (G = 3).\n  - If x = 2 (B = 2, R = 2), then y must be 1 (G = 1), which does not satisfy G > B.\n- The only valid distribution that satisfies both conditions is R = 1, B = 1, G = 3, which leads to P(R) = P(B) and P(G) being different.\n- Thus, both statements together are sufficient to answer the question.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is that both statements together provide sufficient information, but neither statement alone is sufficient.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

Therefore, we cannot determine if the lowest priced coat was discounted based solely on this statement.\n     - **Conclusion:** Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n   - **Statement (2):** Before the discount, none of the coats had a price greater than $180.\n     - This means that the maximum price of any coat is $180. Since the two discounted coats together total $270, and each coat is at most $180, we can conclude that both discounted coats must be priced below $180. \n     - However, this does not provide information about the lowest priced coat specifically.

Therefore, we cannot determine how many free throws were made (successful shots) based solely on this information.

If the range is 360 miles, we can express this as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Max Distance} - \\text{Min Distance} = 360\n     \\]\n   - However, without knowing the specific distances (the actual values of the maximum and minimum), we cannot determine the median. The median depends on the specific values of the distances, and thus we cannot conclude whether the average (360 miles) is greater than the median. Therefore, Statement (1) alone is insufficient.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2):**\n   - Statement (2) tells us that on one of the days, Jingle covered 360 miles.\n   - This means that one of the distances is 360 miles. However, we still do not know the other two distances. The median could be 360 miles (if the other two distances are less than or equal to 360 miles) or it could be greater than 360 miles (if one of the other distances is greater than 360 miles). Thus, we cannot determine if the average (360 miles) is greater than the median based solely on this statement. Therefore, Statement (2) alone is insufficient.\n\n4. **Combining Statements (1) and (2):**\n   - From Statement (2), we know one distance is 360 miles.\n   - From Statement (1), we know the range is 360 miles, which implies:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Max Distance} - \\text{Min Distance} = 360\n     \\]\n   - If we denote the three distances as \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\), and \\(d_3\\) (with \\(d_1 \\leq d_2 \\leq d_3\\)), and knowing one of them is 360 miles, we can analyze the situation:\n     - If \\(d_2 = 360\\), then the maximum distance \\(d_3\\) must be \\(d_1 + 360\\).\n     - If \\(d_1 < 360\\), then the median (which is \\(d_2\\)) is 360 miles, making the average equal to the median.\n     - If \\(d_1 = 360\\), then the distances could be \\(360, 360, d_3\\) where \\(d_3\\) could be greater than 360, which would make the median less than the average.\n     - If \\(d_1 > 360\\), that contradicts the information given.\n   - Thus, we cannot definitively conclude whether the average is greater than the median based on the combined statements either.\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient and the combination does not provide a definitive answer, we conclude:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

However, since we have only found one valid \\( n \\), we might think it is sufficient, but we need to check the second statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2)**:\n   - The statement claims that the probability of getting exactly one head is the same as the probability of getting exactly one tail.\n   - Since the coin is fair, the probabilities of getting exactly one head and exactly one tail are indeed equal for the same number of tosses. Thus, this statement does not provide any new information about \\( n \\) because it is always true for any number of tosses.\n\n4. **Comparing the Statements**:\n   - Statement (1) gives us a specific range for \\( n \\) and we found that \\( n = 5 \\) fits within that range.\n   - Statement (2) does not help us determine \\( n \\) since it is always true for a fair coin.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Statement (1) alone is sufficient to determine that \\( n = 5 \\).\n   - Statement (2) does not provide any additional information.\n\nThus, the correct answer is that statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

Since neither \\( x \\) nor \\( y \\) is equal to 0, the factor \\( 9x^2 + 6xy + 4y^2 \\) cannot be zero. Therefore, \\( 3x - 2y = 0 \\) must be true. Thus, statement (1) alone is sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** \\( 9x^2 - 4y^2 = 0 \\)\n\nThis can be factored as \\( (3x - 2y)(3x + 2y) = 0 \\). Here, we have two possible cases: \\( 3x - 2y = 0 \\) or \\( 3x + 2y = 0 \\). Since neither \\( x \\) nor \\( y \\) is equal to 0, we cannot conclude definitively that \\( 3x - 2y = 0 \\) must be true (it could also be the case that \\( 3x + 2y = 0 \\)). Thus, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

However, without knowing the exact value of \\( x \\), we cannot determine \\( x \\) solely from this statement.\n\n**Statement (2):** \\( y = 60 \\)\n\n- The LCM of the integers from 1 to \\( x \\) must equal 60. We can find the possible values of \\( x \\) by checking the LCM values:\n  - \\( \\text{lcm}(1) = 1 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{lcm}(1, 2) = 2 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3) = 6 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3, 4) = 12 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 60 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 60 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 420 \\) (which exceeds 60)\n\nFrom this, we see that \\( x \\) can be 5 or 6, as both yield \\( y = 60 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Statement (1)** alone is not sufficient to determine \\( x \\).\n- **Statement (2)** alone is sufficient to determine that \\( x \\) can be either 5 or 6, but we cannot find a unique value for \\( x \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

We can express this as an equation based on the number of each type of fruit he buys:\n   \\[\n   0.26a + 0.24b + 0.65c = 5.00\n   \\]\n   where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the quantities of apples, bananas, and cantaloupes, respectively.\n\n2. **Analyzing the statements**:\n   - **Statement (1)**: Clark does not like bananas.\n     - If Clark does not like bananas, then \\(b = 0\\). The equation simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     0.26a + 0.65c = 5.00\n     \\]\n     We can solve for \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) to see if there are non-negative integer solutions. Rearranging gives:\n     \\[\n     0.26a = 5.00 - 0.65c\n     \\]\n     To find integer solutions, we can express \\(5.00 - 0.65c\\) in terms of \\(0.26\\):\n     \\[\n     a = \\frac{5.00 - 0.65c}{0.26}\n     \\]\n     We need \\(5.00 - 0.65c\\) to be a multiple of \\(0.26\\). Testing integer values for \\(c\\) (0, 1, 2, ...) will show if there are valid combinations. However, we need to check if this is sufficient alone.\n\n   - **Statement (2)**: Clark does not like cantaloupes.\n     - If Clark does not like cantaloupes, then \\(c = 0\\). The equation simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     0.26a + 0.24b = 5.00\n     \\]\n     Again, we can express this in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n     \\[\n     0.26a = 5.00 - 0.24b\n     \\]\n     Similar to the first statement, we need \\(5.00 - 0.24b\\) to be a multiple of \\(0.26\\). Testing integer values for \\(b\\) will also show if there are valid combinations.\n\n3. **Sufficiency of statements**:\n   - **Statement (1)** alone allows us to explore combinations of apples and cantaloupes, but we need to check if we can find integer solutions.\n   - **Statement (2)** alone allows us to explore combinations of apples and bananas, but we also need to check if we can find integer solutions.\n\n4. **Combining statements**:\n   - If we combine both statements, we can only buy apples. The equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   0.26a = 5.00\n   \\]\n   This gives:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{5.00}{0.26} \\approx 19.23\n   \\]\n   Since \\(a\\) must be an integer, there are no valid combinations of apples alone that total exactly $5.00.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Neither statement alone nor together provides sufficient information to conclude that Clark can spend exactly $5.00.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nFinal Answer: E",

Therefore, \\( a \\) must be a multiple of 5 in order for \\( b \\) to be an integer (since \\( 1.6a \\) must yield an integer). \n\nLet’s denote \\( a = 5k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).

Therefore, we cannot determine if the overall average speed is less than 100 mph based solely on this statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2)**: \n   - Statement (2) states that Chris drove from Oakville to Toronto at an average speed of no more than 50 mph.\n   - This means the time taken for this leg of the trip is at least \\( \\frac{d}{50} \\) hours.\n   - To find the total time for the round trip, we can express it as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{d}{\\text{Speed from Toronto to Oakville}} + \\frac{d}{50}\n     \\]\n   - Since we don't know the speed from Toronto to Oakville, we cannot conclude whether the average speed for the round trip is less than 100 mph based solely on this statement.\n\n4. **Combining Both Statements**: \n   - From Statement (1), we know the speed from Toronto to Oakville is at least 10 mph. \n   - From Statement (2), we know the speed from Oakville to Toronto is at most 50 mph.\n   - To find the average speed, we can set up the total time:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{d}{\\text{Speed from Toronto to Oakville}} + \\frac{d}{50}\n     \\]\n   - The average speed can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{\\text{Speed from Toronto to Oakville}} + \\frac{d}{50}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{\\text{Speed from Toronto to Oakville}} + \\frac{1}{50}}\n     \\]\n   - To determine if this average speed is less than 100 mph, we can analyze the implications of both statements together. \n\n   If we assume the worst-case scenario for the speed from Toronto to Oakville (10 mph):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{d}{10} + \\frac{d}{50} = \\frac{5d + d}{50} = \\frac{6d}{50} = \\frac{3d}{25}\n   \\]\n   The average speed would then be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{3d}{25}} = \\frac{2 \\times 25}{3} = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.67 \\text{ mph}\n   \\]\n   This is clearly less than 100 mph.\n\n   If we assume a higher speed from Toronto to Oakville, the average speed would still remain below 100 mph due to the limiting factor of the return speed.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   Both statements together provide enough information to conclude that Chris's average speed for the entire trip is indeed less than 100 mph. However, neither statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

Thus, statement (1) is sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** The chance that the coin lands head-side up exactly once is the same as the chance that the coin lands tail-side up exactly once.\n\n- Using the same binomial probability formula, we have:\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Heads} = 1) = P(\\text{Tails} = 1)\n  \\]\n\n- This implies:\n\n  \\[\n  n \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n = n \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n\n  \\]\n\n- This equation is always true for any \\( n \\). Therefore, this statement does not provide any specific information about the value of \\( n \\). \n\n- Hence, statement (2) is not sufficient.\n\n**3. Compare the statements and decide if one, both, or neither are sufficient.**\n\n- Statement (1) is sufficient to determine \\( n \\) (which is 5).\n- Statement (2) is not sufficient.\n\n**4. Conclude by selecting the correct option.**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

When each of these integers is divided by \\( n \\), the remainders will be \\( k \\mod n, (k+1) \\mod n, (k+2) \\mod n, (k+3) \\mod n, (k+4) \\mod n, (k+5) \\mod n, (k+6) \\mod n \\).\n\nThe remainders will range from \\( 0 \\) to \\( n-1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the sufficiency of each statement.\n\n**Statement (1):** List L contains two odd values and 5 even values.\n\n- The remainders can be either odd or even. If there are 5 even remainders and 2 odd remainders, we can infer that \\( n \\) must be odd. This is because if \\( n \\) were even, all remainders would be even (since even numbers modulo an even number yield even results).\n- Therefore, \\( n \\) must be an odd integer. However, this does not uniquely determine \\( n \\) since there are multiple odd integers that could satisfy this condition (e.g., \\( n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ...\\)).\n- Thus, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** No odd integer appears in list L more than once.\n\n- This statement implies that the odd remainders must be distinct. Since there are 2 odd remainders, they must be two different odd numbers. \n- If \\( n \\) is odd, then the odd remainders can only be \\( 1, 3, 5, ..., n-1 \\) (if \\( n > 2 \\)). The fact that there are only two odd remainders suggests that \\( n \\) must be limited in its possible values.\n- If \\( n \\) were greater than 7, we would have more than 2 odd remainders. Thus, \\( n \\) must be less than or equal to 7. The only odd integers less than or equal to 7 are 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n- However, this does not uniquely determine \\( n \\) either, as we still have multiple candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the statements.\n\n- Statement (1) tells us that \\( n \\) is odd, but does not limit it to a specific value.\n- Statement (2) gives us a condition on the odd remainders but does not uniquely determine \\( n \\) either.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude by selecting the correct option.\n\nSince neither statement alone is sufficient to determine a unique value for \\( n \\), and while they provide some information, they do not combine to yield a unique solution either.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E",

This statement provides us with the total number of candies and bars, but it doesn't tell us how many students there were. We don't know if each student received one candy and one bar, or if the distribution was more complex. So, this statement alone is not sufficient.\n   - **Statement (2):** Each student received fewer than 20 items in total (candies and bars). This statement gives us an upper limit on the number of items received by each student, but it doesn't provide any information about the total number of students. Again, this statement alone is not sufficient.\n\n3. **Comparing the Statements:**\n   - Statement (1) tells us the total number of candies and bars, but not the number of students.\n   - Statement (2) gives an upper limit on the number of items received by each student, but doesn't tell us the total student count.\n\n4. **Conclusion and Final Answer:**\nNeither statement alone is sufficient to determine the number of students in the class. However, when we consider both statements together, we can find the answer. \n\nIf each student received fewer than 20 items (from statement 2), and the total number of candies and bars is 180 and 40 respectively (from statement 1), we can calculate the number of students. The total number of items per student is less than 20, so the number of students must be greater than 180/20 = 9, and greater than 40/20 = 2. So, the number of students is between 3 and 9. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**Final Answer: E**",

To determine if this is sufficient, we can try to find a relationship between the prices of different quantities of oranges and apples. Let's assume the price of one orange is $x$ and the price of one apple is $y$. \n   - For 39 oranges and 36 apples, the total price is: 39*$x$ + 36*$y$ = $111\n   - We don't have enough information to solve for $x$ and $y$ uniquely, so statement (1) alone is not sufficient. \n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2):**\n   Statement (2) states that 3 oranges and 2 apples cost $7. We can set up a similar equation:\n   - For 3 oranges and 2 apples, the total price is: 3*$x$ + 2*$y$ = $7\n   - Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find that $x = \\frac{7}{5}$ and $y = \\frac{7}{10}$. \n   - Now, we can find the price of 13 oranges and 12 apples: 13*$x$ + 12*$y$ = 13*$\\frac{7}{5}$ + 12*$\\frac{7}{10}$ = $39.4 + $8.4 = $47.8\n   - So, statement (2) is sufficient to answer the question. \n\n4. **Comparing the Statements:**\n   Statement (1) is not sufficient, but statement (2) is sufficient. \n\n5. **Conclusion and Final Answer:**\n   Since only one statement is sufficient, the correct answer is **B: Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) ALONE is not sufficient to answer the question asked**. \n\nFinal Answer: B",

While this gives us a relationship between the number of pens, pencils, and erasers each student received, it does not provide the actual number of students in the class. Therefore, Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Statement (2):** Statement (2) tells us the total number of pens (27), pencils (36), and erasers (45) distributed. However, without knowing the ratio in which these were distributed, we cannot determine the number of students. For example, if the ratio was 1:1:1, there would be 9 students; if it was 1:2:3, there would be 3 students; and so on. Thus, Statement (2) alone is also not sufficient.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Statements and Decide on Their Sufficiency**\n\n**Statement (1) and Statement (2) Together:** When we combine the information from both statements, we can find the number of students in the class.

We can now set up an equation:\n\n(Number of students) * (Ratio of pens) = Total pens\n(Number of students) * 3 = 27\n\nSolving for the number of students, we get 9. We can perform similar calculations for pencils and erasers to verify that the number of students is indeed 9.

Therefore, Statement (1) alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n   - **Statement (2):** Statement (2) informs us that the thinnest book on bookshelf Y is 20 millimeters thick. Similar to Statement (1), this provides information about the thinnest book on one shelf but does not directly address the median thickness of the combined set of books. Thus, Statement (2) alone is also insufficient.\n\n3. **Comparing the Statements and Making a Decision:**\n   - Neither statement alone provides sufficient information to determine the median thickness of the 50 books. However, when we consider both statements together, we can make an inference. Since the thinnest book on bookshelf X is 2 millimeters thick, and each book on bookshelf X is thinner than each book on bookshelf Y, it implies that the thinnest book on bookshelf Y (which is 20 millimeters thick) is not the median thickness of the combined set of books. This is because the median is influenced by the middle values, and the thinnest book on bookshelf Y is an outlier in terms of thickness.\n\n4. **Concluding and Selecting the Correct Option:**\n   - Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question.

Statement (2) provides a time difference, but we need more information to calculate the speed.\n\n5. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - Option A: Statement (1) alone is not sufficient, so this option is incorrect.\n   - Option B: Similarly, statement (2) alone is not sufficient, so option B is also incorrect.\n   - Option C: Both statements together might be sufficient, but we need to check.\n   - Option D: Each statement alone is not sufficient, so this option is ruled out.\n   - Option E: If both statements together are not sufficient, we might need additional data.\n\nNow, let's consider the statements together:\n\n6. **Combining Statements (1) and (2):**\n   If we know the average speed for the round trip and the time difference between the two trips, can we calculate the speed for the A to B trip?\n\n   Let's assume the distance from A to B is 'd' miles, and the time taken for the A to B trip is 't1' hours, and the return trip is 't2' hours.\n\n   From statement (1), we know:\n   Average speed = Total distance / Total time = (2d) / (t1 + t2) = 80 miles per hour\n\n   From statement (2), we know:\n   t1 = t2 + 20 minutes = t2 + 1/3 hours\n\n   Now, we can set up an equation to find the speed for the A to B trip:\n   Speed from A to B = d / t1\n\n   We can substitute t1 from statement (2):\n   Speed from A to B = d / (t2 + 1/3)\n\n   Now, we can use the average speed from statement (1) to find 'd':\n   (2d) / (t1 + t2) = 80\n   d = 40(t1 + t2)\n\n   Substituting t1 = t2 + 1/3 into the equation for 'd':\n   d = 40(t2 + 1/3 + t2)\n   d = 80t2 + 40/3\n\n   Now, we can find the speed for the A to B trip:\n   Speed from A to B = (80t2 + 40/3) / (t2 + 1/3)\n\n   Simplifying this expression, we get:\n   Speed from A to B = 80t2 / (t2 + 1/3) + 40 / (t2 + 1/3)\n\n   This expression involves the variable 't2', and we cannot determine if the speed is greater than 40 miles per hour without knowing the value of 't2'.\n\n7. **Final Conclusion:**\n   Even with both statements, we cannot definitively answer the question. We need additional information, such as the value of 't2' or the distance 'd', to calculate the speed for the A to B trip and compare it to 40 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nFinal Answer: E",

The question asks if the equation z – y = y – x holds true. \n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (1):**\nStatement (1) tells us that the mean of the set {x, y, z, 4} is greater than the mean of the set {x, y, z}. This means that adding 4 to the set increases the mean. \n\nTo find the mean, we sum up the values and divide by the number of values. So, the mean of {x, y, z, 4} is (x + y + z + 4) / 4, and the mean of {x, y, z} is (x + y + z) / 3. \n\nFor the first mean to be greater, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n>(x + y + z + 4) / 4 > (x + y + z) / 3\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n>12 + 3x + 3y + 3z > 16 + 4x + 4y + 4z\n\nThis simplifies further to:\n\n>-x - y - z > 4\n\nHowever, we know that x < y < z, so this inequality cannot be satisfied. Therefore, Statement (1) is not sufficient to answer the question. \n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2):**\nStatement (2) states that the median of the set {x, y, z, 4} is less than the median of the set {x, y, z}. Since we have an odd number of values in each set, the median is the middle value. \n\nFor the set {x, y, z}, the median is y. For the set {x, y, z, 4}, the median is either y or (y + 4) / 2, depending on whether y is greater than or less than 4. \n\nIf y is greater than 4, the median of the second set is y. In this case, Statement (2) provides no additional information, and we cannot determine if z – y = y – x. \n\nIf y is less than 4, the median of the second set is (y + 4) / 2. In this case, Statement (2) tells us that (y + 4) / 2 < y, which simplifies to 4 < y. This inequality, combined with the given x < y < z, allows us to conclude that z – y = y – x. \n\nSo, Statement (2) is sufficient to answer the question when y is less than 4. \n\n4. **Comparing the Statements and Concluding:**\nStatement (1) is not sufficient, and Statement (2) is sufficient only when y is less than 4.

On Wednesday, Brittany realized she forgot her laptop and had to return to the hotel, which caused her to arrive late at the office.

This selection is exactly half of the total board members, which is within the by-law's limit. Now, we need to calculate the number of combinations to determine if it is greater than 900.\n   - The number of combinations can be calculated using the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!). In this case, n = 12 (total board members) and r = 6 (selected members).\n   - C(12, 6) = 12! / (6! * (12 - 6)!) = 924.\n   - The number of combinations is 924, which is greater than 900.\n\nTherefore, with both statements together, we can answer the question.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\nFinal Answer: C\n\nThe correct answer is C: BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question asked, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question asked.",

The total value of the coins is 288 cents.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (1):**\n   Statement (1) tells us the exact number of 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent coins: 6, 5, and 2, respectively. With this information, we can calculate the total value of these coins:\n   6 * 10 cents = 60 cents\n   5 * 25 cents = 125 cents\n   2 * 50 cents = 100 cents\n   The total value of these coins is 60 + 125 + 100 = 285 cents.\n\n   Now, to find the number of 1-cent coins, we can subtract the value of the known coins from the total value:\n   288 cents (total) - 285 cents (known coins) = 3 cents\n\n   So, there is 1 coin of 1 cent, as 1 cent is the smallest denomination.\n\n   Therefore, Statement (1) is sufficient to answer the question.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2):**\n   Statement (2) tells us that there are twice as many 10-cent coins as 1-cent coins. Let's assume there are 'x' 1-cent coins. Then, there would be 2x 10-cent coins.\n\n   The total value of the 1-cent and 10-cent coins can be calculated as:\n   x * 1 cent = x cents\n   2x * 10 cents = 20x cents\n\n   The total value of these coins is 20x + x = 21x cents.\n\n   For the total value of all coins to be 288 cents, the value of the remaining coins (5-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent) must be:\n   288 cents - 21x cents = 77 cents\n\n   However, we don't have enough information to determine the number of each of these remaining coins that would add up to 77 cents. For example, it could be 15 5-cent coins, or 1 25-cent coin and 1 50-cent coin, or any other combination.\n\n   Therefore, Statement (2) alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n4. **Comparing the Statements:**\n   Statement (1) is sufficient, as it allows us to calculate the number of 1-cent coins directly. Statement (2) is not sufficient, as it only provides a relationship between the number of 1-cent and 10-cent coins, but not their absolute values.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Final Answer:**\n   Since Statement (1) is sufficient and Statement (2) is not, the correct answer is **A: Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) ALONE is not sufficient to answer the question asked**.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

However, it does not provide enough information to determine the value of $x$ uniquely. For example, if $x = 2$, then $y = 20$, but if $x = 4$, $y$ would also be $40$, satisfying the equation. So, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\nStatement (2): $y = 60$. This statement gives us a specific value for $y$. To determine if this is sufficient, we need to find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $y$ is divisible by every integer between $1$ and $x$. Let's try some values:\n- For $x = 2$, $y$ needs to be divisible by $1$ and $2$. $60$ is divisible by both, so this works.\n- For $x = 3$, $y$ should be divisible by $1, 2$, and $3$. Again, $60$ satisfies this condition.\n- For $x = 4$, $y$ must be divisible by $1, 2, 3$, and $4$. $60$ is not divisible by $4$, so this value of $x$ does not work.\n\nSo, statement (2) alone is sufficient to determine that $x = 3$.\n\n3.

The total distance traveled is given as 1,080 miles.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (1):**\n   Statement (1) tells us that the range of distances Jingle covered is equal to his daily average distance. This means that the difference between the largest and smallest distances he traveled is the same as the average distance. However, this statement alone does not provide enough information to determine if the average is greater than the median. For example, if Jingle traveled 360 miles, 360 miles, and 360 miles, the range and average would be the same, but the median would also be 360, and we cannot conclude if the average is greater than the median. So, statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2):**\n   Statement (2) informs us that Jingle covered 360 miles on one of the days. This gives us a specific value for one of the distances, but it does not provide enough information to calculate the average or the median. We need to know the distances for all three days to make a comparison. Therefore, statement (2) alone is also insufficient.\n\n4. **Comparing the Statements and Drawing a Conclusion:**\n   Neither statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. However, if we combine both statements, we can find the distances for all three days and calculate the average and median. With statement (1), we know that the range is equal to the average, and with statement (2), we have one of the distances. We can then use this information to find the other two distances and calculate the average and median.\n\n   For example, if Jingle traveled 360 miles on one day (statement 2), and the range is equal to the average (statement 1), then the other two distances must also be 360 miles to make the range equal to the average. This gives us distances of 360, 360, and 360 miles, and we can calculate the average and median, which are both 360. In this case, the average is not greater than the median.\n\n   However, if the distances were 360, 400, and 600 miles, the average would be 440, which is greater than the median of 400.\n\n   So, by combining both statements, we can determine if the average is greater than the median.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The correct answer is **C: BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the question asked, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question asked.**",

This statement provides some information about the probability, but it does not directly tell us the total number of tosses. We cannot determine the exact number of tosses from this statement alone.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2):**\n   Statement (2) states that the probability of the coin landing head-side up exactly once is the same as the probability of it landing tail-side up exactly once. This statement suggests that the coin is fair, and the probabilities for heads and tails are equal. However, it still does not provide enough information to determine the total number of tosses.\n\n4. **Comparing the Statements:**\n   Neither statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. Statement (1) gives us a range for the probability, but we need more information to calculate the total number of tosses. Statement (2) indicates fairness, but it doesn't tell us how many times the coin was tossed.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Final Answer:**\n   Since neither statement alone is sufficient, we need to consider both statements together. However, even with both statements, we cannot determine the exact number of tosses. The question asks for a specific count, and the statements provide only probabilistic information.\n\n   Therefore, the correct answer is:\n   **Final Answer: E**",

We need to find out how many people are seated at the table.\n\n2. **Analyzing Statement (1):**\n   Statement (1) tells us that if two fewer people were seated at the table, the number of clinks would be between 17 and 19 fewer. This gives us a range for the number of clinks with one less person. Let's denote the number of people as \"n.\"\n\n   With n people, the number of clinks is: n * (n - 1) / 2 (since each person clinks with everyone else, and we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting).\n\n   If there are (n-2) people, the number of clinks would be: (n-2) * (n-3) / 2.\n\n   Statement (1) gives us the range for the difference:\n\n   (n * (n - 1) / 2) - ((n-2) * (n-3) / 2) = 17 to 19.\n\n   Solving this inequality for n, we find that n can be 10 or 11. So, Statement (1) is sufficient to conclude that there are either 10 or 11 people at the table.\n\n3. **Analyzing Statement (2):**\n   Statement (2) is similar; it tells us that if we add two more people, the number of clinks would be between 18 and 21 fewer.\n\n   With (n+2) people, the number of clinks is: (n+2) * (n+1) / 2.\n\n   Solving the inequality for n, we find that n can be 10 or 11. So, Statement (2) also provides sufficient information to conclude that there are either 10 or 11 people at the table.\n\n4. **Comparing the Statements and Making a Conclusion:**\n   Both statements independently lead us to the same conclusion: there are either 10 or 11 people at the table. However, we cannot determine the exact number of people without additional information.\n\n   Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: C**\n\nBoth statements together are sufficient to answer the question, but neither statement alone is sufficient.",

After the first turn, Player A's score becomes double the starting score minus 80. After the second turn, it becomes double the previous score minus 80, and so on.\n     - Let's denote the starting score as $S$. After the first turn, the score becomes $2S - 80$. After the second turn, it becomes $2(2S - 80) - 80 = 4S - 240$. Following this pattern, after the fourth turn, the score would be $2^4S - 480$.\n     - Since the score reaches zero after the fourth turn, we can set up the equation: $2^4S - 480 = 0$. Solving for $S$, we find that $S = 60$.\n     - So, statement (1) is sufficient to determine the starting score.\n\n   - **Statement (2): Player A's starting score was not a multiple of 2.**\n     - This statement alone does not provide enough information to determine the exact starting score. It only tells us that the starting score is odd, but it doesn't give us a specific value.\n     - For example, if the starting score was 3, it would take 5 turns to reach zero (3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 0). If the starting score was 5, it would take 4 turns (5, 10, 20, 40, 0).\n     - So, statement (2) alone is not sufficient.\n\n3. **Comparing the Statements:**\n   - Statement (1) is sufficient, as it allows us to calculate the starting score.\n   - Statement (2) is not sufficient on its own.\n\n4. **Concluding and Selecting the Correct Option:**\n   - Since statement (1) is sufficient, and statement (2) is not sufficient alone, we can eliminate options B, C, and E.\n   - Option D states that each statement alone is sufficient, but we have determined that statement (2) is not sufficient.\n   - Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) ALONE is not sufficient to answer the question asked.**\n\nFinal Answer: A",

This statement provides some information about the remainders, but it does not give us enough information to determine the value of $n$ uniquely. For example, if the integers in Set S are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$, and $n = 3$, the sum of the remainders would be $11$ ($1 \\text{ rem } 3, 2 \\text{ rem } 2, 3 \\text{ rem } 0, 4 \\text{ rem } 1, 5 \\text{ rem } 2, 6 \\text{ rem } 0$). However, there could be other values of $n$ that also satisfy this condition. So, Statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Analyzing Statement (2):**\nStatement (2) states that when each integer in Set S is divided by $n$, the remainders include five different values. This statement provides more information, as it tells us that there are five distinct remainders. However, it still does not give us enough information to determine the specific value of $n$. For instance, if $n = 4$, the remainders for the integers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$ would be $1, 2, 3, 0, 1$, and $2$, respectively, which satisfies the condition of having five different remainders.

However, when we consider both statements together, we might be able to narrow down the possibilities and find a unique solution.\n\n**Combining Statements (1) and (2):**\nIf we combine the information from both statements, we know that the sum of the remainders is $11$, and there are five different remainders. This combination of information might help us identify a unique value for $n$.

We need to find the value of $n$.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Sufficiency of Each Statement:**\n\n   - **Statement (1):** List $L$ contains two odd values and five even values. This statement provides information about the number of odd and even values in the list. However, it does not give us any direct information about the value of $n$. The remainders could be odd or even depending on the value of $n$, but this statement alone does not allow us to determine $n$.\n\n   - **Statement (2):** No odd integer appears in list $L$ more than once. This statement tells us that there are no repeated odd values in the list. While this may narrow down the possibilities for $n$, it still does not provide enough information to uniquely determine its value. For example, if the list contains the remainders $[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]$, then $n$ could be $2$, but if the list is $[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]$, then $n$ could be $4$.\n\n3. **Comparing the Statements:**\n   - Statement (1) alone is not sufficient because it does not provide any direct information about $n$.\n   - Statement (2) alone is also not sufficient as it only gives us information about the absence of repeated odd values, but not about the value of $n$.\n\n4. **Conclusion and Final Answer:**\n   Since neither statement alone is sufficient, we need to consider both statements together to see if they provide enough information to answer the question.
