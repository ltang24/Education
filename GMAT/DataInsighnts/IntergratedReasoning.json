She had them report speed as kilometers run divided by time running, whether they wore running shoes or other athletic shoes, whether they ran on the school track or not, and whether the wind was ≥ 3 meters per second (m/s) or < 3 m/s. She found that, overall, reports of greater than average speeds correlated with reports of both winds < 3 m/s and wearing running shoes. She also found that reports of less than average speeds correlated with reports of both winds ≥ 3 m/s and wearing shoes other than running shoes. The coach hypothesizes that the wind, and not the type of shoes worn, was responsible for the difference in speed.\n\nThe hypothesis indicates that the coach would expect speeds associated with reports of 1 to be less than speeds associated with reports of 2.\n\nSelect for 1 and for 2 the options that create the statement that most accurately reflects the information provided.

The authority’s objective is to utilize the funding from State and Private Sources, while minimizing the dependency on Federal Sources.\n\nA few cities have received generous donations from high net worth citizens; however, this money is not regular and thus excluded in calculating the funding for these long-term development projects. A city is considered inadequately funded if its funding (excluding federal funding sources) covers less than 90% of the city’s projected development expenses. Any surplus funding from state and private sources are deposited in the federal pool of funds used for development projects for the nine cities and may be reallocated among the inadequately funded cities. After the surplus funds are allocated, the federal resources will be used to fund up to 10% for an adequately funded city’s expenses or the amount needed to reach 100% funding, whichever is smaller.",

These centers offered two main types of care:\n\n• Outpatient care, where patients receive treatment during scheduled visits and do not stay overnight\n\n• Inpatient care, where patients stay at the facility during treatment\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, inpatient programs were seen as too expensive and less cost-effective than outpatient alternatives. As a result, there was a general shift toward outpatient care. Private insurers, in particular, began covering fewer inpatient treatments and focused more on outpatient programs.\n\nDuring this period, spending on prescription medications for substance abuse remained a small portion of total treatment costs. Few drugs were available: disulfiram and naltrexone were already in use for alcohol addiction, and acamprosate was added in 2004. Buprenorphine was approved in 2002 for opioid addiction. Methadone, another medication for opioid treatment, is not sold through regular pharmacies. Instead, it is administered at treatment centers, and its cost is counted as part of spending on those centers. Private spending on substance abuse treatment—across all three private payer categories—grew only from $4.6 billion in 1986 to $4.7 billion in 2003.",

Formal channels include institutions such as banks, credit cooperatives, and government agencies. Loans of this type accrue positive interest and are typically court enforced. Informal credit channels include relatives, friends, community members, moneylenders, rotating savings and credit associations, and informal intermediaries. Loans such as these may or may not accrue positive interest. Loans of either type may be used by the borrower for consumption or investment in a business.\n\nIn 1930s rural China, informal credit was sometimes court enforced. However, it was more often self-enforcing, especially in remote areas. With a positive–interest rate loan, the borrower would pay principal and interest. With a zero–interest rate loan, the borrower would repay the principal and provide some non-monetary resource in lieu of interest. For example, the borrower might have supplied land, labor, or draft animal services to the lender.",

          "question": "Biologist: Conservation biologists working to prevent species extinction have long acknowledged that popular species such as lions, eagles, and pandas receive disproportionately large amounts of funding and public attention as compared to less-popular species such as invertebrates and amphibians. Indeed, many of these less-popular species are more in danger of extinction than the more popular species. Although many conservation biologists have accepted this pattern of disproportionate funding, I believe it needs to stop. For, despite the substantial and continuing expenditure of resources on the more-popular species, very few of these species have any chance of escaping extinction.\n\nThe biologist's reasoning is subject to the criticism that the claim that ____A____, which is used to justify the main point, undermines the support for the point that ____B____.\n\nSelect for A and for B the options such that criticism of the zoologist's reasoning is strongest.

While the Greek epics and tragedies dealt almost exclusively with the myths of Greece’s past, lyric poetry, though at times using a mythic background, kept its focus mostly on the present. Stylistically, lyric poetry had a wide variety, as well. Choral songs, such as eulogies, dithyrambs, dirges, and victory odes, were performed by a chorus and an accompanying instrument, usually on public occasions. Solo songs, also accompanied by an instrument, were typically of a more personal nature, with love as their chief subject. Alcaeus’ poetry provided a partial exception as solo songs go, for he also composed songs about politics as well as hymns to the gods.\n\nBesides choral and solo songs, lyric poetry included elegiac and iambic poems, which may or may not have been performed to music. Elegiac poems are defined by meter, and the elegiac couplet, and were usually political or ethical exhortations. Iambic poems were usually polemics, or monologues of a satirical or salacious nature, often, but not always, composed in the iambic meter. Archilochus used iambics and trochaics for his poetry, whereas Hipponax was unique in his use of the choliambic meter.",

While other institutions, in order to combat these costs, have expanded their student classes so that they could increase their overall tuition revenues, our alma mater has resisted such student growth, choosing instead to safeguard its preciously low student-to-faculty ratio—which is a great benefit for students. With a total enrollment of 1600 students in 2010, the College remains one of the smallest liberal arts schools of its kind. Furthermore, the College has increased its average financial aid package every year over the past 25 years, and has offered this aid to an increasing percentage of its student population, in order to ensure that all deserving students can afford to attend, regardless of their financial circumstances.\n\nThis commitment to the students must be financed somehow. This is where we come in: the Alumni Fund directly supports student financial aid. In 2010, 46% of our class of 320 members contributed to the fund, and the total donations were enough to finance exactly two-thirds of one financial aid package. This year we have set a goal of 55% participation. Will you join me in helping today’s bright students afford the same excellent education that we received?",
