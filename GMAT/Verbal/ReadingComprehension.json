                "passage": "To believe a proposition, say corn flakes have health benefits, is to accept it to be true. However, the question of belief is valid only for those propositions that are understandable. An understandable proposition is one that is expressed using correct grammar and known words.\n\nThe dominant view in the scientific community on how human mind believes or disbelieves an understandable proposition is the Cartesian hypothesis, propounded by the seventeenth-century philosopher René Descartes. He said that when an understandable proposition is presented to a human mind, the comprehension of its content happens automatically and passively; however, the assessment of the truth-value of that proposition is a later and deliberate act, the result of which is either belief or disbelief. Thus, this view holds that belief or disbelief in a comprehended proposition is created by rational assessment, and till such an assessment is made, the intellect neither affirms nor denies a comprehended proposition. It also suggests that the mental effort required to create belief and disbelief is the same: the effort required to assess the comprehended proposition.\n\nIn contrast, Descartes's near-contemporary Baruch Spinoza suggested that comprehension of and belief in an understandable proposition happen together, automatically and passively; he said that it is not possible to understand a proposition without, at least temporarily, accepting it to be true. On later, willful assessment, if one judges the believed proposition to be false, it may be unaccepted (disbelieved), and if judged to be true, one may continue to believe in it. Thus, as per the Spinozan hypothesis, the default setting of the human mind is to believe every understandable proposition that is presented to it; disbelief is possible but it comes – if it comes at all – from effortful, deliberate assessment done after the initial comprehension-belief.\n\nBoth hypotheses continue to have their proponents and opponents. It is, however, a common observation that doubt, suspension of judgment and disbelief are mentally taxing tasks while we naturally – effortlessly – accept and believe most of what we see, hear and read. Research has proved that we systematically err on the side of believing too much, as opposed to rejecting too much. This inherent credulity of the human mind is, in fact, the founding axiom of the fields of advertising and propaganda.\n\nAdapted from a research paper by Professor Daniel Gilbert",

                "passage": "Chief Executive Officers are often driven more by their short-term personal interests than by the long-term good of their company. Therefore, it is a critical responsibility of the board of directors to ensure that executive compensation is linked to such performance targets that cannot be easily gamed by the CEO and so, can be achieved only if he creates actual and sustainable value for the company. Only such performance targets may be deemed to be good. Also, since they are difficult to manipulate, CEOs would statistically be as likely to meet these targets as to miss them; it is unlikely that, if no manipulation takes place, CEOs will just overperform most of the time. However, recent research has found that, in actual practice, CEOs meet their targets far often than they miss them.\n\nThe performance targets of CEOs are often based on a single metric such as quarterly profitability or earnings per share. Such a system can be easily manipulated by them – by, for example, cutting the research and development spending that is critical for the organization's future. In contrast, when their payouts depend on three to five performance targets – based on metrics that are not closely correlated – CEOs are found to be just as likely to miss a given target as they are to exceed it.\n\nBoards often determine their CEO's performance goals based on the company and sector growth forecasts provided by external analysts and the CEO himself. In self-interest, CEOs often lowball forecasts to get easily achievable targets. However, the resulting low performance targets prevent their company from growing to its full potential. Another feature of the executive compensation structure compounds this problem. Most boards specify a minimum performance threshold for their CEOs, below which the CEO receives no bonus. Then, his rewards rise steeply until the target is reached. Rewards for performing beyond this target grow much more slowly and eventually taper off. Thus, a CEO does not receive much personal profit from achieving spectacular results as opposed to merely satisfactory ones and, therefore, rarely strives for them. The result of all this is a sated CEO but a stunted company.\n\nAdapted from https://hbr.org/2017/09/comp-targets-that-work",

                "passage": "While there is no blueprint for transforming a largely government-controlled economy into a free one, the experience of the United Kingdom since 1979 clearly shows one approach that works: privatization, in which state-owned industries are sold to private companies. By 1979, the total borrowings and losses of state-owned industries were running at about £3 billion a year. By selling many of these industries, the government has decreased these borrowings and losses, gained over £34 billion from the sales, and now receives tax revenues from the newly privatized companies. Along with a dramatically improved overall economy, the government has been able to repay 12.5 percent of the net national debt over a two-year period. In fact, privatization has not only rescued individual industries and a whole economy headed for disaster, but also raised the level of performance in every area. At British Airways and British Gas, for example, productivity per employee has risen by 20 percent. At Associated British Ports, labor disruptions common in the 1970’s and early 1980’s have now virtually disappeared. At British Telecom, there is no longer a waiting list—as there always was before privatization—to have a telephone installed. Part of this improved productivity has come about because the employees of privatized industries were given the opportunity to buy shares in their own companies. They responded enthusiastically to the offer of shares: at British Aerospace, 89 percent of the eligible workforce bought shares; at Associated British Ports, 90 percent; and at British Telecom, 92 percent. When people have a personal stake in something, they think about it, care about it, work to make it prosper. At the National Freight Consortium, the new employee-owners grew so concerned about their company’s profits that during wage negotiations they actually pressed their union to lower its wage demands. Some economists have suggested that giving away free shares would provide a needed acceleration of the privatization process. Yet they miss Thomas Paine’s point that “what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly.” In order for the far- ranging benefits of individual ownership to be achieved by owners, companies, and countries, employees and other individuals must make their own decisions to buy, and they must commit some of their own resources to the choice.

                "passage": "Schools expect textbooks to be a valuable source of information for students. My research suggests, however, that textbooks that address the place of Native Americans within the history of the United States distort history to suit a particular cultural value system. In some textbooks, for example, settlers are pictured as more humane, complex, skillful, and wise than Native Americans. In essence, textbooks stereotype and depreciate the numerous Native American cultures while reinforcing the attitude that the European conquest of the New World denotes the superiority of European cultures. Although textbooks evaluate Native American architecture, political systems, and homemaking, I contend that they do it from an ethnocentric, European perspective without recognizing that other perspectives are possible.One argument against my contention asserts that, by nature, textbooks are culturally biased and that I am simply underestimating children's ability to see through these biases. Some researchers even claim that by the time students are in high school, they know they cannot take textbooks literally. Yet substantial evidence exists to the contrary. Two researchers, for example, have conducted studies that suggest that children's attitudes about particular cultures are strongly influenced by the textbooks used in schools. Given this, an ongoing, careful review of how school textbooks depict Native Americans is certainly warranted.",

            "passage": "Some writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or no distinction between them, whereas they are not only entirely different, but have different origins. Society is a blessing brought forth naturally by our wants, uniting our affections and promoting our happiness. Government is a necessary evil originating from the need to restrain our vices. Suppose a small number of persons represent the first peopling of any country, or of the world. In this state of natural liberty, a thousand motives will excite them to society: the strength of one is so unequal to his wants, and his mind so unfitted for perpetual solitude, that he is soon obliged to seek assistance and relief from another, who in turn requires the same. Considering the slavish times in which it developed, the form of government known as ―constitutional monarchy‖ is granted to have been a noble creation. When the world was overrun with tyranny, the least remove therefrom was a glorious rescue. However, government, if unchecked, evolves over time to a form so complex that a nation may suffer for years without being able to discover in which part the fault lies; and every political physician will advise a different medicine. Four or five united in a society would be able to raise a dwelling, but one might labour out the period of life without accomplishing anything. Disease or misfortune could soon reduce an individual to a state in which he could easily perish. As time passes, however, in proportion as they surmount their early difficulties, the people will inevitably relax in their duty and attachment to each other; and this laxity will point out the necessity for each to surrender a part of his property in order to establish some form of government to protect the rest. Here then is the origin of government: the inability of moral virtue to govern the world; here, too, is the design and end of government: freedom and security. And it unanswerably follows that whatever form of government which appears most likely to ensure the protection which constitutes government‘s essential purpose, with the least expense, is preferable to all others. As the community expands, public concerns will increase and the distance at which the members are separated may render it inconvenient for all to meet on every occasion. Thus the members may consent to leave the legislative part to be managed by a number of chosen representatives, who are supposed to have the same concerns as those who appointed them, and who will act in the same manner as the whole would, if present. That the interest of every part of the colony may be attended to, the whole may be divided into convenient parts, each part sending its proper number. And so that there be assured a common interest with every part of the community, on which the strength of government depends, prudence will point to the need for frequent elections, thereby assuring that the elected return and mix often with the community.

Should we find them too different from our accent of thought, of feeling, of speech, in a thousand minute particulars which are of the essence of all three? Dr. Doran's long and interesting records of the triumphs of Garrick, and other less familiar, but in their day hardly less astonishing, players, do not relieve one of the doubt. Garrick himself, as sometimes happens with people who have been the subject of much anecdote and other conversation, here as elsewhere, bears no very distinct figure. One hardly sees the wood for the trees. On the other hand, the account of Betterton, 'perhaps the greatest of English actors,' is delightfully fresh. That intimate friend of Dryden, Tillotson, Pope, who executed a copy of the actor's portrait by Kneller which is still extant, was worthy of their friendship; his career brings out the best elements in stage life. The stage in these volumes presents itself indeed not merely as a mirror of life, but as an illustration of the utmost intensity of life, in the fortunes and characters of the players. Ups and downs, generosity, dark fates, the most delicate goodness, have nowhere been more prominent than in the private existence of those devoted to the public mimicry of men and women. Contact with the stage, almost throughout its history, presents itself as a kind of touchstone, to bring out the bizarrerie, the theatrical tricks and contrasts, of the actual world.",

                "passage": "The Seventh Symphony (1812) was, at the time, Beethoven’s last and vibrant word on the big style he had cultivated in the previous decade. In the Eighth Symphony (1814) he does something new by seeming to return to something old. He writes, that is, a symphony shorter than any since his First. It is almost as though he wanted to call his entire development throughout that decade into question. Indeed, over the remaining years of his life he would confidently explore in opposite directions, writing bigger pieces than before and ones more compressed, his most rhetorical music and his most inward, his most public and his most esoteric, compositions that plumb the inexhaustible possibilities of the sonata style and those that propose utterly new ways of organizing material, music reaching extremes of the centered and the bizarre. If, however, we think of the Eight as a nostalgic return to the good old days, we misunderstand it. To say it is 1795 revisited from the vantage point of 1812 is not right either. What interests Beethoven is not so much brevity for its own sake — and certainly not something called “classicism” — as concentration. It is as though he were picking up where he had left off in the densely saturated first movement of the Fifth Symphony to produce another tour de force of tight packing. He had already done something like this two years earlier in one of his most uncompromising works, the F-minor String Quartet, Op. 95. But a symphony is not a “private” connoisseur’s music like a string quartet; by comparison, the Eighth Symphony is Opus 95’s friendly, open-featured cousin, even though its first and last movements bring us some of the most violent moments in Beethoven.",

                "passage": "Virginia Woolf made an original contribution to the form of the novel, but was also a distinguished essayist, a critic for The Times Literary Supplement, and a central figure of the Bloomsbury group. Dialogic in style and continually questioning what may be the reader‘s opinion (her rejection of an authoritative voice links her to the tradition of Montaigne), her critical essays, when examined carefully, reveal a thematic and technical complexity that rivals her novels.\n\nSome of her most rigorous essays suggest that the personality of the author can be fixed if sufficient evidence can be amassed and if its logical implications are followed. In 'The Novels of Turgenev,' Woolf pursues the problem of interpretation on the part of the reader by providing a detailed report of her own response to Turgenev. She does this in order to make possible the question that leaps the gap between reader and text. That question—'what principles guided Turgenev?'—focuses on the fictional strategies that must have been in operation in order to have produced Woolf's experience. Thus Woolf accounts for this by reconstructing Turgenev‘s method. But she pushes farther insofar as she asserts that the method must be a sign of a deeper informing power, the mind of Turgenev itself. This distance can be traversed by interpretation, Woolf argues, because writers like Turgenev achieve a level of personality beneath the surface distinctions among individuals. Her greatest examples of this impersonal power in the English language are Jane Austen and Shakespeare. According to Woolf, these authors write with a 'clarity of heart and spirit' that allows their potential for genius to express itself 'whole and entire.' Unencumbered by impediments that would be erected by such feelings on their part as fear, hatred, or dependency, we are allowed by their art to make contact with what is most deeply personal, and therefore most widely human, in them.\n\nBut one of the riches of Woolf‘s essays is that they critique this very same possibility of closing the gap that exists between author and audience. This is evinced in Woolf‘s awareness of the contemporary artist‘s self-consciousness: the enemy of human contact and knowing. There seem to be so many barriers on the road to the deepest level of self that the journey there is impossible, but it is this level of self through which the gap must be closed. In fact, Woolf asserts that the journey is impossible for the modern writer. In 'How It Strikes a Contemporary,' Woolf contrasts writers of the past—Chaucer is her most powerful example—who believed wholeheartedly in an atemporal order verified by the entire culture, with modern writers who have lost this advantage. Woolf suggests that, if, for writer and reader, no way to a shared, universal level of experience is available, the very ground of the interpretive enterprise is removed.",

                "passage": "In all industrial countries, the seventies were a time of slowdown in real economic growth. In some countries, people resisted the decline in real income growth and tried to maintain their accustomed growth in living standards by demanding higher wages and salaries. In other countries, where there was a higher degree of ‘social consensus’, it was recognized that such a wage-price spiral would be damaging to the society as a whole, and people accepted the lower real income growth without demanding a pushing up of wages and prices. In testing this hypothesis, researchers examined the experience of eighteen industrial countries in the seventies. It was seen that the differences in the inflation performances of these countries were well-explained by the indicator representing the degrees of social consciousness.\n\nTwo rationales are advanced for the role of social consensus. The first is based on conflict over the distribution of a known loss in aggregate real income, while the second is based on imperfect information regarding the size of the loss. The two rationales are not mutually exclusive, but the first represents a greater departure from economic orthodoxy than the second. Let us first suppose that there is a big increase in the price of imported oil and that the size of the resulting loss of aggregate real income is known to all. In countries having a high degree of consensus, each group of individuals may be willing to scale down its claim on output in the same proportion as the aggregate reduction. On the other hand, in countries lacking such consensus, there may be an unwillingness to scale down demands. In the latter case, inflationary pressures will emerge even though the process is ultimately likely to be counterproductive or irrational from the point of view of the society as a whole.\n\nAccording to the second rationale, workers demand no more than what is warranted by productivity, and if they know that productivity has fallen or oil prices have increased, they are willing to accept a lower wage. However, workers will not generally have enough information to know the value of their contribution to production, and they will not necessarily believe statements by the firm that productivity growth has declined. They will not be certain whether such statements are true or whether these statements represent attempts by the firm to cheat them. Statements by the firms will have greater credibility where the firms have established a reputation for fairness than where there is a high degree of mistrust between workers and employers. The greater the degree of trust, the less will be the workers’ resistance to reduction in the level or growth rate of real wage.\n\nBoth rationales suggest that real wages may be relatively inflexible, at least in downward direction, when there is a lack of social consensus.",

                "passage": "In Manhattan, the beauty of the night sky is only a faded metaphor, the shopworn verse of an outdated love song. The stars shine no brighter at midnight in midtown than the ones depicted on the time-dimmed ceiling of the waiting room at Grand Central Terminal. The eternal orange glow of the city lights leaves only the faintest hints of the blackness beyond. And when the sky is truly clear and the clouds do not reflect this amber aura, the brightness of the city environs constrict the pupils so much that only the moon can be seen on most evenings. But over the last few weeks it has been possible, even in Manhattan, to watch the evening star—Venus—descending in the west, presenting her orbit, edgewise, to viewers on Earth.\n\nVenus is the luminous body hanging over New Jersey to the west in the early evening. In spite of the fact that it emanates no light of its own—only reflecting light from its neighbour and provider, the sun—it is brighter than any heavenly object visible from Earth except the sun and the moon. For the moment, Venus becomes apparent at twilight, about a third of the way up the western sky, and it sets around 11. Every night people go to bed wondering what strangely bright star that is. To those who live in New York City, it may be the only star they see when trapped on this tiny little island. Whatever the case, in the morning no one remembers that luminous body any longer.\n\nTo say, as one must, that Venus is not a star but a planet seems ungrateful, almost pedantic. Astronomers might have us know that this distinction is not a mere splitting of hairs, but the most basic of divisions, not unlike that of plants and animals. Be that as it may, it is the kind of technicality the English essayist Charles Lamb had in mind when defending the generosity of his personal ignorance almost 200 years ago. 'I guess at Venus,' he wrote, 'only by her brightness.' Lamb was no Copernican, and neither are most of us. We are little Ptolemies every one. The sun rises and sets upon us. When one lies upon a meadow late at night, etherized by the fullness of the sky, it is all one can do to marvel at the celestial bodies above.",

                "passage": "As urbanization continues to accelerate, many urban areas in developing countries are becoming densely populated and choked with traffic and air pollution. This expanding urbanization coincides with the rise of a suburban middle class made up of professionals who commute into the urban core each day. This new class of workers, college educated and computer literate, has chosen to stay at home, instead of moving to North America or Europe for work. However, if developing countries cannot find a way to manage their traffic congestion, they risk losing out to those places that can. One solution is congestion pricing. This scheme, implemented in various forms by cities such as London and Singapore, charges drivers a fee to enter a given area during peak traffic times. By implementing congestion pricing, developing countries could reduce fuel consumption and air pollution, decrease the economic loss due to wasted time spent in traffic, and raise revenue that could be used to develop infrastructure such as mass transit.\nCongestion pricing has proven to be more than just a form of traffic mitigation; it has made cities more livable. Since setting up its “Area Licensing Scheme” in the 1970s, Singapore has been transformed. Traffic jams have virtually disappeared as the number of vehicles entering the congestion pricing area has declined by 76%. Since 2003 when London introduced its system, average commuting times have declined by 14%. At the same time, public transportation usage and bicycle ridership have increased sharply in both cities and air pollution has been dramatically reduced.\nCongestion pricing advocates characterize what has happened in London and Singapore as a “virtuous cycle”—a positive feedback loop with beneficial externalities. When drivers are charged a fee, many of them will choose to take public transportation or to bicycle instead. This reduces the number of vehicles on the road. At the same time, those who decide that it is worth it to drive and pay the fee will spend less time in stop and go traffic. Car drivers and bus passengers experience the benefit of reduced commuting times and both cars and buses waste less fuel idling in stalled traffic. Meanwhile, the money raised can be used to fund the expansion of public transportation and improvement of infrastructure such as roads and bicycle paths. These improvements in turn reduce commuting times and make it more convenient to take public transportation.\nCritics have argued that congestion pricing could actually have the opposite effect of that intended. Citing an economic principle known as “induced demand,” they contend that the congestion pricing could become a victim of its own success. As traffic eases, driving becomes a more desirable option, thus leading to the same traffic problems as before. However, these critics forget that “there’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Congestion pricing forces drivers to bear the true economic costs of their actions. While some may choose to continue driving, that choice now comes with a price tag and the money raised will benefit those who choose not to.",

                "passage": "The rate at which pollen settles is dictated principally by the size and density of the grain. The slower the settlement rate, the greater the dispersal range. Numerous species reduce the density of their pollen grains through air cavities in their walls. The grains of many species quickly dehydrate after release.\nThere is a limit, however, to the lower range of pollen size. The smaller a particle becomes, the more difficult its capture, because as airflow carrying particles sweeps past surfaces, inertia represents a principal component of the mechanism for capture. Usually considered a―primitive‖ feature in textbooks, wind-pollination has, in fact, reappeared independently in many plant groups relatively recently in geological time.\nGeneral textbooks still often give the impression that the anemophilous syndrome is rather uninteresting, often defining it mainly as a combination of negatives: a lack of nectar, scent, petals, etc. Wind pollination has traditionally been viewed as a reproductive process dominated by random events—the vagaries of the wind and weather. This view seems justified by the potential hazards a pollen grain is subject to when transported over long distances.\nPollen loss through happenstance is compensated for in wind-pollinated plants to a large degree by pollen-to-ovule ratios that greatly exceed those of insect-pollinated species. And unlike the sticky pollen grains of plants pollinated by insects, the pollen grains of wind-pollinated plants are smooth and dry, to avoid clumping and precipitating, and the stigma of the female is huge, sticky, and feathery, the better to catch any floating pollen grains. Similarly, wind-pollinated plants typically evolved to grow in stands, such as pine forests, corn fields and grasslands. Indeed the wind vector is only useful in large, near-monoculture populations.\nHowever, recent research has shown that several remarkably sophisticated mechanisms for dispersal and capture are characteristic of wind-pollinated plants. Pollen release is often tied to the recognition of unambiguous environmental clues. The devices that operate to prevent self-pollination are also sometimes extremely intricate. Many species take advantage of the physics of pollen motion by generating aerodynamic environments within the immediate vicinity of their reproductive organs. Two biological features appear to be critical in this process: the density and size of the pollen grain and the morphology of the ovulate organ.\nThe shape of the female organ creates patterns of airflow disturbances through which pollen grains travel. The obstructing organ causes airflow to separate around windward surfaces and creates turbulence along leeward surfaces as ambient wind speeds increase. Because the geometry of female organs is often species-specific, airflow disturbance patterns that are also species-specific can be generated. The speed and direction of this pattern combines with the physical properties of a species‘ pollen to produce a highly synergistic pattern of pollen collision on windward surfaces and sedimentation on leeward surfaces of reproductive organs. The aerodynamic consequences of this synergism can significantly increase the pollen-capture efficiency of an ovulate organ.",

However, for enterprise technology, increased global connectivity is raising the stakes on both sides of the equation. The commercial rewards from tapping into this connectivity are enormous, but the more tightly we are connected, the more vulnerabilities exist that attackers can exploit and the more damage they can do once inside. Therefore, when a manufacturer invests in a new product life-cycle management system, it is making a bet that the system will not enable the theft of valuable intellectual property. When a retailer invests in mobile commerce, it is betting that cyber-fraud won’t critically damage profitability. When a bank invests in customer analytics, it is betting that the sensitive data it analyses won’t be stolen by cyber-criminals. The odds on all those bets appear to be shifting away from the institutions and toward cyber-attackers. They could swing decisively their way in the near future given most companies’ siloed and reactive approach to cybersecurity.\n\nOur interviews with business leaders, chief information officers (CIOs), chief technology officers (CTOs), and chief information security officers (CISOs) indicate that concerns about cyber-attacks are already affecting large institutions’ interest in and ability to create value from technology investment and innovation. Potential losses, both direct and indirect, reduce the expected economic benefits of technology investments, as do the high cost and lengthy time frame required to build the defense mechanisms that can protect the organisation against a growing range of attackers. In short, the models companies use to protect themselves from cyber-attack are limiting their ability to extract additional value from technology.\n\nConcern about cyber-attacks is already having a noticeable impact on business along three dimensions: lower frontline productivity, fewer resources for information technology (IT) initiatives that create value, and — critically — the slower implementation of technological innovations.",

This rock record provides clues about one of the most significant radiations (periods when existing life-forms gave rise to variations that would eventually evolve into entirely new species) in the history of marine invertebrates. During this radiation the number of marine biological families increased greatly, and these families included species that would dominate the marine ecosystems of the area for the next 215 million years. Although the radiation spanned tens of millions of years, major changes in many species occurred during a geologically short time span within the radiation and, furthermore, appear to have occurred worldwide, suggesting that external events were major factors in the radiation. And, in fact, there is evidence of major ecological and geological changes during this period: the sea level dropped drastically and mountain ranges were formed, in this instance, rather than leading to large-scale extinctions, these kinds of environmental changes may have resulted in an enriched pattern of habitats and nutrients, which in turn gave rise to the Ordovician radiation.

              "passage": "Nineteenth-century neurology was dominated by two opposing schools of thought. Early in the century Franz Gall claimed that the bumps on a person’s head revealed personality traits, each of which was controlled by a specific region of the brain. While this pseudoscience—phrenology—enjoyed a fashionable success, Gall was ridiculed by the leading neurologist of the 1840s, M. J. P. Flourens, who argued that the brain functioned as a whole, that individual bodily functions were not dependent on separate regions of the brain, and that it was impossible to predict the specific effects of any localized form of brain damage.\n\nIn 1861 the neuroanatomist Paul Broca challenged Flourens and the “holistic” school by demonstrating that damage to a specific region on the left side of the cerebral cortex caused severe language problems. Subsequently, the neurologist Carl Wernicke argued that the region discovered by Broca was somehow responsible for translating language formulated in the brain into the mechanical movements of the vocal cords, the tongue, and the mouth. Wernicke believed that a separate region he himself had discovered was responsible for the recognition of speech as distinct from other sounds. Clinicians soon found that such “localization” of brain functions explained neurological disorders in addition to language disorders. In 1884, for example, a patient with partial paralysis had a brain tumor removed in the first such operation in medical history. The neurological symptoms enabled the surgeon to locate the exact position of the tumor.\n\nAlthough this “localization” approach was largely dismissed by scientists between the 1920s and the 1950s, the research performed by the neurologist Norman Geschwind seems to have vindicated the theories of Broca and Wernicke. Beginning in 1965, Geschwind persuasively argued that in human beings, sensory information is initially processed in primary sensory areas of the brain, then relayed to neighboring regions known as association areas, where powerful associations are made between visual and auditory sensations, auditory and tactile, tactile and visual, and so forth. Damage to association areas could, according to Geschwind, explain why some brain-damaged patients can, for example, see previously familiar objects without recognizing them, but, upon touching the same objects, name them without difficulty.",

One study demonstrated, for example, that most minor bacterial infections will resolve without treatment within 5 to 14 days of onset of symptoms; a course of antibiotics might reduce that time frame by only 1 to 2 days. A second study indicated that the incidence of “superbugs,” which have resistance to a wide variety of antibacterial agents, is increasing significantly and that these bugs are more likely to spread among those who have been treated with antibiotics within the past 5 years. In particular, researchers have become alarmed by NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase), which is not a single bacterial species, but a multiple-antibiotic-resistant enzyme capable of infecting other strains of bacteria.\n\nIt is true that the proliferation of superbugs likely owes a great deal to the mistaken prescription of antibacterial treatment for viral infections, against which such treatment is ineffective, and to the routine addition of antibiotics to livestock feed in order to increase meat yields. Additionally, it is possible that ongoing research into the means by which resistance spreads among bacterial communities may lead to a new generation of antibiotics to which bacteria are unable to develop resistance. Yet these factors do not change the need for individual physicians to be more circumspect about drug therapy when treating cases of true bacterial infection.",

              "passage": "In choosing a method for determining climatic conditions that existed in the past, paleoclimatologists invoke four principal criteria. First, the material—rocks, lakes, vegetation, etc.—on which the method relies must be widespread enough to provide plenty of information, since analysis of material that is rarely encountered will not permit correlation with other regions or with other periods of geological history. Second, in the process of formation, the material must have received an environmental signal that reflects a change in climate and that can be deciphered by modern physical or chemical means. Third, at least some of the material must have retained the signal unaffected by subsequent changes in the environment. Fourth, it must be possible to determine the time at which the inferred climatic conditions held. This last criterion is more easily met in dating marine sediments, because dating of only a small number of layers in a marine sequence allows the age of other layers to be estimated fairly reliably by extrapolation and interpolation. By contrast, because sedimentation is much less continuous in continental regions, estimating the age of a continental bed from the known ages of beds above and below is more risky.\n\nOne very old method used in the investigation of past climatic conditions involves the measurement of water levels in ancient lakes. In temperate regions, there are enough lakes for correlations between them to give us a reliable picture. In arid and semiarid regions, on the other hand, the small number of lakes and the great distances between them reduce the possibilities for correlation. Moreover, since lake levels are controlled by rates of evaporation as well as by precipitation, the interpretation of such levels is ambiguous. For instance, the fact that lake levels in the semiarid southwestern United States appear to have been higher during the last ice age than they are now was at one time attributed to increased precipitation. On the basis of snow-line elevations, however, it has been concluded that the climate then was not necessarily wetter than it is now, but rather that both summers and winters were cooler, resulting in reduced evaporation.\n\nAnother problematic method is to reconstruct former climates on the basis of pollen profiles. The type of vegetation in a specific region is determined by identifying and counting the various pollen grains found there. Although the relationship between vegetation and climate is not as direct as the relationship between climate and lake levels, the method often works well in the temperate zones. In arid and semiarid regions in which there is not much vegetation, however, small changes in one or a few plant types can change the picture dramatically, making accurate correlations between neighboring areas difficult to obtain.",

              "passage": "The belief that friendly sociopolitical climates and low costs of government may be important (to competition among states to attract, keep, and enlarge high tech and manufacturing resources) has been reinforced by anecdotal evidence from business publications and business lobbyists who threaten to shift resources among states in response to costs or inconveniences imposed by state governments. Imbedded within the larger question of whether state policy initiatives affect the interstate movement of developmental resources is the more specific question of whether state-imposed environmental costs affect the interstate allocation of these resources. Do the actual or anticipated costs of complying with expensive environmental regulations in some states encourage producers to shift resources to other states? Extant evidence is mixed.\n\nOne set of scholars argues that interstate competition for economic development initiates a process analogous to Gresham's Law in which low regulatory costs in one state 'drive out' higher costs in competing states because states that impose higher marginal costs of government will lose in the competition for economic resources. Empirical tests of the Gresham's Law analogy have produced inconsistent results; however, recent research suggests that, while they have by no means supplanted traditional locational factors, these environmental costs-of-government are increasingly important determinants of plant location, especially of intraregional location choices among states with comparable extra-governmental characteristics.\n\nOthers argue that the environmental costs of government, like other costs of government, remain a trivial factor in industries' resource allocation decisions. Christopher Duerkson's extensive study for the Conservation Foundation (1981) found little effect of state regulation on plant siting decisions, corroborating Healy's finding two years earlier that environmental regulation had an insignificant impact on the location of industry. Moreover, industry publications have consistently ranked environmental regulation as one of the least important elements of 'business climate' influences on location decisions.\n\nWhat is one to make of this contradictory evidence? To some degree it reflects inherent research design difficulties. Multicollinearity, for example, makes it extremely difficult to distinguish the attractiveness of environmental regulation from other aspects of 'business climate.' Likewise, the concentration of energy and other natural resources in states with relatively low costs of government make it difficult to distinguish the effects of these two potential influences. But the inherent design difficulties should not obscure the possibility that both sets of evidence are partially correct with the weight of evidence leaning towards Healy and Duerkson.",

              "passage": "Aided by the recent ability to analyze samples of air trapped in glaciers, scientists now have a clearer idea of the relationship between atmospheric composition and global temperature change over the past 160,000 years. In particular, determination of atmospheric composition during periods of glacial expansion and retreat (cooling and warming) is possible using data from the 2,000 meter Vostok ice core drilled in Antarctica. The technique involved is similar to that used in analyzing cores of marine sediments, where the ratio of the two common isotopes of oxygen, 18O and 16O, accurately reflects past temperature changes. Isotopic analysis of oxygen in the Vostok core suggests mean global temperature fluctuations of up to 10 degrees centigrade over the past 160,000 years.\n\nData from the Vostok core also indicate that the amount of carbon dioxide has fluctuated with temperature over the same period: the higher the temperature, the higher the concentration of carbon dioxide and the lower the temperature, the lower the concentration. Although change in carbon dioxide content closely follows change in temperature during periods of deglaciation, it apparently lags behind temperature during periods of cooling. The correlation of carbon dioxide with temperature, of course, does not establish whether changes in atmospheric composition caused the warming and cooling trends or were caused by their.\n\nThe correlation between carbon dioxide and temperature throughout the Vostok record is consistent and predictable. The absolute temperature changes, however, are from 5 to 14 times greater than would be expected on the basis of carbon dioxide’s own ability to absorb infrared radiation, or radiant heat. This reaction suggests that, quite aside from changes in heat-trapping gases, commonly known as greenhouse gases, certain positive feedbacks are also amplifying the temperature change. Such feedbacks might involve ice on land and sea, clouds, or water vapor, which also absorb radiant heat.\n\nOther data from the Vostok core show that methane gas also correlates closely with temperature and carbon dioxide. The methane concentration nearly doubled, for example, between the peak of the penultimate glacial period and the following interglacial period. Within the present interglacial period it has more than doubled in just the past 300 years and is rising rapidly. Although the concentration of atmospheric methane is more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of carbon dioxide, it cannot be ignored: the radiative properties of methane make it 20 times more effective, molecule for molecule, than carbon dioxide in absorbing radiant heat. On the basis of a simulation model that climatological researchers have developed, methane appears to have been about 25 percent as important as carbon dioxide in the warming that took place during the most recent glacial retreat 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.",

Some geologists wondered whether the absence of friction-generated heat could be explained by the kinds of rock composing the fault. Geologists’ pre-1965 assumptions concerning heat generated in the fault were based on calculations about common varieties of rocks, such as limestone and granite; but “weaker” materials, such as clays, had already been identified in samples retrieved from the fault zone. Under normal conditions, rocks composed of clay produce far less friction than do other rock types.\n\nIn 1992 Byerlee tested whether these materials would produce friction 10 to 15 kilometers below the Earth’s surface. Byerlee found that when clay samples were subjected to the thousands of atmospheres of pressure they would encounter deep inside the Earth, they produced as much friction as was produced by other rock types. The harder rocks push against each other, the hotter they become; in other words, pressure itself, not only the rocks’ properties, affects frictional heating. Geologists therefore wondered whether the friction between the plates was being reduced by pockets of pressurized water within the fault that push the plates away from each other.",

She wished to discard the traditional methods and established vocabularies of such dance forms as ballet and to explore the internal sources of human expressiveness. She shunned bodily ornamentation and strove to use only the natural movements of her body, undistorted by acrobatic exaggeration and stimulated only by internal compulsion. In her recitals, Duncan danced to the music of Beethoven, Wagner, and Gluck, among others, but, contrary to popular belief, she made no attempt to visualize or to interpret the music; rather, she simply relied on it to provide the inspiration for expressing inner feelings through movement. She did not regard this use of music as ideal, however, believing that she would someday dispense with music entirely. That day never came.",

              "passage": "Long regarded as a necessary evil, the royal mistress is a classic staple of the French court. It was hardly a new trick for a monarch to use mistresses and political advisors as scapegoats, but the Bourbons did it with their own particular flare and brand of ceremony. Much of life in the French court was dictated by tradition, ritual, and custom, and the role of the mistress was no exception to this. Mistresses were there to please the king and be the target for unwanted criticism, but they were also expected to stay out of political affairs.\n\nThis, of course, was hardly ever the case. The mistresses of Louis XIV, however, were rather well behaved in comparison to those of the future kings. Louis XIV fathered 13 illegitimate children with his mistresses over the course of his life. Thus, his many mistresses were often more concerned with securing rights for their illegitimate offspring than with meddling in affairs of the state. This lack of political meddling made them somewhat less prone to the tremendously harsh scrutiny faced later by those of Louis XV. Additionally, Louis XIV’s absolutist rule certainly had much to do with his mistresses remaining in their “proper places.” Furthermore, Louis’ strict control of the presses kept much of the harshest criticism at bay.\n\nNevertheless, there was still a steady stream of underground literature and cartoons that demonstrated abhorrence for many of Louis’ paramours. What was important about the criticism that did proliferate against his mistresses, however, was that it was used to great advantage by Louis XIV. Indeed, he used it to deflect criticism off of himself. By having an easily disposable female to shoulder the blame for various monarchical mishaps, Louis was able to retain his appearance of absolute control and otherworldly perfection.\n\nThere would, however, be consequences for such skillful puppet-mastery in the coming century. Louis XIV was the singular architect of a vast veil of fictive space inlaid between him and his people, creating a dangerous precedent of masterful manipulation that could not be maintained to the same degree by later monarchs. It was clear that Louis XIV crafted this fictive space cleverly and with great skill, peppering it with self-promoting propaganda to control his image in the collective imagination of his people. His progeny, however, were simply not as adept at doing so. Even more problematic, although future monarchs were not able to dexterously manipulate this fictive space themselves, it did not go away. Instead, it was the satirists, pamphleteers, and playwrights who took over its construction in the years leading up to the Revolution. In short, though it was Louis XIV who wrote his own mythology, Louis XVI would have his written for him.",

              "passage": "For years scholars have contrasted slavery in the United States and in Brazil, stimulated by the fact that racial patterns assumed such different aspects in the two countries after emancipation. Brazil never developed a system of rigid segregation of the sort that replaced slavery in the United States, and its racial system was fluid because its definition of race was based as much on characteristics such as economic status as on skin color. Until recently, the most persuasive explanation for these differences was that Portuguese institutions especially the Roman Catholic church and Roman civil law, promoted recognition of the slave’s humanity. The English colonists, on the other hand, constructed their system of slavery out of whole cloth. There were simply no precedents in English common law, and separation of church and state barred Protestant clergy from the role that priests assumed in Brazil.\n\nBut the assumption that institutions alone could so powerfully affect the history of two raw and malleable frontier countries seems, on reexamination, untenable. Recent studies focus instead on a particular set of contrasting economic circumstances and demographic profiles at significant periods in the histories of the two countries. Persons of mixed race quickly appeared in both countries. In the United States they were considered to be Black, a social definition that was feasible because they were in the minority. In Brazil, it was not feasible. Though intermarriage was illegal in both countries, the laws were unenforceable in Brazil since Whites formed a small minority in an overwhelmingly Black population. Manumission for persons of mixed race was also easier in Brazil, particularly in the nineteenth century when in the United States it was hedged about with difficulties. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled workers in Brazil provided persons of mixed race with the opportunity to learn crafts and trades, even before general emancipation, whereas in the United States entry into these occupations was blocked by Whites sufficiently numerous to fill the posts. The consequence was the development in Brazil of a large class of persons of mixed race, proficient in skilled trades and crafts, who stood waiting as a community for freed slaves to join.\n\nThere should be no illusion that Brazilian society after emancipation was color-blind. Rather, the large population of persons of mixed race produced a racial system that included a third status, a bridge between the Black caste and the White, which could be traversed by means of economic or intellectual achievement, marriage, or racial heritage. The strict and sharp line between the races so characteristic of the United States in the years immediately after emancipation was simply absent. With the possible exception of New Orleans, no special “place” developed in the United States for persons of mixed race. Sad to say, every pressure of society worked to prevent their attaining anything approximating the economic and social position available to their counterparts in Brazil.",

              "passage": "Jeffrey C. Goldfarb suggests public-spirited dialog need not happen after a traditional theater show, as it is most successful when it happens through a show. He believes that the live component of the theater distinguishes it from other media objects, and allows meaning to arise from the interaction between performers and audience as the performance is happening. Whereas television or film, for instance, has no room for active dialogue, theater does because the performers and audience are present in the space together. The theatrical text becomes the medium, and the performers speak through the way in which they perform the text, while the audience does so through a number of culturally sanctioned actions: applause, laughter (both laughing with and laughing at), sighing, gasping, cheering, and booing. Goldfarb recounts a particular occurrence surrounding a production of Dziady (Forefather’s Eve) in Poland in 1968. The show had been ordered to close and, on its last night, the theater was overcrowded with supporters. They were an enthusiastic, vocal audience who entered into “dialogue” with the actors and read into the play’s anticzarist language a critique of Soviet government. When the performance ended, the crowd went into the streets to protest. The play’s content became political through dialogue and, in a way, the theater building held a public sphere where an anti-Soviet public gathered to affirm their political sentiment before taking it to the street in open, public protest.\n\nWhat Goldfarb does not write about is how uncommon such an event is, especially for today’s American theatergoers. Augusto Boal was probably closer to the reality of current Western theater when he complained about how still everyone is expected to keep during any performance, constantly policed by other audience members. The high prices on professional theater tickets and an elitist value on cultural tradition (versus popular, technology-based mass media) combine to produce an aristocratic culture surrounding theater. In this manner, a “high class” code of etiquette is imposed upon the performance space, dictating that audience members are to remain quiet: the actors speak, the audience listens. As Boal criticizes in Legislative Theatre, traditional form sets up a relationship where “everything travels from stage to auditorium, everything is transported, transferred in that direction — emotions, ideas, morality! — and nothing goes the other way.” He argues that this relationship encourages passivity and thus cancels theater’s political potential.",
