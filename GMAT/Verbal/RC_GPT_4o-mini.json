However, it does not directly relate to the Spinozan hypothesis.\n   - **D**: \"more likely to believe them than when he is alert and mentally fresh\" - This option aligns with the Spinozan hypothesis, which states that the default is to believe understandable propositions.

This implies that we need to consider how belief is formed based on the theories presented in the passage.\n\n### Step 2: Identify key information\nThe passage discusses two hypotheses about belief:\n- **Cartesian Hypothesis**: Belief comes after comprehension and requires rational assessment.\n- **Spinozan Hypothesis**: Comprehension and belief occur together automatically, with disbelief requiring effortful assessment.\n\nThe passage also notes that people tend to accept and believe most of what they see, hear, and read effortlessly, which suggests that advertisers should leverage this tendency.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate each option\nA: **Convey the message only using words familiar to the target customers.**\n- This aligns with the idea that understandable propositions are more likely to be accepted. Familiar words would facilitate comprehension and thus belief.\n\nB: **Convey the message using the traditional motifs of the target customers.**\n- While this could resonate with the audience, it doesn't directly address the comprehension-belief link as strongly as option A.\n\nC: **Not use any negative words in his message.**\n- Negative words could create doubt, but the passage emphasizes that belief is easier than disbelief.

It also mentions that when targets are based on three to five metrics that are not closely correlated, CEOs are equally likely to meet or miss those targets.

This means we need to identify statements that are either contradicted by the passage or not addressed at all.\n\n2. **Identify key information**: The passage discusses the issues with CEO performance targets, the manipulation of those targets, and how compensation structures can lead to suboptimal company performance. Key themes include:\n   - Short-term interests of CEOs vs. long-term company value.\n   - The manipulation of performance metrics.\n   - The impact of performance targets on CEO behavior.\n   - The structure of rewards and how they influence CEO motivation.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A**: \"The performance targets of most CEOs are not aligned to their company's mission and values.\" The passage implies that performance targets can be manipulated and do not promote long-term growth, which suggests a misalignment with the company's mission. This statement is supported.\n   - **B**: \"If the bonus of a CEO depends only on the earnings per share of his company, then he is likely to make a strategic choice that improves earnings per share even if it hurts revenue growth.\" The passage explicitly discusses how focusing on a single metric like earnings per share can lead to detrimental decisions, supporting this statement.\n   - **C**: \"Most CEOs strive hard to hit the performance targets that are linked to their compensation.\" The passage suggests that CEOs often meet targets but does not imply that they strive hard for exceptional performance, especially since the structure of rewards does not incentivize it. This statement is not strongly supported.\n   - **D**: \"The boards of most companies fail to set multiple performance targets for their CEOs.\" The passage indicates that boards often set performance targets based on single metrics, suggesting a failure to implement multiple targets. This statement is supported.\n   - **E**: \"In most companies, CEO rewards for performance do not increase at a steady rate.\" The passage describes how rewards rise steeply until a target is reached and then taper off, indicating that the increase is not steady. This statement is supported.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: Options A, B, D, and E are all supported by the passage. Option C stands out because while it mentions that CEOs strive to meet targets, the passage implies that the structure of rewards does not encourage striving for exceptional performance.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The statement that is least supported by the passage is C.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

This suggests a change in the nature of labor relations following the shift from state ownership to privatization.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: an inevitable problem in a weak national economy**: This option implies that labor disruptions are a natural consequence of a weak economy. The passage does not suggest that labor disruptions are inevitable or directly linked to the economy's strength.\n   - **B: a positive sign of employee concern about a company**: This option suggests that labor disruptions indicate employee concern, which is not supported by the passage. The author does not frame labor disruptions positively.\n   - **C: a predictor of employee reactions to a company’s offer to sell shares to them**: The passage does not discuss labor disruptions as predictors of employee reactions to share offers; it focuses more on the outcomes of privatization.\n   - **D: a phenomenon found more often in state-owned industries than in private companies**: This option aligns with the passage, which indicates that labor disruptions were common in state-owned industries but have decreased significantly after privatization.\n   - **E: a deterrence to high performance levels in an industry**: While the passage implies that labor disruptions negatively impact performance, it does not directly state that they are a deterrent to high performance levels.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: Options D and E are the most relevant to the context of labor disruptions. However, D specifically addresses the comparison between state-owned and private companies, which is a central theme of the passage.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The author clearly suggests that labor disruptions were more prevalent in state-owned industries and have been reduced in privatized companies, making option D the most appropriate inference.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

It also mentions Thomas Paine's idea about ownership and the importance of individuals making their own decisions to invest.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: It depends to a potentially dangerous degree on individual ownership of shares**: This option suggests a negative implication about the reliance on individual ownership. The passage does not indicate that this reliance is dangerous; rather, it emphasizes the positive effects of individual ownership.\n   - **B: It conforms in its most general outlines to Thomas Paine’s prescription for business ownership**: The passage references Thomas Paine's idea about ownership but does not explicitly state that the privatization process conforms to his prescription. It suggests that ownership should involve personal investment, which aligns with Paine's views, but it does not confirm conformity.\n   - **C: It was originally conceived to include some giving away of free shares**: The passage mentions that some economists suggested giving away free shares to accelerate privatization, but it does not state that this was part of the original conception of the process.\n   - **D: It has been successful, even though privatization has failed in other countries**: The passage describes the success of privatization in the UK but does not compare it to other countries or state that it has failed elsewhere.\n   - **E: It is taking place more slowly than some economists suggest is necessary**: The passage does not provide information about the speed of the privatization process relative to economists' suggestions.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: Options A, C, D, and E do not have sufficient support from the passage.

We need to analyze the three statements (I, II, III) to determine which ones are valid assumptions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify key information\n- The passage discusses the distinction between society and government, the origins of government, and the necessity of government for protection.\n- The essential purpose of government, according to the author, is to provide freedom and security, particularly in protecting property.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate each option\n- **I.** There actually existed a time in which the disparity between an individual‘s needs and wants motivated cooperation, and not transgressions against property.\n  - This statement suggests that in the early state of nature, cooperation was driven by needs rather than property conflicts. The author implies that government arose from the need to protect property, so this assumption seems valid.\n\n- **II.** The part of property surrendered to establish some form of government is less than that which would be lost if it were left unprotected.\n  - This statement is a direct assumption of the author's conclusion. If the government is to protect property, it must be assumed that the cost of establishing it (surrendering some property) is less than the potential loss without it. This assumption is also valid.\n\n- **III.** The moral laxity resulting from reduction in hardship results in acts against property, rather than failure to assist those experiencing disease or misfortune.\n  - This statement implies that moral laxity leads to property transgressions rather than a failure to help others. The passage suggests that as society becomes more comfortable, individuals may neglect their duties to each other, which could lead to property issues. This assumption aligns with the author's argument.\n\n### Step 4: Compare best choices\n- All three statements (I, II, and III) are valid assumptions that support the author's conclusion about the essential purpose of government being the protection of property.\n- Therefore, the answer must include all three statements.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude\nSince all three assumptions support the author's conclusion, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: A",

Therefore, we cannot definitively answer who Doran thinks is the best based on the text.\n   - **Statement II**: The passage indicates that Garrick is not presented with a distinct figure and suggests some ambiguity in Doran's thoughts about him. It states, \"Garrick himself... bears no very distinct figure,\" implying that Doran's opinion is not clear or strong. Thus, we cannot definitively answer what Doran thought of Garrick.\n   - **Statement III**: The author suggests that there is doubt regarding the first question posed in the passage, which implies that a definite answer is not given. The phrase \"do not relieve one of the doubt\" indicates that the author would not provide a clear answer to the question about the greatest actor.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: \n   - Since neither I nor II can be definitively answered based on the passage, and III suggests that the author would not provide a definite answer to the first question, the only statement that can be confidently concluded is III.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The only statement that can be answered based on the passage is III.

This means we need to find an option that challenges the idea that readers can bridge the gap between themselves and the author through understanding and interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Information\n- Woolf believes that interpretation can close the gap between reader and writer.\n- The question is looking for something that would weaken this belief.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n**A: Contemporary writers are unable to construct a deep meaning for each reader because they focus primarily on personal distinctions rather than similarities.**\n- This suggests that contemporary writers' focus on personal distinctions prevents a shared understanding, which would weaken Woolf's assertion. This option is plausible.\n\n**B: Every reader reacts differently to the same text and yet each constructs for himself/herself a similar idea of the author‘s personality and presence.**\n- This implies that despite individual reactions, readers can still find a common understanding of the author, which supports Woolf's assertion rather than weakening it.\n\n**C: Past writers were governed by a strong sense of individualism, which made it impossible for them to appeal to human commonalities.**\n- This suggests that individualism in past writers hinders universal appeal, but it doesn't directly weaken Woolf's assertion about interpretation bridging gaps.\n\n**D: Authorial intent or perspective remains an abstract idea unless the writer is able to confirm or deny the reader‘s interpretation.**\n- This implies that without confirmation from the author, interpretation is limited, which could weaken Woolf's assertion about bridging the gap through interpretation.\n\n**E: Most readers are not learned enough to be able to understand the deeper meaning that is implied by the author.**\n- This suggests that a lack of understanding among readers limits their ability to interpret the text, which would weaken Woolf's assertion.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Best Choices\nOptions A, D, and E all present arguments that could weaken Woolf's assertion. However, A focuses on contemporary writers and their inability to create deep meaning, which directly addresses the current state of writing and interpretation. D points to the abstract nature of authorial intent, which could weaken the interpretive process. E suggests a lack of reader capability, which also weakens the assertion.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude\nAmong these, option A stands out as it directly addresses the contemporary context of writing and interpretation, suggesting that the focus on personal distinctions prevents a shared understanding. This aligns closely with Woolf's concerns about modern writers and the barriers they face. \n\nFinal Answer: A",

The passage supports this by discussing Woolf's exploration of Turgenev's methods and the question of authorial intent, so this statement is characteristic of her essays.\n   - **B**: This option claims that her essays are more technically and thematically complex than her fictional works. The passage suggests that her essays reveal a complexity that rivals her novels, which supports this statement.\n   - **C**: This option indicates that her essays show skepticism about the idea of closing the gap between author and audience. The passage notes Woolf's awareness of barriers and her assertion that the journey to understanding the self is impossible for modern writers, which aligns with this skepticism.\n   - **D**: This option states that her essays frequently use examples from other writers to support her conclusions.

The passage suggests that a lack of willingness to scale down demands can lead to inflationary pressures and a lack of social consensus, but it does not explicitly state that this unwillingness \"prevents\" social consensus.\n   \n   - **C: People's acceptance of lower real income growth can prevent inflation.**  \n     This is not directly supported by the passage. While the passage discusses how acceptance of lower growth can lead to a more stable economic environment, it does not claim that this acceptance prevents inflation outright.\n   \n   - **D: Reliable indicators of social consciousness exist.**  \n     The passage mentions that researchers examined the experience of eighteen industrial countries and found differences in inflation performances explained by social consciousness, but it does not confirm that reliable indicators exist.\n   \n   - **E: Workers are generally resistant to reduction in the level or growth rate of real wage.**  \n     This option aligns well with the passage. It discusses how workers' resistance to wage reductions is linked to the lack of social consensus and trust.

While it shows a positive outcome, it does not involve a feedback loop that enhances the original action (visiting the park).\n   - **C**: This scenario shows that increasing capacity to meet demand leads to improved service, prompting even more demand (more smartphone purchases). This reflects a virtuous cycle where the initial improvement leads to further positive outcomes.\n   - **D**: This option describes a scenario where creating jobs leads to better education, which attracts more companies. This is a positive feedback loop, but it is less direct than option C regarding the initial action leading to a specific improvement that encourages further action.\n   - **E**: This scenario depicts a negative outcome where a fee leads to account closures and switching banks.

It only mentions that cities like London and Singapore have implemented congestion pricing. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed and is not supported by the passage.\n   \n   - **C: Congestion pricing is the best solution available to developing countries facing traffic problems.**\n     - While the passage advocates for congestion pricing as a solution, it does not claim it is the \"best\" solution, nor does it compare it to other potential solutions. Therefore, this statement is too strong and not directly supported.\n   \n   - **D: Cities that have implemented congestion pricing have generally been successful at reducing traffic.**\n     - The passage provides evidence that cities like London and Singapore have successfully reduced traffic congestion and improved commuting times after implementing congestion pricing.

It emphasizes the potential for a unified science of sociobiology based on these similarities, despite initial perceptions of significant structural differences.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A**: This option suggests that oversimplified comparisons could diminish the likelihood of developing a unified science. This contradicts the author's view, which supports the idea that such comparisons can lead to a general theory.\n   - **B**: This option implies that understanding the similarities requires training in both biology and sociology. While the author discusses similarities, they do not emphasize the need for dual training.\n   - **C**: This option states that most animals exhibit group behavior patterns similar to human societies. The passage does not focus on human societies but rather on the specific comparison between termites and macaques.\n   - **D**: This option asserts that termites and macaques follow similar and predictable patterns of behavior. While this is true, it does not capture the broader implication of developing a unified science.\n   - **E**: This option states that studying the similarities between insect and vertebrate societies could provide the basis for a unified science of sociobiology. This aligns closely with the author's argument about the potential for a unified theory based on observed similarities.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: Options D and E both touch on the similarities between termites and macaques. However, D focuses on behavior patterns without mentioning the broader scientific implications, while E directly addresses the potential for a unified science, which is the main point of the passage.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The best summary of the author's main point is found in option E, as it encapsulates the idea that studying the similarities could lead to a unified science of sociobiology.\n\nFinal Answer: E",

The author notes functional similarities between insect and vertebrate societies, despite initial impressions of structural differences. The author expresses a sense of increasing appreciation for these similarities as their studies advance, suggesting a thoughtful consideration of the topic.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: Guarded optimism** - This implies a cautious but hopeful view. The author acknowledges the potential for a unified theory while also recognizing the challenges involved.\n   - **B: Unqualified enthusiasm** - This suggests an outright, uncritical excitement about the possibility of a unified theory. The passage does not convey this level of enthusiasm.\n   - **C: Objective indifference** - This would mean the author is neutral and does not care about the possibility. The author's engagement with the topic suggests they are not indifferent.\n   - **D: Resignation** - This implies giving up or accepting that a unified theory is unlikely. The author does not express this attitude.\n   - **E: Dissatisfaction** - This suggests a negative feeling about the current state of sociobiology. The author does not express dissatisfaction but rather a thoughtful consideration of the topic.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: The most fitting option is A (guarded optimism) because the author shows a thoughtful appreciation for the similarities between the two groups and suggests that a general theory could emerge, albeit with some caution regarding the complexity of the task. The author does not express outright enthusiasm or indifference, nor do they show resignation or dissatisfaction.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The author’s attitude is best captured by \"guarded optimism,\" as they recognize the potential for a unified theory while also acknowledging the complexities involved.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

This requires us to identify the main points made in the passage about the similarities and differences between these two types of societies.\n\n2. **Identify key information**: The passage emphasizes functional similarities between insect and vertebrate societies, such as cooperative group formation, division of labor, and communication. The author also mentions that while there are structural differences, these are less significant than the functional similarities.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A**: A distinguishing characteristic of most insect and vertebrate societies is a well-marked division of labor.  \n     - This aligns with the passage, which states that both societies have a division of labor.\n   \n   - **B**: The caste structure of insect societies is similar to that of vertebrate societies.  \n     - The passage does not specifically mention caste structures in vertebrate societies, so this option is not supported.\n\n   - **C**: Most insect and vertebrate societies form cooperative groups in order to occupy territory.  \n     - While the passage mentions cooperative groups and territory, it does not explicitly state that the primary purpose of forming these groups is to occupy territory. This is an assumption beyond what the text provides.\n\n   - **D**: The means of communication among members of insect societies is similar to that among members of vertebrate societies.  \n     - The passage does mention that both groups communicate various statuses, which supports this option.\n\n   - **E**: There are significant structural differences between insect and vertebrate societies.  \n     - The author suggests that while structural differences exist, they are less significant than the functional similarities, which contradicts this option.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: Options A and D both reflect points made in the passage. However, A focuses on the division of labor, which is explicitly stated as a characteristic of both societies, while D discusses communication, which is also mentioned but may not be as central to the author's argument about unifying sociobiology.\n\n5. **Conclude**: Given the emphasis on the division of labor as a distinguishing characteristic, option A is the most appropriate answer.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

It mentions direct and indirect losses, the costs and time required for cybersecurity, and how a reactive approach to cybersecurity limits value extraction from technology.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: experiencing stolen intellectual property**: This is a direct loss and would decrease economic benefits, as the passage states that investing in a new system is a bet against the theft of intellectual property.\n   - **B: realising indirect losses**: The passage mentions that potential losses, both direct and indirect, reduce expected economic benefits. This option decreases economic benefits.\n   - **C: weighing business outcomes and risks**: This option suggests a thoughtful approach to investment, which could lead to better decision-making. It does not inherently decrease economic benefits; rather, it could help mitigate risks.\n   - **D: investing in cybersecurity protection technology**: While this involves costs, the passage implies that investing in cybersecurity is a necessary measure to protect against losses. It doesn’t directly decrease economic benefits but instead aims to protect them.\n   - **E: reacting to cyber-threats only when necessary**: This reactive approach is criticized in the passage as limiting the ability to extract value from technology, suggesting it does decrease economic benefits.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: Options A, B, E clearly decrease economic benefits. Options C and D do not fit this pattern. C could potentially enhance economic benefits by improving decision-making, and D is a protective measure rather than a direct detractor.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The option that does NOT decrease the economic benefits of technological investment is C, as weighing business outcomes and risks can lead to better investments and outcomes.\n\nFinal Answer: C",
