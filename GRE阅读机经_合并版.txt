Passage 1
Although social learning (the acquisition of specific behaviors by observing other individuals 
exhibiting those behaviors ) is well documented among fish, few studies have investigated 
social learning within a developmental context in these taxa. Rather than investigating the 
development of a particular skill, Chapman, Ward, and Krause investigated the role of group 
density during development in later foraging success in laboratory-housed guppies. When 
raised with a small number of conspecifics (members of the same species), guppies were 
quicker to locate food by following a trained adult guppy than were guppies raised in large 
groups. This counterintuitive finding is explained by the fact that guppies reared in the high-
density condition were less likely to shoal (swim in a group ) with others and, therefore, were 
less likely to learn the benefits of social learning. Instead, fish reared in high-density situations 
may learn that conspecifics are to be viewed as competitors, rather than as potential sources 
of adaptive information. This finding suggests that at least for guppies, the early social 
environment may have an effect on the capacity for social learning, if not on the socially 
learned behaviors themselves.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. note a flaw in a scientific finding
B. describe a particular scientific study
C. present an interpretation of a finding
D. note a difference between two scientific findings
E. contrast two conditions in which a particular phenomenon has been observed
2. Regarding research on fish, it can be inferred from the passage that
A. research studies of the acquisition of important skills by fish have only recently begun to
document the role of conspecifics in the learning process
B. research on social learning in guppies suggests that guppies differ in important ways from
most other fish in the means by which they learn particular skills
C. research on social learning in fish has generally focused on the acquisition of skills other
than foraging
D. research has established that social learning occurs in some fish species without
investigating the development context in which it occurs.
E. research to investigate social learning has been done more extensively on fish than on
other aquatic animals.
3. Which of the following can be inferred about the study by Chapman, Ward, and Krause?
A. It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning.
B. It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life spans.
C. It pointed to the possibility that population density may have little to do with guppies’ social
learning.
D. It required the observation of guppies under conditions that closely mimicked the conditions
of guppies in the wild.
E. It indicated that guppies gain adaptive information from being reared with a relatively large
number of conspecifics.

 Passage 2
As it was published in 1935, Mules and Men, Zora Neale Hurston's landmark collection of 
folktales, may not have been the book that its author first had in mind. In this anthropological 
study, Hurston describes in detail the people who tell the stories, often even inserting herself 
into the storytelling scene. Evidently, however, Hurston had prepared another version, a 
manuscript that was recently discovered and published after having been forgotten since 
1929. This version differs from Mules and Men in that it simply records stories, with no 
descriptive or interpretive information.
While we cannot know for certain why Hurston’s original manuscript went unpublished during 
her lifetime, it may have been because publishers wanted something more than a transcription 
of tales. Contemporary novelist and critic John Edgar Wideman has described Black literature 
as the history of a writing that sought to escape its frame, in other words, as the effort of Black 
writers to present the stories of Black people without having to have a mediating voice to 
explain the stories to a non-Black audience. In this, Hurston may have been ahead of her time. 
1. Select the sentence that suggests a possible reason why Hurston wrote the version of
Mules and Men that was published in 1935.
2. The passage suggests that Hurston may have done which of the following in preparing her
original version?
A. Discussed her mode of presentation with her publisher before writing the first draft, in order
to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding.
B. Shortened her presentation of the stories to the bare minimum in order to be able to present
more folklore material.
C. Put it aside for several decades in order to maximize its potential audience when it was
published.
D. Reluctantly agreed to reshape it in order to take out various elements with which her
publisher had been dissatisfied.
E. Chose not to include editorial commentary, in order to present the stories on their own
terms.
Passage 3
A decrease in face-to-face social contact can precipitate depression. Time spent using the 
Internet cannot be spent in face-to-face social contact, so psychologists have speculated that 
sharply increasing Internet use can cause depression. Studies of regular Internet users have 
found a significantly higher incidence of depression among those who had recently doubled 
the amount of time they spent using the Internet than among those whose use had not 
increased. Hence, the psychologists’ speculation is correct. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A. In general, the reason that the people in the studies had doubled their Internet use was not
that they had earlier experienced a significant decrease in opportunities for face-to-face social
contact.
B. A sharp decrease in face-to-face social contact is the only change in daily activity that can
lead to an increased incidence of depression.
C. Using the Internet presents no opportunities for people to increase the amount of face-to-
face social contact they experienced in their daily lives.
D. Regular Internet users who are depressed will experience an immediate improvement in
mood if they sharply decrease the amount of time they spend on the Internet.
E. Before they doubled the time they spent on the Internet, the people who did so were
already more prone to depression than are regular Internet users in general.

 Passage 4
African American drama has, until recently, been rooted in the mimetic tradition of modern 
American naturalism. The most distinctive attribute of this tradition is the mechanistic, 
materialistic conception of humanity. Naturalism sees each individual as inextricably bound to 
the environment and depicts each person as someone controlled by, instead of controlling, 
concrete reality. As long as African American drama maintained naturalism as its dominant 
mode, it could only express the “plight of African American people”. Its heroes might declare 
the madness of reality, but reality inevitably triumphed over them. 
The surrealistic plays of Adrienne Kennedy mark one of the first departures from naturalism by 
an African American dramatist. The overall goal of her work has been to depict the world of the 
soul and the spirit, not to mirror concrete reality. Within this framework, Kennedy has been 
able to portray African American minds and souls liberated from their connections to the 
external environment. 
1. Which of the following best states the central idea of the passage?
A. African American drama has been primarily influenced by naturalisms emphasis on the
materialistic.
B. African American drama has traditionally acknowledged the relationship between the
individual and the environment.
C. African American drama, traditionally naturalistic, has been little influenced by dramatist
Kennedy’s spiritual and psychological approach to drama.
D. The work of Kennedy suggests a shift away from a commitment to strict naturalism in
African American drama.
E. The work of Kennedy best exemplifies the current interest of African American artists in the
spiritual and psychological worlds.
2. According to the passage, Kennedy is concerned with depicting the
A. internal rather than the external life of her characters
B. madness of reality rather than the effects of reality
C. effects of materialism on African American minds and souls
D. relationship between naturalism and the human spirit
E. effects that her characters have on the environment
3. Which of the following statements, if true, would most strengthen the authors assertion that
Kennedy’s work marks a serious departure from the tradition described in the first paragraph?
A. Kennedy places the action in a real-life setting that is nevertheless unfamiliar to the
average viewer or reader.
B. Kennedy movingly portrays the lives and struggles of prominent African Americans in the
United States.
C. Kennedy uses characters found only in ancient African legends and mythology.
D. Kennedy provides insights into American mimetic tradition and dramatic convention.
E. Kennedy depicts the events in a style reminiscent of a television documentary.

 Passage 5
Although many hypotheses have been proposed to explain why some plant communities are 
more susceptible than others to invasion by nonnative species, results from field studies have 
been inconsistent and no general theory of invasibility has yet emerged. However, a theory 
based on fluctuating resource availability could integrate most existing hypotheses and 
successfully resolve many of the apparently conflicting and ambiguous results of previous 
studies. The suggested theory is that a plant community becomes more susceptible to 
invasion whenever there is an increase in the amount of unused resources. 
The diversity in the range of resource-release mechanisms could partly explain the absence of 
consistent ecological correlates of invasibility. In particular, the theory predicts that there will 
be no necessary relationship between the species diversity of a plant community and its 
susceptibility to invasion, since near-complete exploitation can each occur in both species-rich 
and species-poor communities. Though Lonsdale found a positive association between 
species richness and invasion, this may arise from the tendency of diverse plant communities 
to be nutrient poor and therefore more responsive to the effects of human-caused influxes of 
nutrients. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. assessing the empirical success of a theory
B. explaining why no consistent theoretical account of a phenomenon has been possible
C. advocating a potential solution to a theoretical impasse
D. deducing testable predictions from a proposed theory
E. describing the difficulties involved in explaining certain empirical results
2. It can be inferred that the author would most likely agree with which of the following
assessments of the results from field studies
A. Many of the results contradicted predictions of susceptibility to invasion that are based on
the availability of resources unused by the community.
B. If fluctuating resource availability were taken into account, many of the apparent
inconsistencies among the results could be explained.
C. The apparent inconsistencies and ambiguities in the results are caused by trying to make
them fit an inadequate general theory of invasibility.
D. No general theory of invasibility has emerged because none of the studies has been able to
assess the degree of an invasion accurately.
E. The results tend to show a degree of susceptibility to invasion that is lower than would be
expected given the prevalence in the wild of nonnative species.
3. According to the author, the theory based on fluctuating resource availability might resolve
“apparently conflicting and ambiguous results” because
A. It explains how a particular circumstance can produce disparate effects.
B. It does not assume that all of the results are instances of the phenomenon that the theory is
intended to explain.
C. It predicts that seemingly minor variations in research methodology can have a dramatic
effect on results.
D. Its account is based on a statistical tendency rather than on the supposition that the results
arise from a causal connection.
E. It indicates why a similar outcome may be preceded by very different circumstances on
different occasions.
14


 Passage 6
Although some skeptics points to Arctic places such as the high latitudes of Greenland, where 
temperatures seem to have fallen, a recent scientific report concludes that in recent decades 
average temperatures have increased faster in the Arctic than elsewhere. Scientists have long 
suspected that several factors lead to greater temperature swings at Earths polar regions than 
elsewhere. First, most of the Arctic is covered in snow and ice, which are highly reflective; if 
snow and ice melt, the exposed soil, which absorbs heat, serves to accelerate warming. 
Second, the polar atmosphere is thin, so little energy is required to warm it. Third, less solar 
energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics. 
1. Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
The passage mentions which of the following as factors that might lead to large temperature
swings in Earths polar regions?
A. the amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles
B. soil exposure due to melting snow
C. the relatively thin atmosphere at the poles
2. In pointing to the apparent temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland, the
skeptics mentioned in the passage intend to raise as a question whether
A. Greenland is less likely to experience extreme temperature changes than are other areas of
the Arctic.
B. Those more localized temperature drops might indicate an important trend not captured by
the upward trend of average Arctic temperatures.
C. There might be a reversal of the temperature trend in the high latitudes of Greenland.
D. The factors that cause temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland are different
from those that affect the rest of the Arctic.
E. Greenland has more ice and snow on the ground than do other areas of the Arctic.
15


 Passage 7
Among many historians a belief persists that Cotton Mather’s biographies of some of the 
settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (published 1702) are exercises in hagiography, 
endowing their subjects with saintly piety at the expense of historical accuracy. Yet modern 
studies have profited both from the breadth of information that Mather provides in, for 
example, his discussions of colonial medicine and from his critical observations of such 
leading figures as Governor John Winthrop. Mather’s wry humor as demonstrated by his 
detailed descriptions of events such as Winthrop’s efforts to prevent wood-stealing is 
overlooked by those charging Mather with presenting his subjects as extremely pious. The 
charge also obscures Mather’s concern with the settlers material, not just spiritual, prosperity. 
Further, this pejorative view underrates the biographies value as chronicles: Mather amassed 
all sorts of published and unpublished documents as sources, and his selection of key events 
shows a marked sensitivity to the nature of the colony’s development. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. argue against a theory universally accepted by historical researchers
B. call attention to an unusual approach to documenting a historical era
C. summarize research on a specific historical figure
D. counter a particular view about the work of a biographer
E. point out subtle differences among controversial historical reports
2. The author of the passage implies that an argument for the historical accuracy of Mather’s
works is most strongly supported by which of the following?
A. surviving documents that corroborate Mather’s detailed descriptions of his subjects
B. Mather’s firsthand personal acquaintance with those about whom he wrote
C. Mather’s frank and straightforward accounts of the lives and times of people about whom
he had conducted extensive research
D. Mather’s ability to detail important historical events in the religious context of which they
were a part
E. the quantity and nature of the sources from which Mather obtained his information.
3. Information in the passage best supports which of the following statements about Mather’s
biographies of the settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony?
A. Annals written by Mather and others were censored by later historians, thus detracting from
their value as full and accurate accounts of the period.
B. Mather’s description of Governor Winthrop includes all of Winthrop’s shortcomings, such as
a tendency toward levity at inappropriate times.
C. Mather’s descriptions of the Massachusetts Bay colonists were based primarily on firsthand
experiences.
D. Many historians believe that Mather’s biographies are poor sources of historical information
because biography is an inherently unreliable genre of historical writing.
E. Mather’s writings reflect an interest in the degree of economic success achieved by early
Massachusetts Bay colonists.
4. It can be inferred from the passage that many historians believe that Mather’s biographies
primarily
A. disclose important historical data from the settlers’ private diaries
B. glorify the early colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony
C. provide a fuller picture of the multifaceted characters of such historical ﬁgures as John Winthrop
D. indicate the salutary effects of the settlers’ religious practices on colonial life
E. reveal that the settlers considered their lives to be similar to those of the saints
16


 Passage 8
An alarming number of Mediterranean monk seals, an endangered species, have recently 
died. Postmortem analysis showed the presence of an as yet unidentified virus, as well as 
evidence of a know bacterial toxin. Seawater samples from the area where the seals died did 
contain unusually high concentrations of the toxic bacterium. Therefore, although both viruses 
and bacterial toxins can kill seals, it is more likely that these deaths were the result of the 
bacterial toxin. 
Which of the following, if true, provides additional evidence to support the conclusion? 
A. Viruses are much more difficult to identify in postmortem analysis than bacteria are.
B. Mediterranean monk seals are the only species of seal in the area where the bacterium was
found.
C. The bacterium is almost always present in the water in at least small concentrations.
D. Nearly all the recent deaths were among adult seals, but young seals are far more
susceptible to viruses than are adult seals.
E. Several years ago, a large number of monk seals died in the same area as a result of
exposure to a different bacterial toxin.
Passage 9
An Irish newspaper editorial encouraging women to participate in the non-importation 
movement launched in Ireland in 1779 appears consistent with a perception that the political 
use of the consumer boycott originated in North America and spread eastwards across the 
Atlantic to Ireland. This is a view that most historians have concurred with. For example, T.H. 
Breen argued that the consumer boycott was a brilliantly original American invention. Breen 
did acknowledge that a few isolated boycotts may have taken place in other countries. 
However, Mary ODowd argues that from the late seventeenth century, Irish political discourse 
advocated for the nonconsumption of imported goods and support for home manufactures by 
women in ways that were strikingly similar to those used later in North America. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. resolving a dispute
B. advocating a course of action
C. tracing the evolution of a practice
D. citing competing views of an issue
E. chronicling a series of events
2. In the context of the passage, the highlighted sentence serves to
A. qualify a point made in the preceding sentence
B. correct an erroneous assumption
C. provide evidence in support of a perception cited in the opening sentence
D. provide a rationale for the view expressed in the following sentence
E. establish the popularity of a point of view
17


 Passage 10
A law has been proposed requiring the cargo boxes of trucks carrying gravel to be covered by 
a tarpaulin, because vehicles driving close behind open-topped gravel trucks can be damaged 
by gravel flying off these trucks. The law is unlikely to substantially reduce such damage, 
however: flying gravel is much less likely to come from the cargo box itself than from the 
grooves of the tires, in which gravel can become wedged during loading. 
Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for the argument given? 
A. The drivers of vehicles behind a gravel truck are more likely to remain close behind the
truck if the trucks cargo box is covered than if it is uncovered.
B. Most trucks that carry gravel already carry tarpaulins that their drivers use to cover the
cargo box when they are carrying sand, which can blow out of the cargo box in significant
quantities.
C. Of all the damage that occurs to vehicles on the highway, debris that flies off trucks is the
cause of only a very small fraction.
D. The proposed law allows open-topped trucks on the highway to have uncovered cargo
boxes whenever their cargo boxes are empty.
E. Because of the great weight of a load of gravel, the driver of a gravel truck is often driving
much more slowly than most of the other vehicles on the road.
Passage 11
Before feminist literary criticism emerged in the 1970s, the nineteenth-century United States 
writer Fanny Fern was regarded by most critics (when considered at all) as a prototype of 
weepy sentimentalism—a pious, insipid icon of conventional American culture. Feminist 
reclamations of Fern, by contrast, emphasize her nonsentimental qualities, particularly her 
sharply humorous social criticism. Most feminist scholars find it difficult to reconcile Fern’s 
sardonic social critiques with her effusive celebrations of many conventional values. 
Attempting to resolve this contradiction, Harris concludes that Fern employed flowery 
rhetoric strategically to disguise her subversive goals beneath apparent 
conventionality. However, Tompkins proposes an alternative view of sentimentality itself, 
suggesting that sentimental writing could serve radical, rather than only conservative ends by 
swaying readers emotionally, moving them to embrace social change. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. The passage suggests which of the following about the contradiction mentioned in the
highlighted sentence?
A. It was not generally addressed by critics before the 1970s.
B. It is apparent in only a small number of Ferns writings.
C. It has troubled many feminist critics who study Fern.
2. It can be inferred from the passage that Tompkins would be most likely to agree with which
of the following about the critics mentioned in the passage?
A. They accurately characterize the overall result Fern is aiming to achieve.
B. They are not as dismissive of Fern as some feminist critics have suggested.
C. They exaggerate the extent to which Fern intended her writing to serve a social purpose.
D. They wrongly assume that sentimental must be a pejorative term.
E. They fail to recognize the role that sentimental rhetoric plays to reader’s emotions.
3. It can be inferred that the author of the passage mentions Fern’s “sharply humorous social
criticism” primarily in order to
A. contrast Fern’s apparent intentions with the impression her writing made on Harris
18


B. suggest that many feminist critics have attributed to Fern intentions that she may not have had
C. identify an aspect of Fern’s writing that strikes some scholars as incompatible with other
attributes of her writing
D. help account for the effect Fern's writing had on critics of her own time
E. identify the aspects of Fern's writing for which she was primarily known prior to the 1970s
4. In the context in which it appears, “reclamations” most nearly means
A. reformations
B. rehabilitations
C. recapitulations
D. retractions
E. reiterations
Passage 12
A plant-based automobile fuel has just become available in Ternland. A car can be driven as 
far on a gallon of the new plant-based fuel as a car can be driven on a gallon of gasoline, but a 
gallon of the plant-based fuel both costs less and results in less pollution. Therefore, drivers in 
Ternland who switch to it will reduce the amount they spend on fuel in a year while causing 
less environmental damage. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? 
A. There is no expense associated with operating an automobile that is higher when the
automobile uses the plant-based fuel than when it uses gasoline.
B. Automobiles that have been operated using the plant-based fuel can no longer be operated
using regular gasoline.
C. The environmental damage attributable to automobiles is due almost entirely to the
production and combustion of fuel automobiles use.
D. The advantages of the plant-based fuel over gasoline will not lead those who switch to the
plant-based fuel to do more driving.
E. Most drivers in Ternland will switch from gasoline to the plant-based fuel.
19


 Passage 13
Biologists have long debated about whether egg production in birds is biologically highly 
costly, some theorizing that egg production is energetically or nutritionally demanding. Lack, 
however, suggested that clutch size—the number of eggs a bird lays per breeding cycle—is far 
below the potential limit of egg production. He suggested that clutch size had instead evolved 
in relation to the number of young that the parents could successfully rear. Subsequently, most 
studies focused on limitations operating during chick rearing, particularly among altricial 
species (species in which the parents feed their young in the nest). Lack later recognized that 
in precocial species (species in which young feed themselves), clutch size might be explained 
by different factors—the availability of food for egg-laying females, for example. 
1. The passage suggests that biologists who say egg production in birds is biologically highly
costly would agree that clutch size is determined primarily by
A. the nutritional and energy demands of egg production
B. the number of young that the parents can rear successfully
C. reproductive limitations operating during chick rearing
D. the availability of food for newly hatched chicks
E. the differences between altricial and precocial species
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. The passage suggests that Lack would agree with which of the following statements about
factors affecting clutch size in birds?
A. In altricial species, clutch size is determined primarily by factors operating after eggs are
laid.
B. In precocial species, clutch size is determined primarily by factors operating after eggs are
laid.
C. In many bird species, clutch size generally remains well below the potential limit of egg
production.
20


 Passage 14
Carla L. Peterson’s Doers of the Word (1997), a study of African American women speakers 
and writers from 1830-1880, is an important addition to scholarship on nineteenth-century 
African American women. Its scope resembles that of Frances Smith Fosters 1993 study, but 
its approach is quite different. For Foster, the Black women who came to literary voice in 
nineteenth-century America were claiming their rights as United States citizens, denying that 
anything should disqualify them from full membership in an enlightened national polity. 
Peterson sees these same women as having been fundamentally estranged from the nation by 
a dominant culture unsympathetic to Black women, and by a Black intelligentsia whose male 
view of race concerns left little room for Black female intellect. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. The passage indicates that Peterson identifies which of the following as obstacles faced by
the women included in her study?
A. the attitudes of Black male intellectuals toward female intellectual work
B. the discriminatory attitudes faced by Black women in nineteenth-century America as a
whole
C. disagreements among Black women speakers and writers themselves about the impact of
the Black intelligentsia
2. It can be inferred that Peterson’s study and Fosters study are similar with respect to which
of the following?
A. the writers that each takes up for examination
B. the degree to which each has influenced other scholars
C. the assumptions that each brings to nineteenth-century African American literature
D. their analysis of the nineteenth-century Black intelligentsia
E. their interpretation of nineteenth-century Americas dominant culture
21


 Passage 15
David Belasco’s 1912 Broadway production of The Governors Lady created a sensation with a 
scene set in a Childs cafeteria, a chain restaurant that was an innovator in food 
standardization and emblematic of modern everyday life. While Belasco’s meticulously 
detailed reproduction of an immediately recognizable setting impressed the public, it was 
derided by progressive theater critics who championed the New Stagecraft theories of 
European artists like Max Reinhardt. The New Stagecraft rejected theatrical literalism; it drew 
inspiration from the subjectivity and minimalism of modern painters, advocating simplified sets 
designed to express a dramatic texts central ideas. Such critics considered Belasco a 
craftsman who merely captured surface realities: a true artist eliminated the inessential to 
create more meaningful, expressive stage images. 
1. The author of the passage implies which of the following about Belasco’s production of The
Governors Lady?
A. It was dismissed by certain theater critics who misunderstood Belasco’s conception of
modernity.
B. It was intended to marshal elements of the New Stagecraft to serve Belasco’s predilection
for realistic staging.
C. It demonstrated that theatrical literalism could be used effectively to express a dramatic
texts central ideas.
D. It elicited responses that reflected a discrepancy between popular tastes in entertainment
and the tastes of progressive theater critics.
E. It relied on the appeal of an impressively realistic stage set to compensate for weaknesses
in other aspects of the production.
2. It can be inferred that the theater critics would be most likely to agree with which of the
following statements about the theatrical productions?
A. Theatrical productions that seek to eliminate the inessential also often eliminate theatrical
elements that enhance the expressiveness of a play.
B. Theatrical productions that faithfully recreate the visual details of everyday life are unlikely
to do justice to a good play’s central ideas.
C. Theatrical productions that employ the minimalism characteristic of modern paintings may
have greater appeal to modern audiences than productions that rely on theatrical literalism.
D. Theatrical productions that aim to represent truths about modern life should not attempt to
employ elements of the New Stagecraft.
E. Theatrical productions that attempt to produce authentic-looking scenes of everyday reality
are likely to fail in that goal because of the theaters inherent limitations.
22


 Passage 16
Currently, Sulandian television journalists are twice as likely as other workers to support the 
Blue Party, and Sulandian journalism students are significantly more likely to support the Blue 
Party than working television journalists are. Therefore, assuming that these students do not 
change their political affiliations as they get older, the disparity between the political affiliations 
of Sulandia’s television journalists and those of the rest of the working population will increase 
as current Sulandian journalism students enter the profession. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
A. Few of the television journalists currently working in Sulandia were trained in Sulandian
journalism schools.
B. Journalists in Sulandia whose political affiliations differ from those of the general population
tend to allow their political views to affect the way they report news about politics.
C. Most of the television journalists currently working in Sulandia who support the Blue Party
also supported the Blue Party when they were students.
D. Support for the Blue party is not significantly less common among those current Sulaidan
journalism students who intend to become television journalists than it is among current
Sulandian journalism students as a whole.
E. Classes in Sulandian journalism schools are not taught mainly by working Sulandian
journalists.
Passage 17
Early naturalists believed two species of beaver lived in North America: dam beavers and bank 
beavers. The bank species was thought to resemble the muskrat in behavior, living in burrows 
or lodges and unable to build dams. In fact, dams are primarily a strategy for dealing with 
annual variations in water levels. If water levels fall in summer, as they do in most of North 
America, then beavers lodge entrances may be exposed. With stabilized water levels, their 
homes are much safer. Along deep rivers, where bank beavers are found, this problem seldom 
arises. But these beavers do know how to build dams, and do so if the need arises, as may 
occur if they are forced to relocate after felling and consuming all nearby trees. 
1. The passage provides support for which of the following statements about beaver dams?
A. One important function of these dams is to protect beavers homes.
B. Most are built prior to burrow construction.
C. They are found mostly along deep rivers.
D. They are routinely abandoned as nearby forests are depleted.
E. They mainly protect beavers from rising water levels.
2. The passage implies which of the following about beavers?
A. Bank beavers are unable to successfully compete with dam beavers when resources
become scarce.
B. Differences in dam-building behavior among beavers do not necessarily imply multiple
beaver species.
C. Building dams eventually causes beavers to deplete nearby resources.
D. When conditions permit, beavers are more likely to build dams than burrows or lodges.
E. In beavers, dam-building is an acquired rather than an innate skill.
3. The passage provides support for which of the following statements about beaver dams?
A. One important function of these dams is to protect beavers’ homes.
B. They are less likely to be found along deep rivers.
C. They are routinely abandoned before nearby forests are depleted.
23


4. It can be inferred from the passage that early naturalists considered which of the following
criteria when classifying beavers?
A. The genetic similarity of beavers and muskrats
B. The propensity of beavers to relocate
C. The depth of water beavers occupied
D. Beavers’ dam-building capabilities
E. Beavers’ degree of exposure to danger
24


 Passage 18
Massive projectiles striking much larger bodies create various kinds of craters, 
including multi-ring basins–the largest geologic features observed on planets and 
moons. In such collisions, the impactor is completely destroyed and its material is 
incorporated into the larger body. Collison’s between bodies of comparable size, on the other 
hand, have very different consequences: one or both bodies might be entirely smashed, with 
mass from one or both the bodies redistributed among new objects formed from the fragments. 
Such a titanic collision between Earth and a Mars-size impactor may have given rise to Earth’s 
Moon.
The Earth-Moon system has always been perplexing. Earth is the only one of the inner planets 
with a large satellite, the orbit of which is neither in the equatorial plane of Earth nor in the 
plane in which the other planets lie. The Moon’s mean density is much lower than that of Earth 
but is about the same as that of Earth’s mantle. This similarity in density has long prompted 
speculation that the Moon split away from a rapidly rotating Earth, but this idea founders on 
two observations. In order to spin off the Moon, Earth would have had to rotate so fast that a 
day would have lasted less than three hours. Science offers no plausible explanation of how it 
could have slowed to its current rotational rate from that speed. Moreover, the Moon’s 
composition, though similar to that of Earth’s mantle, is not a precise match. Theorizing a 
titanic collision eliminates postulating a too-rapidly spinning Earth and accounts for the Moon’s 
peculiar composition. In a titanic collision model, the bulk of the Moon would have formed from 
a combination of material from the impactor and Earth’s mantle. Most of the earthly component 
would have been in the form of melted or vaporized matter. The difficulty in recondensing this 
vapor in Earth’s orbit, and its subsequent loss to the vacuum of outer space, might account for 
the observed absence in lunar rocks of certain readily vaporized compounds and elements. 
Unusual features of some other planets might also be explained by such impacts. Mercury is 
known to have a high density in comparison with other rocky planets. A titanic impact could 
have stripped away a portion of its rocky mantle, leaving behind a metallic core whose density 
is out of proportion with the original ratio of rock to metal. A massive, glancing blow to Venus 
might have given it its anomalously slow spin and reversed direction of rotation. Such 
conjectures are tempting, but, since no early planet was immune to titanic impacts, they could 
be used indiscriminately to explain away in a cavalier fashion every unusual planetary 
characteristic; still, we may now be beginning to discern the true role of titanic impacts in 
planetary history. 
1. According to the passage, which of the following is true of the collisions mentioned in the
highlighted sentence?
A. They occur less frequently than do titanic collisions.
B. They occur between bodies of comparable size.
C. They occur primarily between planet-sized bodies.
D. They result in the complete destruction of the impacting body.
E. They result in mass being redistributed among newly formed objects.
2. The author of the passage asserts which of the following about titanic collision models?
A. Such models are conclusive with respect to certain anomalies within the solar system, but
leave numerous other anomalies unexplained.
B. Such models are more likely than are earlier models to account for the formation of multi-
ring basins.
C. Such models may be particularly useful in explaining what happens when the impacting
bodies involved are of highly dissimilar mean densities.
D. Such models have been tested to such a degree that they are quickly reaching the point
where they can be considered definitive.
E. Such models are so tempting that they run the risk of being used indiscriminately to explain 
unusual planetary features.
3. The passage suggests that which of the following is true of the cited compounds and 
elements?
A. They were created by reactions that took place during a titanic collision.
B. They were supplied by an impactor that collided with Earth.

B. summarizing conventional theories about the formation of the earth-Moon system.
C. anticipating and responding to criticisms of a particular theory about the formation of the
Earth-Moon system.
D. explaining why the Earth-Moon system is considered scientifically perplexing.
E. questioning an assumption underlying one theory about the formation of the Earth-Moon
system.

 Passage 19
The history of the transmission of ancient Roman texts prior to invention of the printing press 
is reconstructed from evidence both internal and external to the texts themselves. Internal 
evidence is used to reconstruct the relationship of the surviving manuscripts of a Roman text 
to one another, as represented in a modern stemma codicum: a diagram depicting the 
genealogical relationship of surviving manuscripts and those the stemmas editor believes 
existed at one time. Stemma are scholar’s only road maps to textual connections based on 
internal evidence, but they may paint a distorted picture of reality because they diagram the 
relationships of only those manuscripts known or inferred today. If surviving copies are few, 
the stemma perforce brings into proximity manuscripts that were widely separated in time and 
place of origin. Conversely, the stemma can also bestow a semblance of separation on 
manuscripts written within a few months of one another or even in the same room.
One type of external evidence that may shed light on the transmission of Roman texts is the 
availability of a work in the Middle Ages, when many classical texts were circulated. Too often, 
though, too much is inferred about a particular works circulation in the Middle Ages from the 
number of manuscripts surviving today. When a work survives in a single manuscript copy, 
editors call the manuscript, rather glamorously, the lone survivor–implying that all its 
(presumably rare) companions were destroyed sometime early in the Middle Ages by pillaging 
barbarians. It is equally possible that the work survived far into the Middle Ages in numerous 
copies in monastic libraries but were unnoticed due to lack of interest. The number of extant 
manuscripts, however few, really does not allow scholars to infer how many ancient Latin 
manuscripts of a work survived to the ninth, the twelfth, or even the fifteenth century.
Quotations from a Roman text by a medieval author are another category of external evidence: 
but does the appearance of a rare word or grammatical construction—or even a short passage
—really indicate a medieval author’s firsthand knowledge of this or that ancient work, or does 
such usage instead derive from some intermediate source, such as a grammar book or a 
popular style manual? Medieval authors do quote extensively from ancient authors; while such 
quotations provide some evidence of the works medieval circulation, as well as define its 
evolving fortunes and the various uses to which it was put, they may be far less useful in 
reconstructing the text of an ancient work.
Much as scholars want to look for overall patterns and formulate useful generalizations, the 
transmission of each text is a different story and each manuscripts history is unique. Scholars 
must be careful not to draw conclusions that go beyond what the evidence can support. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with which of the following?
A. tracing certain changes in the methods used to study the transmission of ancient Roman
texts.
B. contrasting two types of evidence used in investigating the transmission of ancient Roman
texts.
C. outlining certain difficulties associated with studying the transmission of ancient Roman
texts.
D. advocating the use of one type of evidence about ancient Roman texts over the use of
another type.
E. explaining the development and potential uses and drawbacks of stemma in the study of
ancient Roman texts.
27


2. As described in the passage, a stemma is most closely analogous to which of the following?
A. a department store inventory list that excludes some departments
B. a map from which a large section has been torn off
C. a chronology that includes only major historical events
D. a family tree in which some generations are not recorded
E. a government organizational chart from which some agencies are omitted
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
3. In its discussion of external evidence, the passage suggests which of the following about
manuscripts of ancient Roman texts during the Middle Ages?
A. It is possible that fewer manuscripts were destroyed by barbarians in the early Middle Ages
than scholars frequently suppose.
B. Additional copies of some so-called lone survivor manuscripts may have existed well into
the Middle Ages.
C. If an ancient Roman text is quoted in a work by a medieval author, then it is likely that at
least one manuscript copy of that text survived into the Middle Ages.
4. Click on the sentence in the first paragraph that suggests that scholars might be led to
underestimate the extent of the connection between certain manuscripts.

 Passage 20
In 1995 the Galileo spacecraft captured data about Jupiters atmosphere—namely, the absence 
of most of the predicted atmospheric water—that challenged prevailing theories about Jupiters 
structure. The unexpectedness of this finding fits a larger pattern in which theories about 
planetary composition and dynamics have failed to predict the realities discovered through 
space exploration. Instead of normal planets whose composition could be predicted by theory, 
the planets populating our solar system are unique individuals whose chemical and tectonic 
identities were created through numerous contingent events. One implication of this is that 
although the universe undoubtedly holds other planetary systems, the duplication of the 
sequence that produced our solar system and the development of life on Earth is highly 
unlikely.
Recently planetary scientists have suggested that the external preconditions for the 
development of Earth’s biosphere probably included four paramount contingencies. First, a 
climate conducive to life on Earth depends upon the extraordinarily narrow orbital parameters 
that define a continuously habitable zone where water can exist in a liquid state. If Earths orbit 
were only 5 percent smaller than it is, temperatures during the early stages of Earths history 
would have been high enough to vaporize the oceans. If the Earth-Sun distance were as little 
as 1 percent larger, runaway glaciation on Earth about 2 billion years ago would have caused 
the oceans to freeze and remain frozen to this day. Second, Jupiter’s enormous mass prevents 
most Sun-bound comets from penetrating the inner solar system. It has been estimated that 
without this shield, Earth would have experienced bombardment by comet-sized impactors a 
thousand times more frequently than has actually been recorded during geological time. Even 
if Earth‘s surface were not actually sterilized by this bombardment, it is unlikely that any but 
the most primitive life-forms could have survived. This suggests that only planetary systems 
containing both terrestrial planets like Earth and gas giants like Jupiter might be capable of 
sustaining complex life-forms.
Third, the gravitational shield of the giant outer planets, while highly efficient, must 
occasionally fail to protect Earth. Paradoxically, while the temperatures required for liquid 
water exist only in the inner solar system, the key building blocks of life, including water itself, 
occur primarily beyond the asteroid belt. Thus the evolution of life has depended on a 
frequency of cometary impacts sufficient to convey water, as well as carbon and nitrogen, from 
these distant regions of the solar system to Earth while stopping short of an impact magnitude 
that would destroy the atmosphere and oceans. 
Finally, Earth’s unique and massive satellite, the Moon, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the 
obliquity of Earth’s rotational axis, this obliquity creates the terrestrial seasonality so important 
to the evolution and diversity of life. Mars, in contrast, has a wildly oscillating tilt and chaotic 
seasonality, while Venus, rotating slowly backward, has virtually no seasonality at all. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. enumerating conditions that may have been necessary for a particular development
B. outlining the conditions under which scientists may be able to predict certain events
C. explaining how a particular finding affected scientists understanding of a phenomenon
D. suggesting reasons why a particular outcome was more likely to occur than other possible
outcomes
E. assessing the relative significance of factors that contributed to a particular occurrence
29


2. It can be inferred from the passage that the planetary scientists would be most likely to 
agree with which of the following statements concerning the development of complex life forms 
on Earth?
A. It might have occurred earlier in Earths history if cometary impacts had been less frequent
than they were.
B. It could have occurred if Earths orbit were 1 percent larger than it is but not if Earths orbit
were 5 percent smaller
C. It probably follows a pattern common on other terrestrial planets that occupy planetary
systems containing gas giants.
D. Its dependence on the effect that Jupiters gravitational shield has on Earth was difficult to
recognize prior to 1995.
E. It has been contingent on conditions elsewhere in Earths solar system as well as on
conditions on Earth itself.
3. The author of the passage most likely mentions Mars oscillating tilt primarily in order to
A. provide evidence for a proposition about the potential effects of cometary impacts
B. emphasize the absence from our solar system of normal planets
C. contrast the rotational axis of Mars with that of Venus
D. characterize the role of other planets in the solar system in earths development
E. emphasize the importance of the Moon to the development of life on Earth
4. The passage suggests each of the following about water on Earth EXCEPT:
A. It was conveyed to Earth by comets.
B. It appeared on Earth earlier than did carbon and nitrogen.
C. Its existence in a liquid state is contingent on Earths orbital parameters.
D. Much of it came from a part of the solar system where water cannot exist in a liquid state.
E. It is unlikely that there would be much of it available to support life if the gravitational shield
of the outer planets did not limit the frequency with which comets strike Earth.

 Passage 21
Received feminist wisdom has conceived of history as a male enclave devoid of woman 
subjects and practitioners, particularly before the twentieth century. As Ann For Freedom put it 
in 1972, from Herodout’s to Will Durant’s histories, the main characters, the main viewpoints 
and interests, have all been male. Feminist accounts of the 1970s and 1980s viewed 
historiography (the writing of history) as overwhelmingly his, coining the term herstory and 
presenting it as a compensatory feminist practice. Herstory designated women’s place at the 
center of an alternative narrative of past events. Rosalind Miles’s description restates the 
popular view: Women’s history by contrast has only just begun to invent itself. Males gained 
entry to the business of recording, defining and interpreting events in the third millennium 
B.C.; for women, this process did not even begin until the nineteenth century. The herstorical
method provided a means for feminist historians to explore materials by and about women that
had previously been neglected or ignored. Herstory promoted curricular transformation in
schools and was used as a slogan on T-shirts, pencils, and buttons. Exposing historians tacit
and intentional sexism, herstorians set out to correct the record–to show that women had held
up half the historical sky.
Despite the great scholarly gains made behind the rallying cry, herstory’s popular myth–
particularly about the lack of women who have recorded history–require revision. Herstory may 
accurately describe feminists efforts to construct female- centered accounts of the past, but 
the term inadvertently blinds us to women’s important contributions to historical discourse 
before the nineteenth century. Historiography has not been an entirely male preserve, though 
feminists are justified in faulting its long-standing masculine contours. In fact, criticism of 
historiography’s sexism is not of recent origin. Early eighteenth-century feminist Mary Astell 
protested that the Men being the Historians, they seldom condescend to record the great and 
good actions of Women. Astell, like those who echoed her sentiments two and a half centuries 
later, must be credited for admirable zeal in setting out to right scholarly wrongs, but her 
supposition that historians were only male is inaccurate. Her perception is especially strange 
because she herself wrote a historical work, An Impartial Enquiry into the Cause of Rebellion 
and Civil War (1704). Astell’s judgment is at the same time understandable, given that much 
historical writing by women of the late seventeenth century was not published until the 
nineteenth century. Despite their courage and their rightful anger, Astell and her descendants 
overlooked early modern woman writer’s contributions to historiography. 
1. It can be inferred that Rosalind Miles refers to the third millennium B.C. primarily in order to
A. present an overview of what the practice of history once entailed
B. suggest that the origins of historical study are much earlier than had been previously
though
C. suggest why the third millennium B.C. has received so much attention from historians
D. establish a contrast between men and women in terms of how long they have been
recording history
E. indicate how significantly the practice of history has changed since the third millennium B.C.
2. It can be inferred from the passage that the term herstory
A. was popular mainly in the nineteenth century
B. is an old term that feminist put to new uses
C. is controversial within the feminist community
D. is not especially useful to scholars
E. was invented to help make a particular point
31


3. Mary Astell is discussed by the author as an example of an eighteenth-century feminist
historian
A. who was representative of the intellectual interests of the woman historians of her time
B. who inspired many practitioners of herstory in the twentieth century
C. who shared with modern herstorian’s a mistaken assumption regarding the writing of history
D. whose major work aroused much controversy at the time of its publication
E. whose major work still has not received the attention from scholars that it deserves
4. The author implies which of the following about Astell’s supposition?
A. It is likely to have arisen because of Astell’s unawareness of much of the historical work
written by women.
B. It was one that Astell reconsidered after she wrote her own historical work.
C. It was one that was not shared by other feminist historians of Astell’s time.
D. It was one that inspired Astell to write her own historical work.
E. It directly contradicts one of the basic claims of herstory.

 Passage 22
Until around 1930 few United States Civil War historians paid much attention to Southerners 
who opposed the 1861-1865 secession from the United States by a confederacy of Southern 
states. Southern historians clung instead to a notion of the South’s unanimity in the face of 
Northern aggression. Only when scholars such as Lonn decided to examine this side of the 
war did historian of the Confederacy begin to recognize the existence of Southerners loyal to 
the Union (Unionists). While these early historians of Southern dissent broke new ground, they 
also reproduced Confederate authoritie’s negative view of loyalists as shady characters driven 
by dubious motives. Even Tatum, who took a largely sympathetic attitude toward loyalists, 
tended to lump them into nebulous categories, offering broad generalizations that ignored the 
particulars of Unionists’ identities and experiences.
This early-twentieth-century historiography nonetheless represented the leading research on 
dissent in the South until the 1960s and 1970s. Spurred by the advent of social historical 
methods, a new generation of historians found Unionists interesting as manifestations of the 
Confederacy’s internal weaknesses. Focusing on the Appalachian Mountain and upper South 
regions of the Confederacy, these scholars argued that there was a profound divide among 
Southern Whites between those who benefited economically from slave-run plantations and 
those who did not. One such historian was Escott, who emphasized regional and economic 
conflict among Southerners. Escott cast Unionists and other dissenters as antiplanter 
mountaineers who could not, by reason of economic and social alienation, identify with the 
proslavery Southern cause. This theme has heavily influenced the work of subsequent 
scholars, who commonly place Unionists at the extreme end of a continuum of class-based 
Confederate disaffection that was ultimately responsible for the South’s collapse. Because the 
driving force behind such inquiries into loyalist history has been a desire to explain 
Confederate ideology, politics, and defeat, emphasis has been placed on the ways loyalist 
Southerners diverged from the political and economic mainstream of Confederate 
nationalism.
Only recently have some Civil War historians begun to make Unionists and their 
experiences, rather than the Confederate state, the center of inquiry. These scholars have 
done intensive community and local studies of dissenting groups that take into account a 
range of social and cultural, as well as military and political, factors at work on the Southern 
home front. Hoping to better understand who remained loyal to the Union during the war, these 
historians have sought to explain the Civil War’s underlying character, dimensions, and impact 
in particular counties or towns, especially in the upper South and Appalachia. This relatively 
new trend has stressed the particular, delved into the complexities of political allegiances on 
the home front, and, as Sutherland notes, highlighted “the gritty experience of real people”. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. summarize a particular debate among historians

reject the Confederate cause.
34


 Passage 23
In his recent book, Louis Gerteis argues that nineteenth-century Northern reformers in the 
United States attacked slavery in the South by invoking the values of a utilitarian political 
economy: proper public policy requires government to endorse anything that gives all people 
the opportunity to maximize their individual pleasure and their material gain. Social good, 
according to this thinking, is achieved when individuals are free to pursue their self-interests. 
Gerteis argues that, since slavery in the South precluded individual autonomy and the free 
pursuit of material gain, major Northern reformers opposed it as early as the 1830s.
In making this argument, Gerteis offers the most persuasive formulation to date of the Growth 
of a Dissenting Minority interpretation, which argues that a slow but steady evolution of a 
broad-based Northern antislavery coalition culminated in the presidential victory of the 
antislavery Lincoln in 1860. This interpretive framework, which once dominated antislavery 
historiography, had been 
discounted by historians for two basic reasons. First, it tended to homogenize the political 
diversity of Northern reformers; Northern reformers differed significantly among themselves 
and belonged to diverse political parties. Second, it seemed incompatible with emerging 
scholarship on the slaveholding South, which held that Northern abolitionists of the 1830s did 
not succeed in mobilizing Northern public opinion and paving the way for Lincoln in 1860. 
Instead, Southern slaveholders misconstrued abolitionist views of the 1830s as main- stream 
rather than marginal Northern public opinion, and castigated Northerners generally for 
opposing slavery. In this view, it was the castigation by Southerners that gradually caused 
widespread antislavery feeling throughout the North. 
Gerteis revives the Growth interpretation by asserting that, rather than Southern attitudes, the 
unified commitment of Northern reformers to utilitarian values served to galvanize popular 
political support for abolitionism. However, unlike earlier proponents of the Growth 
interpretation, Gerteis does not reduce the Northern reformers to a homogeneous group or try 
to argue that the reformers shared views undermined their differing party loyalties. Members of 
the two major political parties still attacked each other for ideological differences. 
Nevertheless, Gerteis argues, these disparate party affiliations did not diminish the actuality of 
reformer unity, most prominent in the 1830s. At this time, Northern reformers, such as William 
Lloyd Garrison and Samuel Chase, portrayed the framers of the United States Constitution as 
proponents of individual autonomy and capitalist values. This vision of the founders served as 
a basis for asserting that freedom was a national moral imperative, and that the United Sates 
Constitution was an antislavery document. Gerteis differs from traditional adherents of the 
Growth framework by asserting that the basic elements in the antislavery coalition were firmly 
in place and accepted by all elements in the Northern reform community as early as the late 
1830s. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. criticizing adherents of a traditional view for overlooking important data
B. reconciling two different explanations for the same phenomenon
C. describing a reformulation of a traditional interpretation
D. advocating a traditional approach to a controversial subject
E. suggesting that a new interpretation is based on faulty assumptions
2. The author would be most likely to agree with which of the following about Gerteis
formulation of the Growth interpretation?
A. It is too similar to the traditional version of the Growth interpretation.
B. It is of dubious validity and does not expand research on the antislavery movement.
C. It is strongly supported by recent research on the nineteenth-century South.
D. It is more convincing than the traditional version of the Growth interpretation.
E. It is seminal work that will be highly influential on future research.
35


3. The passage supports which of the following statements about the Growth interpretation?
A. It had been dismissed by earlier historians but has recently come to dominate antislavery
historiography.
B. It has recently received support from emerging scholarship on the nineteenth-century
South.
C. It was once very influential in antislavery historiography and has recently been
reformulated.
D. It has always been highly controversial and is still widely debated by historians.
E. It has recently been discounted by emerging scholarship on utilitarian values in the
nineteenth-century South.
4. Which of the following, if true, would provide the LEAST support for Gerteis arguments as
they are discussed in the passage?
A. In the 1870s, following the abolition of slavery, many Northerners remained unified in their
desire to see an effective free-labor system implemented in the South.
B. As early as the 1830s, Northern abolitionists and Northern reformers with a commitment to
utilitarian values began to agree that the United States Constitution was an important
antislavery document.
C. Many Northern reformers who disagreed about political policies argued that abolishing
slavery should be a central goal of the United States government.
D. As early as 1836, many Northern reformers argued that slavery destroyed individuals ability
to pursue their self-interests and thwarted the free pursuit of material gain.
E. Owing to their different party allegiances, Northern reformers who shared utilitarian values
did not join together in important collective actions against slavery.
5. The author of the passage mentions “emerging scholarship” most probably in order to
A. describe an argument that has been advanced to challenge the “Growth” interpretation
B. show how Gerteis has used recent research to support his formulation of the “Growth”
interpretation
C. explain how the “Growth” interpretation was originally developed
D. discuss a theory about the nineteenth century North that is very similar to the ‘‘Growth’’
interpretation
E. suggest that the “Growth” interpretation is no longer discussed among historians
36


 Passage 24
Historian E.H Carr’s thesis that all debates concerning the explanation of historical 
phenomena revolve around the question of the priority of causes is so familiar to historians as 
to constitute orthodoxy within their profession. The true historian, as Carr puts it, will feel a 
professional obligation to place the multiple causes of a historical event in a hierarchy by 
means of which the primary or ultimate cause of the event can be identified. In the Marxist 
mode of historical explanation (historical materialism), a universal hierarchy of causes is 
posited in which economic factors are always primary. In the classic, more widely accepted 
alternative ultimately derived from Weberian sociology, hierarchies of causes are treated as 
historically specific: explanatory primacy in any particular historical situation must be 
established by empirical investigation of that situation, not by applying a universal model of 
historical causation. 
While the need to rank historical causes in some order of importance may seem obvious to 
most historians, such hierarchies raise serious philosophical difficulties. If any historical event 
is the product of a number of factors, then each of these factor is indispensable to the 
occurrence of the event. But how can one cause be more indispensable than another? And if it 
cannot, how can there be a hierarchy of indispensable causes? It was this problem that first 
led Weber himself to argue for the impossibility of any general formula specifying the relative 
importance of causes; we cannot, for example, conclude that in every capitalist society 
religious change has been more significant than economic change (or vice versa) in explaining 
the rise of capitalism.
Runciman offers a different argument leading to the same conclusion. He points out that it is 
possible to identify specific factors as the primary causes of a particular historical event only 
relative to an initial set of background conditions. For instance, if we accept English defeats 
after 1369 in the Hundred Years War as a given, then we may identify the high levels of 
taxation necessitated by these military reverses as the main cause of the Peasants Revolt of 
1381. If instead we regard the financing of warfare by taxation in this period as a background 
condition, then we will see the English reverses themselves as the main cause of the revolt. 
However, neither ordinary life nor historical practice offer reliable criteria by which to 
distinguish causes from background conditions and thus to resolve historical debates about 
the relative importance of causes. And this difficulty casts doubt not only on the Marxist effort 
to identify a universal hierarchy of causes, but also on any attempt to identify an objective 
hierarchy of causes–even of the historically specific kind favored by non-Marxists. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. compare two prominent models of historical explanation
B. undermine non-Marxist objections to the historical-materialist explanatory model of
historical causation
C. analyze ways in which the question of historical causation can be illuminated by Weberian
sociology
D. challenge an orthodox position concerning historical explanation
E. argue that historical analysis should rely more on empirical investigation than on
philosophical reflection
2. According to the passage, most historians share the assumption that
A. The most useful current model of historical causation is the historical-materialist model.
B. Explaining a historical event requires ranking its causes by importance.
C. The same hierarchy of causes underlies every historical event.
D. Philosophical debates have limited utility for historical practice.
E. Different causes of the same historical event sometimes have the same importance.
37


3. In the second paragraph of the passage, the author uses the concept of an indispensable
cause primarily in order to question which of the following claims?
A. Generalizations about the origins of capitalist societies are defensible.
B. The study of history is largely independent of philosophical concerns.
C. A universal model of historical causation is indefensible.
D. A historical event is caused by many factors.
E. A hierarchy of the causes of a historical event can be determined.
4. Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?

B. Opposing views are compared, contrasted, and shown to be compatible.
C. An argument is advanced, criticized, and then revised.

 Passage 25
Modern feminism has brought the reputation of the English writer Mary Wollstonecraft 
(1759-1797) to something approaching the luster it deserves. While she enjoyed a certain 
celebrity among political radicals in the years just after her death, beginning in the nineteenth 
century her fame as a writer was hidden by disproportionate attention to her unconventional 
and, at the time, shocking personal life. When, therefore, Virginia Woolf wrote in 1925 of 
Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Men and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman 
that they felt like books so true that they seem now to contain nothing new in them, it was 
more a wishful than an accurate statement of the case. Wollstonecraft’s advances in moral 
thinking still have the power to shock position-takers of every party. The importance of gender 
even today is said to cut across other criteria for judging the conduct of men and women in 
society; Wollstonecraft, by contrast, believed that the shared morality of men and women 
should cut across all specifications of gender.
Wollstonecraft considered gender-based morality a relic of a barbarous age: part of that 
specialization of virtues by which every sexual feeling was expected to express itself as 
libertinism (in men) or false modesty (in women). In her view, there ought to be one criterion of 
morals for men and women alike, with both sexes cultivating the same virtues. Wollstonecraft 
rebelled against the copious sentimental literature of her own time, which she felt patronized 
women by insisting that it was to their advantage to affect chastity and modesty and that such 
virtues were their own reward.
In The Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft explores this double Bulosan standard from an 
unexpected angle. It was the first major response to Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the 
Revolution in France (1790), appearing less than a month after the impassioned defense of 
the deposed French monarchy. A defender of Burke called Wollstonecraft’s book an 
incoherent mass of treacherous candour, interested generosity, and, if not false, at least 
unnecessary accusation. But Wollstonecraft nonetheless managed to show how the 
traditionally feminine virtues of sentimental morality had been transferred by Burke to the 
aristocracy. Burke’s rhapsody on the queen of France (glittering like the morning star, full of 
life, and splendor, and joy) was, for Wollstonecraft, an example of the argument that beauty 
and instinct must often prevail over reason, the argument on which Burke took his stand as a 
defender of the old order. Like women, Burke thought, and from a similar greatness and 
delicacy in their nature, the aristocracy were understood at once to require deference and to 
solicit compassion. To Wollstonecraft, Burke’s argument linked sympathy and power in a 
dangerous alliance; she insisted that aristocrats do not deserve to be treated in the way that 
women have traditionally been treated any more than women themselves do. 
1. By quoting Burke’s defender in the highlighted phrase, the author of the passage most
clearly succeeds in
A. providing a context for the political turbulence that unseated the French monarchy
B. emphasizing the way in which Wollstonecraft’s philosophy divided men and women
C. explaining why Wollstonecraft’s work has won more acceptance in the twentieth century
than in the nineteenth
D. illustrating the nature of the appeal of Burkes argument
E. demonstrating the degree of hostility aroused by Wollstonecraft’s work
2. The author of the passage quotes Burke’s description of the queen of France most probably
in order to
A. provide a specific illustration of a position with which Wollstonecraft took issue
B. provide a specific example of Burke’s already archaic prose style
C. balance the quotation from Burkes anonymous defender
D. provide evidence of why Burkes position was more widely accepted than Wollstonecraft’s
E. provide an example of what Wollstonecraft perceived as Burke’s lack of political astuteness

3. The passage suggests that which of the following is true concerning Virginia Woolf’s
appraisal of A Vindication of the Rights of Men and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman?
A. Woolf was defending Wollstonecraft’s theories against attacks by nineteenth—century
critics who concentrated only on Wollstonecraft’s notoriety.
B. Woolf favored the advances proposed by Wollstonecraft and mistakenly assumed that they
had become self-evident in the twentieth century.
C. Woolf miscalculated the practical effects that the advances proposed by Wollstonecraft
would have on society.
D. Woolf decried the loss in the twentieth-century of social progress made in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries.
E. Woolf was reacting against what she considered a lack of originality on Wollstonecraft’s part
while calling for more sweeping changes than Wollstonecraft had proposed.
4. The author of the passage suggests that modern feminism has treated the writings of Mary
Wollstonecraft in which of the following ways?
A. Modern feminism has emphasized the progressive aspects of Wollstonecraft’s writings,
while separating her work from her personal reputation.
B. Modern feminism has emphasized Wollstonecraft’s importance as a theorist, while
deemphasizing her effect on the daily life of her times.
C. Modern feminism has worked toward a synthesis of Wollstonecraft’s philosophical advances
with those of her contemporaries.
D. Modern feminism has embraced Wollstonecraft’s relative importance as a theorist, while
rejecting certain elements of her theories of gender-based morality.
E. Modern feminism has equated Wollstonecraft’s ideas about the popular sentimentalization
of women with her view of monarchist systems of government.

 Passage 26
Cuts that need to be held closed in order to heal properly have generally been held 
closed with stitches. However, pressure to reduce medical costs is mounting. Consequently, 
it is likely that a newly developed adhesive will become the routine method of holding most 
types of cuts closed. The new adhesive holds most types of cuts closed as well as stitches do, 
and the cost of applying it is comparable to that of closing cuts with stitches. But whereas 
stitches must generally be removed by medical personnel after the cut has healed, the 
adhesive simply wears off. Thus, for any cut that the adhesive can hold closed as well as 
stitches can, it is more economical to use the adhesive. 
In the argument given, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles? 
A. The first is a claim that the argument disputes; the second provides evidence against that
disputed claim.
B. The first is a claim that is used as supporting evidence for the main conclusion of the
argument; the second is that main conclusion.
C. The first is a claim that is used as supporting evidence for the main conclusion of the
argument; the second is a conclusion that is drawn in order to support that main conclusion.
D. The first introduces a practice about which the argument makes a prediction, the second is
a conclusion based on that prediction.
E. The first introduces a practice about which the argument makes a prediction; the second is
an assessment that is used to support that prediction.

 Passage 27
Based on evidence from tree rings, pollen samples and other records, scientists have for a 
long time assumed that interglacials—warm interludes between ice ages—were as mild and 
uniform as the Holocene, the present interglacial, has been for all of its 8,000 to 10,000 years. 
But new research in Greenland has put this assumption into question. 
Researchers on two teams, the Greenland Ice-Core Project (GRIP) and the Greenland Ice 
Sheet Project 2 (GISP2), have analyzed two different cylinders of ice, each about two miles in 
depth, pulled up from the Greenland ice sheet. Such ice cores trap gases, bits of dust, and 
other chemicals that were present in the snow that fell over Greenland for thousands of years 
and then became compressed into ice. By studying these components, scientists have 
obtained a detailed archive of many aspects of climate, including air temperatures, snowfall, 
and concentrations of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere. 
Findings from the upper sections of the cores have confirmed what scientists already knew 
climate during the last ice age fluctuated rapidly. But scientists were astonished by findings 
from the lower sections of the GRIP core, which provided a close look at an interglacial period 
other than our own, the Eemian interglacial, a period that lasted from 135,000 to 115,000 
years ago. Data from GRIP seem to indicate that the Eemian climate swung at least as wildly 
as the climate of ice age periods. 
Researchers’ clues to the Eemian climate come from measurements of the ratios of two 
slightly different types of oxygen, isotopes oxygen-16 and oxygen-18, preserved in the GRIP 
core. These ratios register the fluctuations of air temperatures over the seasons and years. 
When the air was warm, vapor containing the heavier isotope, oxygen-18, condensed and 
formed precipitation, in the form of snow, more readily than did vapor containing oxygen-16. 
Thus, snow that fell during warmer periods contains proportionally more oxygen-18 than snow 
deposited during cold spells. Evidence of rapid climate shifts was also drawn from other 
sources, such as measurements of amounts of dust and calcium ions in the ice layers during 
cold periods: winds were strong, causing calcium-rich dust from loess deposits, which are 
composed of loose surface sediment, to blow across the ice sheet. Thus, differing amounts of 
dust in the layers also indicate changing climatic conditions. 
However, finds from the lower section of GISP 2 do not confirm those of GRIP. The wild 
climate swings shown by GRIP in the last interglacial are not seen in the GISP2 core. 
According to a GISP 2 scientist, the weight of flowing glacial ice above has stressed the lower 
sections of both cores. This may have deformed the lower ice, disrupting its annual layers and 
thereby causing the discrepancy between the records. Still, some climatologists believe 
GRIP’s record may be the more reliable of the two. It was drilled closer to a location called the 
ice divide, where stresses would have been lower, they say.

C. During both interglacials and ice ages, Earth’s climate has fluctuated violently.
D. During ice ages, Earth’s climate has been highly variable, whereas during interglacials it
has been mild and stable.
E. During interglacials, Earth’s climate has been highly variable, whereas during ice ages it
has been uniformly cold and icy.
4. The passage suggests that which of the following is most likely to have been true of the
oxygen-16 and oxygen-18 isotopes found in the lower sections of the GRIP core?
A. There was significantly more isotope oxygen-18 than isotope oxygen-16 in the ice layers.
B. There was significantly more isotope oxygen-16 than isotope oxygen-18 in the ice layers.
C. Ratios of isotopes oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 varied in the ice layers.
D. Layers containing isotope oxygen-18 placed stress on the layers containing isotope
oxygen-16, possibly distorting them.
E. Isotope oxygen-16, being lighter, was located mainly in the upper layers, whereas
oxygen-18 had settled into the lower layers.

 Passage 28
Early life insurers in the United States found themselves facing the problem of obtaining 
reliable information, as they needed to rely on applicants themselves to provide truthful, 
complete answers to a standard set of questions. In an attempt to personalize the relationship 
between insurers and their individual applicants, firms selected highly respected local citizens 
to act as their agents. These agents were expected to evaluate the appearance of candidates, 
unearth evidence of unhealthy family histories or questionable habits, and attest to the 
respectability of the people writing testimonial letters on an applicant's behalf. In short, the 
initial purpose of the agency system was not to actively solicit customers, but, rather, to 
recreate the glass-bowl mentality associated with small towns or city neighborhoods. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. explain the original function of life insurance agents
B. evaluate the effectiveness of early life insurance agents
C. describe how life insurance was first introduced
D. illustrate how the life insurance agency system changed over time
E. compare the strategies used by life insurance in cities and in small towns
2. The author suggests which of the following about “city neighborhoods”?
A. They were places where family histories were difficult to establish.
B. They were places where unhealthy behaviors had been successfully addressed.
C. They were locations that were well suited for recruiting insurance agents.
D. They offered a high degree of transparency about a resident's personal history and
character.
E. They offered potentially fruitful markets for the life insurance industry.
44


 Passage 29
For years, the leading theory for what caused the Younger Dryas (a dramatic reversal, about 
12,900 years ago, in a global warming trend) was a release of water from Glacial Lake 
Agassiz. The theory posited that this meltwater flooded into the North Atlantic, lowering the 
salinity and intensity of surface waters enough to prevent them from sinking. Ocean currents 
were changed in such a way that northward transport of heat in the ocean diminished, and the 
North Atlantic regions plunged back into near-glacial conditions. However, evidence has 
emerged that the Younger Dryas began long before freshwater flooded the North Atlantic. 
Additionally, the temperature changes induced by a shutdown in the North Atlantic heat 
conveyor system are too small to explain the Younger Dryas. 
1. The author of the passage implies which of the following about the release of water from
glacial Lake Agassiz?
A. The notion that the release occurred has been challenged by more recent findings.
B. The release probably occurred much earlier than scientists have generally assumed.
C. The release would not have been sufficient to cause any temperature change in the North
Atlantic.
D. The timing of the release is such that it probably did not trigger the onset of the Younger
Dryas. E. The release was probably unrelated to the global warming trend that was taking
place.
2. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. presenting evidence that undermines an explanation
B. explaining the nature of a climatological phenomenon
C. questioning the timing of a particular event
D. discussing a new explanation for a phenomenon
E. suggesting revisions to a popular theory
45


 Passage 30
One reason researchers have long believed that Mars never enjoyed an extensive period of 
warm and wet climate is that much of the surface not covered by wind-borne dust appear to be 
composed of unweathered material. If water flowed for an extended period, researchers 
reasoned, it should have altered and weathered the volcanic minerals, creating clays or 
other oxidized, hydrated phases (minerals that incorporate water molecules in their 
crystal structure) .
It turns out, though, that the scientists were not looking closely enough. New high-resolution 
mapping data and close-up surface studies have revealed clays and other hydrated minerals 
in many regions. The clay deposits are scattered all over, in ancient volcanic surfaces and 
heavily cratered highland regions, some of which have apparently been exposed by erosion 
only recently.
1. According to the passage, scientists are able to discover weathered material on the Martian
surface because they have benefited from which of the following?
A. a new method to analyze volcanic craters created on the Martian surface.
B. an improved ability to detect hydrated materials on the Martian surface
C. a more sophisticated understanding of the effect of wind-borne dust on the Martian surface
D. a decision to look for water primarily in heavily cratered highland regions.
E. a better understanding of how erosion might affect clay deposits.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. It can be inferred from the passage that the author would agree with which of the following
statements regarding the reasoning discussed in the highlighted sentence?
A. It provides the basis for an explanation of why water on Mars has been difficult to find until
recently.
B. It correctly identifies a consequence of water flowing on the Martian surface.
C. It depends on a false assumption about how water and volcanic materials interact on Mars.
46


 Passage 31
Scientific consensus is that humans first began to have a warming effect on Earth’s climate 
within the past century, after coal-burning factories, power plants, and motor vehicles began 
releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in significant quantities into the 
air. However, evidence suggests that human agricultural activities may have had such 
an effect much earlier: concentrations of CO2 started rising about 8000 years ago, even 
though natural trends indicate they should have been dropping; methane levels rose similarly 
about 3,000 years later. Without these rises, however, current temperatures in northern parts 
of North America and Europe would be cooler by three to four degrees Celsius-enough to 
inhibit agriculture-and an ice age would probably have begun several thousand years ago in 
northeastern Canada. 
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It undermines the assumption that human activity has had a significant impact on Earth’s
climate
B. It supports the assumption that Earth’s temperatures have risen appreciably over the past
100 years
C. It questions the assumption that greenhouse gases have had a warming effect on Earth's
climate
D. It challenges the assumption that human activity began to affect Earth’s climate after the
advent of industrialization
E. It supports the assumption that greenhouse gases are a direct by-product of industrial
activities
2. The author mentions “natural trends” most likely in order to
A. propose a possible explanation for why current temperatures in North America and Europe
are not as low as they might otherwise be
B. explain why levels of methane in Earth's atmosphere began to rise approximately 5,000
years ago
C. suggest that Earth’s climate would have become even warmer without the advent of human
agricultural activities
D. identify factors that may have contributed to the rise of greenhouse gases in Earth’s
atmosphere approximately 8,000 years ago and again some 3,000 years later
E. support the claim that human activity may have played a role in the rise in CO2 and
methane levels in the atmosphere thousands of years ago
47


 Passage 32
Princessfish are a species of coral-reef fish that are captured alive by divers who first stun the 
individual fish by squirting a certain poison at them. Since the divers limit their catch to a few 
individuals and take care not to overfish, the divers’ continuing activities will clearly not result 
in serious harm to populations of princessfish. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weaken the argument given? 
A. Princessfish cannot be captured alive by traditional methods of fishing.
B. The poison used to stun the princessfish has no effect on humans who eat them.
C. Demand for princessfish has remained steady during the last decade.
D. Traces of the poison that remain in the seawater damage the Corals that create and
maintain the reefs on which princessfish depend.
E. Fish that have been stunned but have selected for capture by the divers soon recover from
the temporary effect of the poison.
48


 Passage 33
A primary value in early twentieth-century Modernist architectural theory was that of “truth to 
materials”, that is, it was essential that a building’s design express the “natural” character of 
the building materials. This emphasis would have puzzled the architects of the Italian 
Renaissance (sixteenth century), a period widely regarded as the apex of architectural 
achievement, for Renaissance architects’ designs were determined only minimally by the 
materials employed. The diversity of Italy’s natural resources provided Renaissance architects 
with a wide variety of building materials. The builders of the Pitti Palace (1558-1570) used 
great blocks of Tuscan stone, just as Etruscans living in the same part of Italy had done some 
twenty centuries earlier. Had the Florentine Renaissance builders aped the Etruscan style, it 
might be said that their materials determined their style, since Etruscan style matched the 
massive, stark, solid character of the stone. But these same materials, which so suited the 
massive Etruscan style, were effectively used by the Florentine Renaissance to create the 
most delicate and graceful of styles. 
A similar example of identical materials used in contrasting styles characterizes the treatment 
of Roman travertine marble. When Baroque architects of seventeenth-century Rome desired a 
massive and solid monumental effect, they turned to travertine marble, whose “natural effect” 
is, indeed, that of spacious breadth and lofty, smoothly rounded surfaces. Yet during the 
Renaissance, this same material had been used against its “nature,” in the Florentine tradition 
of sharply carved detail. Italian Renaissance architecture was shaped less by the “nature” of 
the materials at hand than by the artistic milieu of Renaissance Italy, which included painting 
and sculpture as well as architecture. While Roman travertine marble may have lent itself to 
fine carving, the Florentine passion for fine detail is no less marked in Florentine 
Renaissance painting than in Florentine Renaissance architecture. Similarly, in the next 
century, the emphasis on shading and corporeal density in Baroque painting mirrored the use 
of Roman travertine marble in Baroque architecture to create broad shadow and powerful 
masses. 
The ingenuity of Renaissance architects extended beyond merely using a material in a way not 
suggested by its outward natural appearance. If they conceived a design that called for a 
certain material either too expensive or difficult to work with, they made no scruple about 
imitating that material. Their marbles and their stones are often actually painted stucco. When 
the blocks of masonry with which they built were not in scale with the projected scheme, the 
real joints were concealed and false ones introduced. Nor were these practices confined, as 
some scholars insist, to the later and supposedly decadent phases of the art. Material, then, 
was utterly subservient to style.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. explaining the differences in quality among different kinds of building materials
B. discussing the differences among Etruscan, Florentine Renaissance, and Roman Baroque
architecture
C. describing how different materials influenced architecture in different cities
D. describing the manner in which Renaissance architects often resorted to artificial materials
and illusionistic effects
E. demonstrating the attitude of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italian architects toward
the use of building materials
49


2. It can be inferred from the passage that the author believes that which of the following is
true of painting and architecture of the Baroque era?
A. Both emphasize the “natural” use of materials.
B. Both are derived from the Florentine Renaissance style.
C. Both have been overlooked by twentieth-century Modernists.
D. They have certain visual features in common.
E. They illustrate the degeneration of a style.
3. The author’s mention of Florentine Renaissance painting serves in the context of the
passage to support which of the following assertions?
A. The constraints that operate in architecture are different from those that operate in painting
B. Florentine architectural style was not determined by the nature of the available marble.
C. The Florentine Renaissance period was a period in which the other arts achieved the same
distinction as did architecture.
D. Technical advances in all of the arts of the Florentine Renaissance determined the stylistic
qualities of those arts.
E. Native preferences of style do not manifest themselves in the same ways in different arts.
4. The passage suggests which of the following about the cited “scholars”?
A. They believe that a decadent phase is characteristic of any significant artistic movement.
B. They reject the popular view of the Renaissance as the apex of architectural achievement.
C. They believe that a vigorous and healthy architecture would not usually employ false
surfaces or imitation building materials.
D. They represent the mainstream in critical and historical thought about the Florentine
Renaissance.
E. They have focused on such technical matters as the cost of building materials rather than
on artistic concerns.

 Passage 34
Archaeologists studying Bonito phase (ca. A.D. 900-1140) Native American ceramics from 
Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, observed that many pots had been altered after firing to revise 
their decorative designs--usually, intricate geometric patterns painted in black on white slipped 
surfaces. In some cases, a new design was imposed over an earlier one; less often, the 
original design was simply covered with white slip. Crown and Wills doubt that the alterations 
were made to correct design errors. Many Chaco pots with design errors were left unaltered. 
Furthermore, when errors were corrected, revisions were made prior to firing—either by 
painting directly over the error or by scraping off designs and applying new slip and paint, 
which is a less time-consuming method than repainting and refiring flawed pots. 
1. The author of the passage mentions Crown and Wills primarily in order to
A. Distinguish among different factors that might have caused Chaco potters to alter their pots’
decorative designs.
B. Introduce new evidence related to the question of why Chaco potters altered their pots’
decorative designs.
C. Show how one potential explanation for the alteration of Chaco pots has been discounted.
D. Present a hypothesis about why Chaco pots were altered to revise their decorative designs.
E. Explain how archaeologists discerned the method by which Chaco pots were originally
decorated.
2. According to the passage, which of the following is true of Bonito phase Chaco pots?
A. Relatively few of them have original designs concealed beneath white surfaces.
B. Relatively few of them were altered after firing.
C. Many of their alterations increased the intricacy of their painted designs.
D. Many of them have some flaw in their shape or structure.
E. Many of them were altered more than once.
51


 Passage 35
Architectural morphology is the study of how shifting cultural and environmental conditions 
produce changes in an architectural form. When applied to the mission churches of New 
Mexico exemplifying seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Spanish colonial architecture in 
what is now the southwestern United States, architectural morphology reveals much about 
how Native American culture transformed the traditional European church architecture of the 
Spanish missionaries who hoped to convert Native Americans to Christianity.
Many studies of these mission churches have carefully documented the history and design of 
their unique architectural form, most attribute the churches’ radical departure from their 
sixteenth-century European predecessors to local climate and a less-mechanized building 
technology. Certainly, the limitations imposed by manual labor and the locally available 
materials of mud-brick and timber necessitated a divergence from the original European 
church model. However, the emergence of a church form suited to life in the Southwest was 
rooted in something more fundamental than material and technique. The new architecture 
resulted from cultural forces in both the Spanish colonial and indigenous Native American 
societies, each with competing ideas about form and space and different ways of conveying 
these ideas symbolically. 
For example, the mission churches share certain spatial qualities with the indigenous kiva,a 
round, partly subterranean room used by many Southwest Native American communities for 
important rituals. Like the kiva it was intended to replace, the typical mission church had thick 
walls of adobe (sun-dried earth and straw), a beaten-earth floor, and one or two small 
windows. In deference to European custom, the ceilings of these churches were higher than 
those of the traditional kiva. However, with the limited lighting afforded by their few small 
windows, these churches still suggest the kiva's characteristically low, boxlike, earth-hugging 
interior. Thus, although pragmatic factors of construction may have contributed to the shape of 
the mission churches, as earlier studies suggest, the provision of a sacred space consistent 
with indigenous traditions may also have been an important consideration in their design. 
The continued viability of the kiva itself in Spanish mission settlements has also been 
underestimated by historians. Freestanding kivas discovered in the ruins of European-style 
missionary communities have been explained by some historians as examples of 
“superposition”. Under this theory, Christian domination over indigenous faiths is dramatized 
by surrounding the kiva with Christian buildings. However, as James Ivey points out, such 
superposition was unlikely, since historical records indicate that most Spanish missionaries, 
arriving in the Southwest with little or no military support, wisely adopted a somewhat 
conciliatory attitude toward the use of the kiva at least initially. This fact, and the careful, 
solitary placement of the kiva in the center of the mission-complex courtyards, suggests an 
intention to highlight the importance of the kiva rather than to diminish it.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. correct some misinterpretations about the development of an architectural form
B. compare the traditional church architectures of two different cultures
C. examine the influence of a religious architectural style on secular buildings
D. explain the nature of the contrast between two different architectural styles
E. trace the European roots of an architectural style used in the United Stales
52


2. The passage suggests that the indicated historians regarded the placement of kivas in the
midst of Christian buildings as which of the following?
A. exemplary of an arrangement of religious buildings typical of a kind of Native American
architecture common prior to the arrival of the Spanish
B. largely responsible for the evolution of a distinctive Spanish mission architectural style
C. indicative of the Spanish missionaries’ desire to display an attitude of acceptance toward
the kiva
D. symbolic of the controversy among Spanish missionaries in New Mexico regarding their
treatment of the indigenous population
E. reflective of the Spanish missionary’s desire to diminish the kiva's importance
3. Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument about the Spanish
missionaries’ attitude toward the kiva?
A. The period of most intensive settlement by Spanish missionaries in the Southwest occurred
before the period in which the mission churches of New Mexico were built.
B. There are no traces of kivas in Spanish mission settlements that were protected by a large
military presence.
C. Little of the secular Spanish colonial architecture of the Southwest of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries is predominantly European in style.
D. Some Spanish missionary communities of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were
attached to Spanish military installations.
E. New Mexico contains by far the largest concentration of Spanish mission-style church
architecture in the United States.
4. According to the passage, the building techniques prevailing in the Southwest during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries played a role in which of the following?
A. preventing missionaries in the Southwest from duplicating traditional European churches
B. influencing missionaries in the Southwest to incorporate a freestanding kiva into certain
mission settlements
C. causing missionaries in the Southwest to limit the building of churches to New Mexico only
D. jeopardizing the viability of Spanish religious settlements throughout the Southwest
E. encouraging many missionaries in the Southwest to reexamine the continued viability of a
highly ceremonial European religious tradition
53


 Passage 36
Astronomers have had difficulty accounting for certain planets discovered outside our solar 
system. They are called hot Jupiters because each is similar in mass to Jupiter, the largest 
solar-system planet, but orbits its parent star at a fraction of the distance at which Earth, let 
alone Jupiter, orbits the Sun. In the standard, solar-system-based theory of planetary 
formation, such a massive planet could not form so close to a star. So most attempts to 
explain a hot Jupiter’s existence envision it forming farther away, then migrating inward. 
According to one hypothesis, the planet’s gravitational field tugs on the protoplanetary disk of 
dust and gas from which it formed. The disk exerts its own gravitational tug, and this interplay 
of forces robs the planet of momentum in its orbital path, forcing it to spiral in toward the star. 
According to another hypothesis, the planet’s gravitational field is so strong that it creates a 
groove in the disk, partitioning it into inner and outer regions; the resulting gravitational 
interactions between the planet and these regions cause the planet to lose orbital momentum 
and spiral inward. Another question remains: what prevents the planet from continuing its 
spiral until it collides with the star? 
1. The author of the passage mentions “Earth” primarily in order to
A.stress the massive size of a hot Jupiter
B.emphasize the proximity of a hot Jupiter to its parent star
C.imply that hot Jupiters are unlikely to harbor extraterrestrial life
D.point out differences between Earth and Jupiter with regard to their orbital distance from the
Sun
E. illustrate how hot Jupiters might fit into the standard theory of planetary formation
2. Which of the following elements is part of one but not both of the hypotheses discussed in
the passage?
A. an interplay of gravitational forces
B. a loss of orbital momentum
C. a protoplanetary disk composed of dust and gas
D. a protoplanetary disk divided into two regions.
3. It can be inferred from the passage that the “attempts” share which of the following goals?
A. to explain how a Jupiter-sized planet could form so close to its parent star.
B. to explain what prevents a hot Jupiter from colliding with its parent star.
C. to determine whether a hot Jupiter is formed from a protoplanetary disk of dust and gas.
D. to determine whether a hot Jupiter’s gravitational field is strong enough to create a groove
in its protoplantary disk
E. to account for hot Jupiters in a way that is not inconsistent with the standard theory of
planetary formation.
54


 Passage 37
Because the subject matter was so personal, the work of several prominent mid-twentieth 
century poets has been termed “confessional” poetry. But confession is a bad metaphor for 
what those poets did. The motive for confession is penitential or therapeutic—by speaking 
openly about personal guilt and suffering, the poet hopes to make them easier to bear. But 
these poets always approached their writing as artists, and their motive was aesthetic. Writing 
from experiences like madness, despair, and lust, their aim was to make effective art, not to 
cure themselves. To treat their poems mainly as documents of personal experience is not just 
to diminish the poets’ achievement, but to ignore their unanimous disdain for the idea of 
confessional poetry. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. The author of the passage suggests that applying the term “confessional” to the work of the
poets discussed
A. is mistaken in what it seems to imply about the poets’ motivation
B. might seem superficially appropriate given the subject matter of the poems
C. is an error arising from the absence of any other convenient term.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. The passage implies that the poets discussed did NOT
A. think that a poet’s motivation for writing was relevant in evaluating that poet’s work
B. experience any relief of their personal suffering as a result of writing
C. apply to their own work the label by which it has subsequently been know
55


 Passage 38
Astronomers who study planet formation once believed that comets—because they remain 
mostly in the distant Oort cloud, where temperatures are close to absolute zero—must be 
pristine relics of the material that formed the outer planets. The conceptual shift away from 
seeing comets as pristine relics began in the 1970s, when laboratory simulations revealed 
there was sufficient ultraviolet radiation reaching comets to darken their surfaces and there 
were sufficient cosmic rays to alter chemical bonds or even molecular structure near the 
surface. Nevertheless, astronomers still believed that when a comet approached the Sun—
where they could study it—the Sun’s intense heat would remove the corrupted surface layer, 
exposing the interior. About the same time, though, scientists realized comets might contain 
decaying radioactive isotopes that could have warmed cometary interiors to temperatures that 
caused the interiors to evolve. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. According to the passage, astronomers recognize which of the following as being liable to
cause changes to comets?
A. cosmic rays
B. radioactive decay
C. ultraviolet radiation
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. According to the passage, astronomers’ belief that comets are pristine relics was
A. overturned by analysis of what happens when comets approach the Sun
B. supported by what observations revealed about the composition of the outer planets
C. based on consideration of the conditions that prevail where comets are located
3. The author suggests that the realization described in the ﬁnal sentence of the passage had
which of the following effects?
A. It introduced a new topic for study by astronomers interested in planetary formation.
B. It led astronomers to adopt a number of different strategies in trying to determine the
composition of cometary interiors.
C. It called into question an assumption that astronomers had made about comets.
D. It cast doubt on astronomers’ ability to study the interior parts of comets,
E. It caused astronomers to revise their account of the composition of the outer planets.
4. It can be inferred that the author would agree with which of the following statements about the
“laboratory simulations”?
A. The simulations showed that despite the low temperatures in the Oort cloud, there was sufﬁcient
energy there to alter comets.
B. Astronomers were initially reluctant to accept what simulations showed about the composition of
comets.
C. The simulations themselves did not eliminate the possibility that comets contain pristine relics of
material from the early solar system.

 Passage 39
Biologists studying wild monkeys sometimes need the genetic material DNA from a particular 
monkey to determine the animal's parentage. Until recently, DNA could be extracted only from 
blood. Collecting a blood sample required tranquilizing the donor animal. Now DNA can be 
extracted from hair. Monkeys shed large quantities of hair in places where they sleep. 
Therefore, researchers will now be able to determine the parentage of individual monkeys 
from DNA without tranquilizing the monkeys. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
A. The places in which monkeys sleep are easily accessible to researchers.
B. Information about a particular monkey’s parentage is the only kind of information that can
be determined from DNA that has been extracted from that monkey’s hair.
C. For at least some samples of hair collected from monkey habitat it will be possible to
associate hairs with the individual monkeys from which they came.
D. Examining DNA is the only way to determine the parentage of wild monkeys.
E. It will be necessary to obtain any hair samples used in determining a monkey’s parentage
from a place where the monkey has slept.
Passage 40
Buell’s study of village sketches (a type of fiction popular in the United States in the 1830s and 
1840s) provides a valuable summary of sketches that portray the community as homogeneous 
and fixed, but it ignores those by women writers, which typically depicted the diversity that 
increasingly characterized actual village communities at that time. These women’s 
geographical mobility was restricted (although women writers of the time were not uniformly 
circumscribed in this way), and their subject matter reflected this fact. Yet their texts were 
enriched by what Gilligan, writing in a different context, has called the ability to attend to 
voices other than one’s own. To varying degrees, the women’s sketches portray differences 
among community members: all stress differences among men and among women 
(particularly the latter) as well as differences between the sexes, and some also depict cultural 
diversity. These writers represent community as dynamic, as something that must be 
negotiated and renegotiated because of its members’ divergent histories, positions, 
expectations, and beliefs.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. According to the passage, village sketches written by women in the United States in the
1830s and 1840s typically reflected
A. the negotiations that characterized trade relationships between villages
B. the fact that these women did not often travel very far beyond their own village
C. the plurality of experiences and ideas that existed among the residents of a village
2. Select the sentence in the passage that contrasts how men and women depicted life in
village communities.
3. The passage indicates that when Gilligan spoke of “the ability to attend to voices other than
one’s own,” she
A. did not consider that ability to be a desirable psychological characteristic
B. did not believe that individuals differ greatly with respect to that ability
C. was implying that that ability enhances a sense of belonging in communities
D. was assuming that good writers are able to depict diverse characters
E. was not discussing the women who wrote village sketches
57


 Passage 41
By far the most popular United States literature of its time was a body of now-neglected novels 
written between 1820 and 1870 by, for, and about women. According to Nina Baym, who has 
termed this genre “woman’s fiction,” the massive popularity of these novels claimed a place for 
women in the writing profession. The novels chronicle the experiences of women who, beset 
with hardships, find within themselves qualities of intelligence, will, resourcefulness, and 
courage sufficient to overcome their obstacles. According to Baym, the genre began with 
Catharine Sedgwick’s New-England Tale (1822), manifested itself as the best-selling reading 
matter of the American public in the unprecedented sales of Susan Warner’s Wide, Wide 
World (1850), and remained a dominant fictional type until after 1870. The critical, as opposed 
to popular, reception of these novels in their own time was mixed. Theoretical opposition by 
those who saw fiction as a demoralizing and corrupting influence was by no means dead in 
mid-nineteenth-century America, and popular successes naturally bore a significant proportion 
of the attack. The moralistic tone of much woman’s fiction did not placate these antagonists; 
on the contrary, many clerical opponents of the novel thought that women were trying to take 
over the clergy’s functions and hence attacked all the more fiercely. Similarly, some male 
authors, disgruntled by the emergence of great numbers of women writers, expressed 
contempt for the genre. 
On the other hand, the women had a powerful ally—their publishers, who not only put these 
works into print but advertised them widely and enthusiastically. Some few reviewers wrote 
about these works with attention and respect, distinguishing between the works of the different 
authors and identifying individual strengths and weaknesses. These approving contemporary 
critics were particularly alert to each writer’s contribution to the depiction of American social 
life, especially to regional differences in manners and character types. On the whole, however, 
even these laudatory critics showed themselves uninterested in the stories that this fiction told, 
or in their significance. 
Baym acknowledges that these novels are telling—with variations--a single familiar tale, and 
correctly notes that this apparent lack of artistic innovation has been partly responsible for 
their authors’ exclusion from the canon of classic American writers traditionally studied in 
university literature courses. Baym points out, however, that unlike such male contemporaries 
as Nathaniel Hawthorne, these women did not conceive of themselves as “artists,” but rather 
as professional writers with work to do and a living to be made from fulfilling an obligation to 
their audience. This obligation included both entertainment and instruction, which are not, says 
Baym, at odds with one another in these books, nor is entertainment the sweet coating on a 
didactic pill. Rather, the lesson itself is an entertainment: the central character’s triumph over 
adversity is profoundly pleasurable to those readers who identify with her. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. summarizing the major contributions of two influential writers
B. describing and commenting on a group of literary works
C. summarizing the major events of a period of literary history
D. contrasting two types of literary works from the same era
E. arguing for the adopting of several neglected literary works into university curriculums
2. The author of the passage cites Susan Warner’s Wide, Wide World most probably as an
example of a woman’s novel that
A. had more advanced artistic elements than many of its type
B. attracted an excessive amount of critical attention
C. was found to be inappropriately moralistic by many members of the clergy
D. was significant as an indicator of the genre’s popularity
E. signaled the gradual decline of the size of the genre’s audience
58


3. The author of the passage implies which of the following about the members of the clergy
mentioned in the first paragraph?
A. They also opposed works of fiction that were outside the genre of woman’s fiction.
B. They opposed journalism as well as imaginative writing.
C. Their influence reached its pinnacle in the mid-nineteenth century.
D. They were unable to obtain the support of other critics for their views.
E. Their attacks on the genre of the novel did not extend to novels written by male writers.
4. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage concerning the majority of the
nineteenth-century reviewers of woman’s fiction?
A. They considered the position taken by the clergy in regard to woman’s fiction self-serving.
B. They did not make fine distinctions between different authors.
C. They placed a higher value on plot than on social significance.
D. They subscribed to the view of writers as purveyors of popular entertainment rather than as
artists
E. They regarded woman’s fiction as high as publishers did
59


 Passage 42
Carolina Hospital notes that Cuban-American writers who write primarily in English are 
dismissed from anthologies and analyses of Cuban exile literature on that account. She 
argues that since these writers were born in Cuba and consider themselves Cuban writers, 
they should not be ignored, and maintains that they represent a new phase of Cubanness, one 
that is expressed in the language comfortable to its writers—English. Moreover, another critic 
notes that the Spanish and English traditions of Cuban-American writing have different but 
equally viable functions. The English branch seeks to create a distinctive culture of Cuban 
roots in the United States, whereas the Spanish branch wishes to preserve a specifically 
Cuban culture while seeking affiliation with the canon of Latin American letters.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. Hospital, as presented in the passage, would probably agree with which of the following
statements about Cuban-American writing?
A. For Cuban-American writers, writing in English is not irreconcilable with Cuban identity.
B. All Cuban-American writers are generally recognized as contributing to Cuban exile
literature.
C. It is appropriate for anthologies of Cuban exile literature to include works written both in
Spanish and in English.
2. In the context in which it appears, “comfortable” most nearly means
A. prosperous
B. sufficient
C. agreeable
D. restful
E. painless

 Passage 43
Constant variations in the amount of sunlight available on Earth at any given location make 
energy storage a necessary design feature of terrestrial solar-energy systems. For systems 
transforming solar to thermal energy, the thermal energy may be stored in matter as either 
latent heat or sensible heat. Latent heat is absorbed or released whenever matter changes 
phase, as when matter changes from liquid to gas, for example, or from gas to liquid. Large 
heat capacities are associated with certain materials, like salts, but in any substance this 
storage is available only at the unique fixed temperature at which the particular phase 
transition occurs in that substance. Moreover, materials that have transitions at the 
temperatures that terrestrial solar-energy systems are likely to encounter are usually 
destructively corrosive at those temperatures. The storage of sensible heat, on the other hand, 
allows flexibility as to temperature, in addition, safe substances like water and most rocks 
have large sensible heat capacities. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to discuss which of the following?
A. reasons for the necessity for developing solar-energy systems
B. different ways of storing solar energy as heat
C. new designs for devices that collect solar energy
D. procedures for transferring thermal energy between materials
E. differences between capacities of solids and liquids to store sensible heat
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. According to the passage, solar-energy systems located on Earth must store energy for
which of the following reasons?
A.At any given location on Earth, the amount of sunlight available frequently changes.
B.The operation of such systems depends on devices that require a power source other than
solar energy
C. Demand for the energy produced by such systems varies in unpredictable ways
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
3.The author suggests that which of the following constitutes a potential disadvantage of using
latent heat for energy storage?
A. The circumstances under which phase transitions occur would limit the versatility of latent
heat as a storage method.
B. The supply of substances that possess the properties that are needed in a medium for
latent heat storage is dwindling.
C. The properties that are needed in a medium for latent heat storage are found in substances
that have other, undesirable properties.
61


 Passage 44
Exotic insect pests can produce both short-and long-term effects on forest ecosystems. Short-
term effects include the disturbances directly associated with the action of the pest, which may 
cause the defoliation, loss of vigor, or death of trees. Long-term effects are primarily mediated 
by changes in tree species composition and the consequent alterations of forest structure, 
productivity, and nutrient uptake. Exotic pests are more efficient than most abiotic 
disturbances (e.g., fire or wind) at producing long-term changes in species composition. Pests 
often target specific tree species and, if they become established, they usually remain as 
permanent components of the ecosystem. Shifts in forest species composition ramify through 
the ecosystem in many ways because tree species have different, often unique properties. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1.The passage mentions which of the following as effects of exotic pests on forest
ecosystems?
A. decreased vitality in trees
B. defoliation of trees
C. changes in forest structure
2. The author of the passage mentions the “unique properties” of tree species primarily in
order to help explain
A. why pests tend to target specific tree species
B. why pests can have long-term effects on entire ecosystems
C. how pests contribute to shifts in forest species composition
D. how pests are able to become established in an ecosystem
E. how some tree species are able to withstand the effects of pests
Passage 45
For centuries, oak was the wood of choice for European shipbuilders. However, toward the 
end of the eighteenth century, as British oak supplies grew scarce, shipbuilders there turned 
to teak and found in it an ideal substitute. Other woods expand and contract at different rates 
than oak, so repairs to oak ships done with those woods split or leak. Only teak matches oak’s 
expansion coefficient and stays watertight. It is unmatched in its resistance to rot and pests, 
and its oils even protect nails against corrosion. Moreover, it was one of two important tropical 
hardwoods (with Central American mahogany) that dried light enough to float downriver--the 
only way to transport timber in quantity from the inland jungles where it grew. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. It can be inferred from the passage that an advantage of teak over mahogany is that teak is:
A. more compatible with the materials in existing ships.
B. less susceptible to rot and pests
C. available in greater quantities in inland jungles
2. In the context in which it appears, ‘turned to” most nearly means
A. rotated
B. resorted to
C. deflected from
D. reverted to
E. revolved around
62


 Passage 46
For the first time, funding for designing experiments to be conducted during space flights has 
been made available by the government space program to university biologists not already 
employed by the space program. From the fact that little interest has been expressed in this 
offer, however, it cannot be concluded that virtually the only biologists interested in research 
that such experiments could address are those biologists already employed by the space 
program, since _____. 
Which of the following most logically completes the argument given? 
A. relatively few of the biologists already employed by the space program have ever held
university positions
B. there are more research biologists in industry than at universities
C. biologists are not the only scientists interested in research that could be furthered by the
opportunity to conduct experiments in space
D. the space program employs only a small percentage of the research biologists employed by
the government
E. much of the biological research currently funded by the government’s space program is
concerned with the biological effects of a weightless environment
Passage 47
From the 1880s to the 1930s, the textile industry in Japan employed over half of all workers, 
most of them in the three major branches of silk reeling, cotton spinning, and weaving. 
Because the branches were highly diverse—in scale, skill requirements, and technology—
historians traditionally have analyzed them separately. However, the workforces of all three 
were drawn primarily from the same population: young, mostly rural women aged 10 to 25. 
Noting this commonality, Hunter argues that a consideration of the three branches of 
production together is long overdue: examining elements common to the different branches of 
textile production may, she asserts, permit the identification of gender-based factors that may 
have influenced the operation of the Japanese female labor market as a whole. 
1. Which of the following does the passage cite as an explanation for historians’ traditional
analysis of the Japanese textile industry?
A. a common workforce population across all branches of textile manufacturing
B. similarities in the skills required for silk reeling, cotton spinning, and weaving
C. the importance of the textile industry to the Japanese economy as a whole
D. the high number of female factory workers employed within the textile industry
E. differences in the technology used in the three major branches of textile production
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. It can be inferred that Hunter regards which of the following to be a shortcoming of
historians’ traditional analyses discussed in the passage?
A. their failure to examine factors common to the three different branches of Japanese textile
production
B. their separation of the Japanese textile industry into three major branches based on
differences in scale, skill requirements, and technology
C. their failure to acknowledge the contribution made by rural women to the different branches
of the textile industry
63


 Passage 48
When studying shrimp feeding from hydro-thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, biologists 
were surprised that the shrimps’ reproductive cycles followed seasonal patterns. Far beyond 
the reach of sunlight, and with food abundant around the vents all year round, why should 
such animals reproduce seasonally? The answer might involve their offspring, which in their 
larval form drift in the currents to colonize new vents. The larvae must feed during their trip, 
and their springtime release coincides with a peak in algae raining down from surface waters. 
So far, researchers have found no evidence of seasonal breeding among vent-dwelling 
species that provide their offspring with yolk to sustain them or among vent-dwelling 
species found in areas of the ocean with not seasonal algae blooms.
Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It casts doubt on the accuracy of earlier observations of seasonal breeding among shrimp
species living near hydro-thermal vents.
B. It undermines the explanation proposed for seasonal breeding among some shrimp species
living near hydro-thermal vents.
C. It suggests that alternative theories are needed to explain seasonal breeding among shrimp
species living near hydro-thermal vents.
D. It describes the survival benefits to shrimp of mating in parts of the ocean where algae
blooms rain down abundantly.
E. It supports the explanation proffered for the seasonal breeding observed among some
shrimp species living near hydro-thermal vents.
64


 Passage 49
There is mounting evidence that the frequency and magnitude of landsliding is changing in 
many parts of the world in response to climate change. This is not surprising, given that 
precipitation is one of the two external triggering mechanisms--the other being seismic 
activity--involved in the formation of landslides. Evidence from the past clearly indicates that 
cycles of elevated landslide activity have been followed by cycles of low activity, and that 
these are correlated with climate fluctuations over a variety of timescales.
What sets current changes in landslide activity apart is the likely influence of anthropogenic 
[i.e., human-caused] factors, either acting alone or in concert with climate, which can further 
modify the process of landsliding and the nature of ecosystem responses. Among these 
factors, deforestation and land-use change have the potential to influence the frequency and 
magnitude of landsliding because of their direct effects on vegetation attributes that influence 
slope stability. The extent and conditions under which mountain ecosystems are resilient to 
these changes--that is, the amount of disturbance they can absorb before changing into states 
with different structure and function--are not known. Addressing this issue is crucial for the 
long-term conservation of mountainscapes.
1. The author of the passage cites “evidence from the past” in order to
A. support a partial explanation
B. concede a potential objection
C. dismiss an apparent counterexample
D. highlight a scientific consensus
E. account for a historical anomaly
2. The passage makes which of the following claims?
A. A rise in precipitation resulting from human factors has increased the frequency and
magnitude of landsliding.
B. Human factors have led to greater changes in landsliding activity than have cyclical climate
fluctuations.
C. Decreases in landsliding activity have historically been accompanied by changes in climate.
D. Slope stability is more influenced by seismic activity than it is by human factors
E. Changes in land-use patterns in mountain ecosystems are generally correlated with
changes in climate.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
3. The author of the passage suggests which of the following about the role of human factors
in landsliding activity?
A. Human factors can intensify or alter the effects of climate change on landsliding activity.
B. It is likely that human factors affect landsliding activity more than climate change does.
C. Until recently, human factors did not have much impact on landsliding activity.
65


 Passage 50
There have been numerous well-documented extinctions of indigenous species caused by the 
introduction of non-indigenous predators and pathogens. However, surprisingly few extinctions 
of indigenous species can be attributed to competition from introduced species. For example, 
during the past 400 years, 4,000 plant species have been introduced into North America, and 
these non-indigenous plants currently account for nearly 20 percent of North America’s plant 
species. Yet no evidence exists that any indigenous North American plant species became 
extinct as a result of competition from new species could mean that such extinctions take 
longer to occur than scientists initially believed or, alternatively, that extinctions are rarely 
caused by competition from non-indigenous species.
1. The passage is concerned primarily with
A. pointing out that a particular type of species extinction is rarely known to occur.
B. proposing a possible explanation for conflicting data about a particular type of species
extinction.
C. resolving a debate about the frequency of a particular type of species extinction.
D. comparing two theories regarding possible causes of a particular type of species extinction.
E. refuting a proposed explanation for the increasingly rare occurrence of a particular type of
species extinction.
2. The author introduces statistics about North America’s non-indigenous plant species
primarily in order to
A. undermine a proposed explanation for the absence of any evidence for the occurrence of a
particular phenomenon
B. contrast the effect of introduced plant species in North America with the effect that
introduced animal species have had
C. suggest that North America’s indigenous plants are a domain in which there has been
ample scope for a particular effect to have occurred
D. emphasize how much the ecology of North America has been affected over the past 400
years by the introduction of non-indigenous species
E. substantiate a claim about the overall effect that the introduction of non-indigenous species
tends to have on indigenous populations
66


 Passage 51
The relevance of the literary personality—a writer’s distinctive attitudes, concerns, and artistic 
choices—to the analysis of a literary work is being scrutinized by various schools of 
contemporary criticism. Deconstructionists view the literary personality, like the writer’s 
biographical personality, as irrelevant. The proper focus of literary analysis, they argue, is a 
work’s intertextuality( interrelationship with other texts), subtexts (unspoken, concealed, or 
repressed discourses), and metatexts (self-referential aspects), not a perception of a writer’s 
verbal and aesthetic “fingerprints.” New historicists also devalue the literary personality, since, 
in their emphasis on a work’s historical contexts, they credit a writer with only those insights 
and ideas that were generally available when the writer lived. However, to readers interested 
in literary detective work--say scholars of classical( Greek and Roman) literature who wish to 
reconstruct damaged texts or deduce a work’s authorship—the literary personality sometimes 
provides vital clues.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. discussing attitudes toward a particular focus for literary analysis
B. describing the limitations of two contemporary approaches to literary analysis
C. pointing out the similarities among seemingly contrasting approaches to literary analysis
D. defending the resurgence of a particular focus for literary analysis
E. defining a set of related terms employed in literary criticism
For the following question, consider each of the choice separately and select all that apply.
2. It can be inferred from the passage that on the issue of how to analyze a literary work, the
new historicists would most likely agree with the deconstructionists that
A. The writer’s insights and ideas should be understood in terms of the writer’s historical
context.
B. The writer’s literary personality has little or no relevance.
C. The critic should primarily focus on intertextuality, subtexts and metatexts.
3. In the context in which it appears, “credit writer with” most nearly means
A. trust a writer with
B. applaud a writer for
C. believe a writer created
D. presume a writer had
E. accept a writer for
67


 Passage 52
The physicist Wallace Sabine pioneered the scientific study of architectural acoustics when he 
was asked in 1895 to fix a university lecture hall in which the echo of a speaker’s words 
rendered them unintelligible. He found that the length of time it takes a sound’s echo to decay 
is determined by the absorption of the sound’s original energy by surrounding material. By 
hanging panels of sound-absorbing felt on the walls, Sabine reduced the echo enough to make 
the hall usable. And the data he compiled yielded a mathematical formula for the relationship 
between a room’s echo duration, its quantity and quality of sound-absorbing materials, and its 
spatial volume.
1. Which of the following can be inferred about the ‘university lecture hall’ mentioned in the
passage?
A. It was not originally designed to be used for lecture.
B. It was more suitable for listening to music than for listening to the spoken word.
C. Its walls had surfaces made of material with very poor sound-absorbing properties.
D. Its poor acoustics resulted from its being designed to accommodate a large audience.
E. It was constructed at a time when sound-absorbing building materials were not readily
available.
2. The passage suggests that Sabine’s work made which of the following possible for the first
time?
A. to make a room soundproof
B. to build an auditorium out of sound-absorbing materials
C. to construct an enclosed space in which sound would not echo
D. to design a building to meet predetermined specifications with regard to echo duration
E. to render any large room usable for public lectures and performances
68


 Passage 53
The manuscripts of the eight extant Latin tragedies identify the plays as the Marci Lucii Annei 
Senecae Tragoediae. Since nobody of that name is known, modern scholars believe the 
dramasto be the work of Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, the well-known philosopher, 
orator and politician. Clearly the tragedies were written during Seneca’s lifetime: internal 
references to earlier poets, most notably Ovid, indicate that the dramas cannot have been 
composed prior to the second decade C.E., and the plays must have been written by 96C.E., 
when Quintilian quotes Medea, one of the tragedies.
It is remarkably, however, that Seneca himself never mentions the plays, since there are 
certain passages in them that could be used to illustrate points of his philosophy. There are at 
least two possible explanations. In the early Roman Empire, playwrights were sometimes 
exiled or executed for line constructed as directed against the emperor; thus, Seneca’s silence 
may be simple prudence. But if anyone could safely attach his name to dramas, surely it would 
be Seneca, the emperor’s tutor. And although Herrmann offers Seneca’s modesty as an 
explanation, Seneca is not averse to referring to his other writings. The evidence for equating 
Seneca with the author of the tragedies seems circumstantial.
1. The author mentions Medea primarily in order to
A. give an example of a play in which references to certain authors can be used to determine
when the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae were composed
B. acknowledge the possibility that the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae may have been
written by Quintilian rather than Seneca
C. suggest that certain of the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae may have been written
near the end of Seneca’s lifetime
D. argue that Marci may have been one of the last of the eight plays in the Marci Lucii Annei
Senecae Tragoediae to be written
E. indicate how the latest possible date for the time period during which the Marci Lucii Annei
Senecae Tragordiae were composed might be established
2. The author of the passage makes which of the following claims about the eight extant Latin
tragedies?
A. There is only circumstantial evidence that the plays were all written by the same author.
B. Scholars have persistently attributed the plays to Seneca despite evidence that some of
them may have been composed prior to his lifetime.
C. Evidence in the manuscripts of the plays identifies them as having been written by Lucius
Annaeus Seneca the Younger.
D. The plays contain some lines that have been construed as being directed against the
emperor.
E. The plays contain material that could illustrate certain aspects of Seneca’s philosophy.
3. The author of the passage would  most likely agree that if Seneca had in fact written the
tragedies, then Seneca probably would have
A. used the plays as platforms for his philosophical ideas
B. referred to the plays in some of his other writings
C. been in danger of exile or execution for certain line in the plays
D. avoided attaching his name to be the plays out of modesty
E. written the plays during the latter portion of his lifetime
69


4. The author implies which of the following about Seneca’s status as the emperor’s tutor?
A. It enabled Seneca to illustrate points of his philosophy to the leaders of the early Roman
Empire.
B. It had more of an effect on Seneca’s career as a dramatist than it did on his career as a
philosopher, orator, and politician.
C. It might have offered Seneca some protection from certain dangers playwrights typically
faced.
D. It required Seneca to avoid making references to his various writings.
E. It required that Seneca take particular care that his writings could not be construed as being
directed against the emperor.
5. Each of the following assertions consistent with Seneca’s authorship of the plays appears in
the passage EXCEPT
A. There is no known author by the name to which the plays are attributed.
B. Playwrights in the early Roman Empire were politically vulnerable.
C. There are references in the play to Ovid.
D. There are references in the plays to Seneca’s philosophical works.
E. There are quotations from the plays in the works of Quintilian.
Passage 54
The discovery of subsurface life on Earth, surviving independently from surface life, refuted 
the belief that biological processes require not only liquid water but sunlight as well, thus 
greatly enhancing the possibility of life beyond Earth. Take Jupiter’s moon Europa. Space 
probes show a body covered with a thick layer of ice. As Europa orbits its planet, however, it 
flexes due to the gravitational tug-of-war between it,its sister moons, and Jupiter. Through 
friction, this flexing produces heat in the moon’s interior capable of melting ice. Indeed, 
observations suggest liquid water exists beneath Europa’s icy crust. Photosynthetic life is 
impossible there because sunlight is completely absent, but life such as the microbes that 
flourish deep within earth may still be possible.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply
1. Life on Europa in the form suggested in the passage would be dependent on
A. the protection Europa’s icy crust gives against the harmful components of sunlight
B. the existence of water on Europa
C. the motion of Europa around Jupiter
2. The highlighted sentence “take Jupiter’s moon Europa” serves to introduce
A. an instance that allows a hypothesis to be tested
B. speculation grounded in empirical discovery
C. a deduction from a newly advanced hypothesis
D. a large-scale effect of an apparently insignificant contingency
E. the derivation of a contradiction to refute a claim

 Passage 55
Some historians have recently challenged the “party period paradigm,” the view, advanced by 
McCormick and others, that political parties—especially the two major parties—in the United 
States between the years 1835 and 1900 evoked extraordinary loyalty from voters and 
dominated political life. Voss-Hubbard cites the frequency of third-party eruptions during the 
period as evidence of popular antipathy to the two-party regime. He correctly credits third 
parties with helping generate the nineteenth century’s historically high rates of voter turnout by 
forcing major parties to bolster supporters’ allegiance, lest minor parties siphon off their votes, 
and with pushing policy demands that the majorparties ignored. Formisano stresses the 
pervasive record of nonpartisan and anti-party governance at the local level, and women’ s 
frequent participation in nineteenth-century public life, prior to their enfranchisement, in 
nonpartisan and antiparty ways as evidence of the limitations of the party period paradigm. Yet 
McCormick would deny that the existence of antiparty sentiment during the period undermined 
the paradigm, since he has always acknowledged the residual strength of such sentiment 
during the nineteenth century. In any case, the strength of the paradigm is its comparative 
thrust: the contrast it draws between the period in question and earlier and later political eras.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. correct a common misconception about a historical period
B. identify a feature of a historical period that has often been overlooked
C. challenge the validity of evidence used to support a claim
D. discuss certain challenges to a particular view
E. account for a particular feature of historical period
2. Select the sentence in the passage that describes how a historian might reply to attempts to
call his theory into question.
3. In the context in which it appears, “evoked” most nearly means
A. elicited
B. recalled
C. cited
D. suggested
E. elaborated

 Passage 56
Soil communities are dependent on plants for organic matter. Plants provide organic matter for 
soil communities through the decomposition of leaf litter, by oozing nutrients from roots, or 
through other methods of deposition of organic compounds into the soil environments. As a 
result of these diverse methods by which plants supply resources, unique soil communities 
form under different plant species and under plant communities that differ in composition. If a 
nonnative plant species invades an above-ground community of flora and fauna, it can alter 
links between the native above-ground community and the below-ground soil community. For 
example, an invading nonnative plant could alter the quantity of leaf litter production, which 
would alter nutrient contributions to the soil.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. According to the passage, plants supply resources to soil communities by which of the
following methods?
A. Some plants supply resources to soil communities by promoting diversity of above-ground
flora and fauna.
B. Some plants supply resources to soil communities by oozing nutrients from their roots.
C. Some plants supply resources to soil communities by depositing leaf litter.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. Which of the following statements about the connection between above-ground plants and
below-ground soil communities can be inferred from the passage?
A. Because of the nature of the link between above-and below-ground communities, many soil
communities are deficient in nutrients.
B. The extent to which soil communities are dependent on above-ground plants is extremely
variable from one soil community to another.
C. Because different plants supply resources to soil communities in different ways, distinctive
soil communities form under different plant communities.
72


 Passage 57
Recent studies of the Philippine fruit bat fauna have confirmed some previous hypotheses 
regarding bats on oceanic islands: for example, species richness[ the number of different 
species in a particular area] and abundance are generally highest in the lowlands and 
decrease with increasing elevation. With few exceptions, each endemic species [species 
native to a particular place] is restricted to the modern islands that made up a single island 
during periods of low sea level, and genetic differentiation has been influenced by the 
ecology of the species and the current and past geographic and geological conditions. 
However, far more previous hypotheses have been overturned than supported. Some endemic 
Philippine species use disturbed habitat as extensively as nonendemic species that are 
widespread in Southeast Asia. Levels of genetic variation within all species are high, not low, 
and rather than showing evidence of an intrinsic vulnerability to extinction from natural causes, 
independent lineages of these bats have persisted in rather small areas for very long periods 
of time(often millions of years) in spite of frequent typhoons and volcanic eruptions. While 
colonization from outside areas has clearly contributed to the high species richness, speciation 
within the archipelago has contributed at least a quarter of the total species richness, including 
many of the most abundant species.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. draw on studies of the Philippine fruit bat in proposing a new theory regarding bats  on
oceanic islands
B. show how recent research on the Philippine fruit bat reflects debates about bats on oceanic
islands
C. argue for the relevance of certain new evidence pertaining to the Philippine fruit bat or the
study of bats on oceanic islands
D. discuss recent investigations of Philippines fruit bat in light of conventional wisdom
regarding bats on oceanic islands
E. explain why the Philippine fruit bat is atypical among bats on oceanic islands in terms of
genetic variation
2. The primary function of the highlighted text is to
A. identify a finding from the Philippine fruit bat studies that will have a significant impact on
how oceanic bats generally are viewed
B. point out a hypothesis that has been the subject of considerable disagreement among
researchers studying oceanic bats
C. present evidence that is difficult to reconcile with other recent findings regarding the
Philippine fruit bat
D. illustrate a widely held view about oceanic bats generally that was confirmed by the
Philippine fruit bat studies
E. identify a feature of the Philippine fruit bat that does not appear to apply to oceanic bats
generally
3. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the “recent studies”?
A. They point to the need for a significantly revised perspective on oceanic island bats
generally.
B. They were undertaken with the assumption that Philippine fruit bats were somewhat
atypical among oceanic bats.
C. They remain some what controversial among researchers because of the number of
standard hypotheses that they tested.
D. They have largely confirmed what scientists thought about the Philippine fruit bat.
E. They suggest that bats on oceanic islands are more vulnerable to extinction than previously
thought.
73


 Passage 58
Recent studies of the gender gap in the history of United States policies tend to focus on 
candidate choice rather than on registration and turnout. This shift in focus from gender 
inequality in political participation may be due to the finding in several studies of voting 
behavior in the United States that since 1980, differences in rates of registration and voting 
between men and women are not statistically significant after controlling for traditional 
predictors of participation. However, Fullerton and Stern argue that researchers have 
overlooked the substantial gender gap in registration and voting in the South. While the 
gender gap in participation virtually disappeared outside the South by the 1950s, substantial 
gender differences persisted in the South throughout the 1950s and 1960s, only beginning to 
decline in 1970s.
1. Select the sentence in the passage that offers a possible explanation for a trend.
2. According to the passage, which of the following is true about recent studies of the gender
gap in the United States politics?
A. They accurately depict voter preference in the South prior to 1980.
B. They have been unduly influenced by changes in voter preferences.
C. They fail to recognize important factors affecting levels of voter participation.
D. They do not pay sufficient attention to the effect regional differences have on voter
preference.
E. They are more concerned with the choices that male and female voters make than with the
frequency with which they vote.
3. The author of the passage cites “several studies of voting behavior in the United States” to
A. suggest that rates of change in political participation have moderated
B. provide a possible explanation for a propensity among certain researchers
C. indicate an area of research that is particularly promising
D. speculate about the implications of a change
E. suggest that a particular area of study has not been very productive
4. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. establishing the chronology of a transition
B. discussing a perceived oversight
C. explaining the reasons for a change
D. evaluating an underlying assumption
E. conﬁrming the merits of a claim
74


 Passage 59
Recent studies of ancient Maya water management have found that the urban architecture of 
some cities was used to divert rainfall runoff into gravity-fed systems of interconnected 
reservoirs. In the central and southern May Lowlands, this kind of water control was necessary 
to support large populations throughout the year due to the scarcity of perennial surface water 
and the seasonal availability of rainfall. Some scholars argue that the concentration of water 
within the urban core of these sites provided a centralized source of political authority for 
Maya elites based largely on controlled water access. Such an argument is plausible, 
however, it is less useful for understanding the sociopolitical implications of water use and 
control in other, water-rich parts of the Maya region.
1. The author of the passage implies which of the following about the political importance of
the type of urban water management system described in the passage?
A. Because the system was centralized, it allowed political control over a widely scattered
population.
B. The knowledge required to design and maintain the system became the pretext for Maya
elites’ political authority.
C. By selectively limiting access to water, Maya elites used the system to curb challenges to
their authority
D. The system is not sufficient to explain the sources of centralized political power in all parts
of the Maya region
E. The system’s continued maintenance required political authorities to exert control over an
increasing proportion of economic resources.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. According to the passage, which of the following is true of the water management systems
in the central and southern Maya Lowlands?
A. They were implemented in part because of the prevailing pattern of rainfall.
B. They were an integral part of lowland cities’ architecture.
C. They were needed because of insufficient resources such as ponds, rivers and lakes in the
lowlands.
75


 Passage 60
Ralph Ellison was passionately interested in visual arts. He immersed himself in Harlem’s art 
scene in the 1930s, even apprenticing with sculptor Richmond Barthe for a time. Yet he was 
wary of projects aiming to provide a visual rendering of his novel Invisible Man. He reluctantly 
allowed Franklin Library to publish two illustrated versions of the novel but found the results 
disappointing and repeatedly rejected proposed film versions of the book. Despite his 
involvement in visual arts, Ellison insisted that only language could capture the complexity of 
American identity. This complexity consisted of the tension arising from the collision of the 
United States’ written ideals, as outlined in the founding documents, and the historical and 
contemporary experience molding the national consciousness.
1. It can be inferred that the author mentions Ellison’s apprenticeship with Richmond Barthe
primarily in order to
A. show that Ellison drew upon some aspects of the visual arts in developing his ideas for
Invisible Man
B. show that Ellison’s claim for the superiority of the language drive from his experience with
other are forms
C. establish that Ellison had experience with an art form that interested many leading figures
of the 1930s Harlem art scene
D. suggest that in the 1930s the Harlem art scene provided an environment in which artists
were likely to work in several media
E. qualify Ellison’s reservations about visual renderings of his work by showing that he was not
indifferent to visual art
2. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the “tension”?
A. It partly resulted from social injustices that Ellison worked to alleviate.
B. It came to Ellison’s attention partly as a result of his experience with proposed film versions
of Invisible Man.
C. Ellison thought that it could not be adequately represented by sculpture.
D. Ellison believed that it arose from contradictions within the United States’ founding ideals.
E. Ellison felt that it was an issue that could not adequately be addressed through the
depiction of fictional characters.
76


 Passage 61
Our terrestrial food supply comes from ecosystems transformed to produce a few comestible 
species through the removal of competitors, predators, and pests, but marine capture fisheries 
depend on the overall productivity of natural ecosystems. There is, however, increasing 
concern about the impact of fishing and other human activities on marine ecosystems, which 
are now far from pristine. One option for moving toward both biodiversity and terrestrial food 
supply goals is to produce greater yields from less land, thereby freeing land for conservation 
purposes. By contrast, the objective of maintaining or resorting the biodiversity of marine 
ecosystems may conflict with the objective of maintaining or increasing our food supply from 
the sea, since the level of fishing required to achieve the latter may compromise the former.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. examine the impact of certain research findings regarding changes to ecosystem
biodiversity.
B. discuss a possible implication of a difference between terrestrial and marine food supply
sources.
C. describe the consequences of a certain kind of interaction between terrestrial and marine
ecosystems.
D. identify an area of ecosystem research in which here are significant uncertainties
E. present evidence that undermines one side of a debate about biodiversity and supports the
other.
2. According to the passage, increasing the food yield per unit of land can have which of the
following effects?
A. enabling more land to be used for development purposes
B. compromising progress toward conservation goals
C. helping protect comestible species from competition and predation
D. helping reduce pressure on marine ecosystems
E. helping restore the biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems
77


 Passage 62
Much recent work has examined the claim that women encounter increasing obstacles relative 
to men as they move up the organizational ladder in business. This proposition, which we term 
the increasing-disadvantage model, is a core element of the popular glass ceiling metaphor. 
Despite continued widespread public acceptance of the glass ceiling idea and some consistent 
findings, most research to date has failed to support the increasing-disadvantage model. 
Indeed, several studies based on private-sector firms find that women’ s mobility prospects 
improve, rather than decline, as they climb upward in corporate hierarchies. In the public 
sector, researchers have found either no sex differences in mobility or a larger female 
disadvantage in lower grades.
Comparing cross-sectional national samples of workers, Baxter and Wright found no evidence 
in the United States, and only limited evidence in Sweden and Australia, that women’ s 
probability of being located in a higher versus a lower hierarchical level declined relative to 
men’ s at higher levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that the glass ceiling may be a 
myth. Women’ s scarcity in top organizational ranks may simply represent the cumulative 
effect of a constant-or even decreasing-disadvantage at successive hierarchical levels.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. compare two explanations for a recurring problem
B. summarize evidence relevant to a hypothesis
C. point out inconsistencies in a set of findings
D. account for the persistence of a point of view
E. reconsider the origins an ongoing issue
2. Based on the passage, which of the following is true of the “limited evidence” from Sweden
and Australia?
A. It lends supports to the increasing-disadvantage model.
B. It correlates with findings on women’ s mobility from most other counties.
C. It suggests important cultural similarities between these countries.
D. It points to a phenomenon not widely recognized in these countries.
E. It helps explain the persistence of the glass ceiling.
3. The author of the passage and those accepting the “proposition” would most likely agree
with which of the following?
A. Lower down on the organizational ladder, women tend to experience fewer disadvantages
than they do at higher levels.
B. Women experience no more disadvantages in moving up the organizational ladder than do
men.
C. The degree of disadvantage experiences by women remains constant as women move up
the organizational ladder.
D. The obstacles to women’ s advancement vary significantly from country to country.
E. Women face some disadvantage at each stage of the organizational ladder.
78


 Passage 63
In various writings from the 1940s on popular culture, George Orwell examined commercial 
texts such as comics and crime novels, seeking out political meanings that ran counter to what 
he considered an inherent tendency toward socialism in the English common people. The 
public, he concluded, was often being duped by a convert patrician conservatism, conveyed 
through commercial culture, that restrained the people’s radical instincts. These works 
constituted some of Orwell’ s greatest writing, yet those who see him as a lone precursor to 
today’s cultural studies, a field in which scholars examine the ideological implications of 
popular culture, are mistaken. A number of left-wing writers in the 1930s, many of them 
associated with the Communist Party, saw the need to take popular culture seriously.
The passage suggests which of the following about George Orwell? 
A. He regarded commercial texts a vehicles for the views of ordinary people.
B. He regarded many commercial texts as having an insidious effect on readers.
C. He considered commercial text such as comics to be unworthy of serious analysis.
D. He initiated a new direction in scholarship by taking popular culture seriously.
E. He regarded commercial texts as inappropriate vehicles for political ideas.
79


 Passage 64
In the life of Charlotte Bronte(1857), the first and the most celebrated biography of novelist 
Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell promoted the long-persisting romantic view of Bronte as 
having no connection with the rest of English society at a time when industrialization was 
causing much turbulence, but as having sprung naturally, like so much purple heather, out of 
the English countryside. Gaskell also portrayed Bronte as irreproachably proper, incapable of 
“unladylike” feelings or dangerous views; this was at variance with the subversive spirit 
Matthew Arnold accurately discerned, albeit with distance, deep within Bronte’ s fiction. While 
correcting many of Gaskell’ s errors and omissions at last, even Winifred Gerin’ s Charlotte 
Bronte: The Evolution of Genius(1967) failed to discard Gaskell’ s viewpoint. Feminist have 
introduced new interpretations of Bronte’ s life, but it is primarily Juliet Barker who takes into 
account the larger world that impinged on that life-- the changing England in which old 
divisions of class and gender were under pressure.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. consider similarities in several studies of Charlotte Bronte’ s life
B. defend a particular view of Charlotte Bronte’ life
C. discuss a change in perspective on Charlotte Bronte’ s life
D. depict the social environment in which Charlotte Bronte lived
E. portray Charlotte Bronte as an early feminist writer
2. The passage suggest that Matthew Arnold disapproved of Charlotte Bronte’ s fiction insofar
as he believed that it
A. overly romanticized the English countryside
B. contained dangerous ideas buried within it
C. perpetuated outmoded social distinctions
D. failed to represent industrialized society realistically
E. reflected an excessive concern with propriety
3. The passage suggest that Gaskell’ s biography of Charlotte Bronte advanced the idea that
Bronte was
A. one of the most celebrated of the romantic novelist
B. an outspoken advocate of the social change
C. opposed to the industrialization of England
D. strongly influenced by the social upheaval of the times
E. chiefly the product of a rustic environment
80


 Passage 65
In the country of Seligia where asbestos has been used extensively in construction, that use is 
about to be banned, because the exposure of construction workers to asbestos can cause a 
certain type of cancer. We can predict that the ban will result in reducing the incidence of 
that type of cancer in Seligia by as much as 50 percent. 
It is true that less than 30 percent of the death certificates of Seligians who have died of 
that cancer have “construction” listed as the deceased’s occupation. The cancer takes 
about 20 years after exposure to develop, however, and Seligians who have worked in 
construction commonly turn to less strenuous occupations as they age. Seligian death 
certificates indicate only the deceased’s last occupation.
In the argument given, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles? 
A. The first is a prediction that argument seeks to defend, the second presents evidence that if
not supplemented would cast doubt on that judgment.
B. The first is a prediction that the argument seeks to defend, the second is a finding, the
accuracy of which is disputed by the argument as a whole.
C. The first is a prediction that the argument as a whole rejects the second presents evidence
on which that rejection is based
D. The first is a prediction that the argument as a whole seeks to defend, the second is
evidence that the defense can be at best partially successful.
E. The first is a prediction that is cited in order to justify a stated conclusion, the second is a
consideration that has been raised against that conclusion.
Passage 66
In recent decades, scholars of American literature have skillfully revealed authors’ 
simultaneous accommodation and resistance to an increasingly commercialized, capitalized 
environment during the early nineteenth century. Historians of the period have not, however, 
fully exploited literary criticism, due to the disciplinary boundaries that mark contemporary 
academic research. Few historians have extensive training in critical theory and its specialized 
languages, and the sheer volume of work in early American history and literature challenges 
anyone who would master either field, much less both. Moreover, historians study people 
across the nation, but much literary scholarship called “American” actually examines works 
produced in northeastern states. And historians usually study the operations of capitalism in its 
details, while literary critics produce a generalized picture of literary commodification.
1. As discussed in the passage, the literary scholars and the historians differ in which of the
following ways?
A. the amount of scholarship that they produce
B. the nature of their geographic focus
C. the extent to which they are critical of early capitalism
D. the extent to which they are interested in interdisciplinary study
E. The extent to which they restrict their focus to a particular time period
2. The passage cites which of the following as a reason for historians’ failure to fully exploit
literary criticism?
A. historians’ overly thematic approach to literature
B. historians’ conservative notion of what constitutes literature
C. historian’s lack of interest in critical theory
D. the distinctive nature of much literary criticism
E. the ahistorical quality of much literary criticism
81


3. The passage cites which of the following as reasons for historians’ failure to fully exploit literary 
criticism?
A. The amount of scholarship involved
B. The distinctive nature of literary criticism
C. The ahistorical quality of much literary criticism
82


 Passage 67
In 1755 British writer Samuel Johnson published an acerbic letter to Lord Chesterfield 
rebuking his patron for neglect and declining further support. Johnson’s rejection of his 
patron’s belated assistance has often been identified as a key moment in the history of 
publishing, marking the end of the culture of patronage. However, patronage had been in 
decline for 50 years, yet would survive, in attenuated form, for another 50. Indeed, 
Johnson was in 1762 awarded a pension by the Crown—a subtle form of sponsorship, 
tantamount to state patronage. The importance of Johnson’s letter is not so much historical as 
emotional; it would become a touchstone for all who repudiated patrons and for all who 
embraced the laws of the marketplace.
1. The author of the passage mentions Johnson’s 1762 pension award in order to
A. reveal that Johnson remained consistent in his rebuke of Lord Chesterfield well after 1755
B. provide evidence for a general trend in the latter half of the eighteenth century of private
patronage’s being replaced by state sponsorship
C. situate the debate over the end of patronage within the wider realm of eighteenth-century
economic history
D. suggest that Johnson’s letter to Chesterfield was noticed by the Crown only years after it
was published
E. emphasize that patronage still helped support Johnson’s writing after his letter to
Chesterfield
2. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted phrase in the context of
the passage as a whole? (patronage had been in decline for 50 years, yet would survive, in
attenuated form, for another 50)
A. It points out the most obvious implications of Johnson’s letter to his patron.
B. It suggests a motivation for Johnson’s rejection of Chesterfield’ s patronage.
C. It provides information that qualifies the assertion that Johnson’s letter sharply defined of
the end of a publishing era.
D. It provides a possible defense for Chesterfield’s alleged neglect of Johnson.
E. It refutes the notion the patrons are found primarily among the nobility.
3. The author of the passage mentions Johnson’s 1762 pension award in order to
A. provide a speciﬁc example of patronage’s surviving into the second half of the eighteenth
century
B. emphasize that patronage still helped support Johnson’s writing after his letter to Chesterﬁeld
C. provide evidence for a general trend in the later half of the eighteenth century of private
patronage’s being replaced by state sponsorship
4. Which of the following statements about literary patronage may be inferred from the passage?
A. It was strongly defended by most patrons.
B. It was regulated by the state in Britain after 1762.
C. It had largely fallen out of favor by 1800.
83


 Passage 68
Historically, more cold-adapted antelope species originating in Eurasia have migrated into 
Africa, where the climate is generally warmer, than have warm-adapted African species into 
Eurasia. A likely explanation for this involves the fact that intercontinental migrations require 
both a land bridge connecting the two continents and the suitable habitat both on and across 
that land bridge. During periods of climatic cooling, such as the various ice ages, the land 
bridge is open for a long time (because sea level remains low) and is usable by cold-adapt 
species because cool habitats then extend across it. Thus during cooling most migrants would 
be expected to travel toward Africa, which is near the equator, since this is the direction 
dictated by habitat changes on a cooling Earth. In contrast, when the Earth is warm, the land 
bridge is reduced or gone because sea level is relatively high then. Only during the short lag 
between onset of global temperature change and sea level response can warm-adapted 
species migrate from the equator toward higher latitudes.
1. According to the passage, which of the following is true of an Eurasia-Africa land bridge
during ice ages?
A. It offers suitable habitats for cold-adapted species of antelope.
B. It encourages migration from Africa to Eurasia of cold-adapted species of antelope.
C. It allows the survival of warm-adapted species of antelope that might otherwise home
extinct.
D. It is more likely to exist early in an ice age than later in an ice age.
E. The habitats it offers change more quickly than do those offered by land bridges during
other periods.
2. The author of the passage implies that during the “short lag”, a land bridge between Africa
and Eurasia would
A. be inhabited primarily by species of antelope originating in Eurasia
B. be characterized by areas of widely varying elevation above sea level
C. be inhabited by a wide diversity of antelope species
D. contain habitats that could sustain warm-adapt antelope species
E. contain habitats similar to habitats at much higher latitudes in Eurasia
3. According to the passage, which of the following best accounts for the apparent bias in
antelope-migration direction?
A. Warm-adapted antelope species are rarely able to tolerate cool habitats, whereas cold-
adapted antelope species usually can tolerate warm habitats.
B. During global warming periods, land bridges, when present, lack habitats suitable for
sustaining warm-adapted antelope species.
C. Under most climatic conditions, Africa offers a larger number of suitable antelope habitats
than does Eurasia.
D. Many more species of antelope have originated in Eurasia than have originated in Africa.
E. Land bridges are more likely to exist when climate change favors migration to warmer
climates than when climate changes favors migration to cooler climates.
84


 Passage 69
Historian Colin Calloway argues that in the late colonial period preceding the American 
Revolution (1775-1783), the British government sought to seal off territory west of the 
Appalachian Mountain from the encroachment of land-hungry White settlers, to negotiate with 
Native American peoples as independent foreign states, and to guarantee the integrity of 
traditional native American hunting grounds. By contrast, White Americans, released by the out 
break of the Revolution from the constraints of Britain’s allegedly benevolent policies, are 
portrayed by Calloway as ruthless land-grabbers whose new national government endorsed 
their rapacity. Bernard Bailyn argues, however, that the “Americans” who encroached on 
Native American land during the Revolution had been British only a few years before. When, 
during and after the Revolution, White Americans seized Native American land by any 
available means, they were continuing a tradition dating back to the earliest years of English 
settlement in North America. And, according to Bailyn, the British government’s prewar efforts 
to preserve the trans-Appalachian west for Native Americans resulted not from humanitarian 
virtue or ethnic tolerance but from British Merchants’ desire to maintain their lucrative trade 
with native Americans and the government’ s desire to control immigration and avoid costly 
conflict between White and Native Americans over land.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. suggest that two different arguments about a particular historical period are both
questionable
B. present historical evidence that undermines a widely accepted viewpoints
C. defend a revisionist historian’s thesis against traditionalist criticism
D. outline opposing interpretations of a particular historical phenomenon
E. resolve a dispute among historians over a controversial historical episode
2. The reference to “the earliest years of English settlement in North America” serves primarily
to emphasize the point that
A. Calloway has exaggerated the ruthlessness and rapacity of White settlers in their relations
with native Americans prior to the American Revolution.
B. Seizure of Native American lands by White settlers had increased dramatically throughout
the time of British Colonial rule.
C. At one time White settlers had negotiated with Native American people as independent
foreign states.
D. White settlers had no legitimate ground for claiming title to land they seized west of the
Appalachian Mountains.
E. Aggression by White settlers against Native Americans during and after the American
Revolution was not a new phenomenon.
3. It can be inferred that both Bailyn and Calloway would probably agree with which of the
following assertions regarding the relations between White Americans and Native Americans
concerning the trans-Appalachian west
A. The American Revolution unleashed an unprecedented wave of expropriation of Native
American land by White settlers.
B. The British government’s prewar policy towards the Native Americans was determined
largely by the interests of British merchants who traded with the Native Americans.
C. The British government tried to keep White settlers out of the trans-Appalachian west
primarily in order to prevent disputes over land between those settlers and Native Americans.
D. The new national colonial government to negotiate with Native American peoples as
independent foreign states.
E. One objective of the British government’s land policy prior to the American revolution was to
prevent White settlers from moving to the western side of the Appalachian Mountains.
85


 Passage 70
The main exception to primate researchers’ general pattern has been the study of male care 
among monogamous primates. It has been known for over 200 years, ever since a zoologist-
illustrator named George Edwards decided to watch the behavior of pet marmosets in a 
London garden, that among certain species of New World monkeys males contributed direct 
care for infants that equaled or exceeded that given by females. Mothers among marmosets 
and tamarins typically give birth to twins, as often as twice a year, and to court the female in 
her staggering reproductive burden the male carries the infant at all times except when the 
mother is actually suckling it. It was assumed by Kleiman that monogamy and male confidence 
of paternity were essential to the evolution of such care, and at the same time, it was assumed 
by Symons and others that monogamy among primates must be fairly rare.
Recent findings, however, make it necessary to reverse this picture. First of all, monogamy 
among primates turns out to be rather more frequent than previously believed (either obligate 
or facultive monogamy can be documented for some 17-20 percent of extant primates) and 
second, male care turns out to be far more extensive than previously thought and not 
necessarily confined to monogamous species, according to Hrdy. Whereas previously, it was 
assumed that monogamy and male certainty of paternity facilitated the evolution of male care, 
it now seems appropriate to consider the alternative possibility that the extraordinary capacity 
of male primates to look out for the fates of infants did in some way pre-adapt members of this 
order for the sort of close, long-term relationships between males and females that, under 
some ecological circumstances, leads to monogamy. Either scenario could be true. The point 
is that on the basis of present knowledge there is no reason to view male care as a restricted 
or specialized phenomenon. In sum, though it remains true that mothers among virtually all 
primates devote more time and/ or energy to rearing infants than do males, males nonetheless 
play a more varied and critical role in infant survival than is generally realized.
1. The author the passage mentions the work of Hrdy primarily to
A. present an instance of untenable assumption
B. illustrate a consensus by citing a representative claim
C. provide evidence that challenges a belief
D. highlight a corollary og a widespread view
E. offer data that help resolve a debate
2. According to the passage, the evolutionary relationship between male care and monogamy
is
A. incontestable
B. immutable
C. uncommon
D. immaterial
E. uncertain
3. The author of the passage suggests that it is “appropriate to consider the alternative
possibility” because the previous view
A. results in a contradiction
B. depends on problematic data
C. appears less definite given certain facts
D. conflates two distinct phenomena
E. overlooks a causal relationship between correlated phenomena
86


4. Which of the following statement, if true, would provide the greatest support to “the
alternative possibility”?
A. The number of primate species in which male care of infants is exhibited is greater than the
number of primate species that practice monogamy.
B. Male care of infants among primates can be seen earlier in the evolutionary record than can
monogamy among primates.
C. Monogamous relationships among primates can be found in species living in a variety of
physical environments.
D. Most primate species that practice monogamy do not show any evidence of male care of
infants.
E. Male care of infants can be observed in some primate species that lack male confidence of
paternity.

 Passage 71
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1868, prohibits state 
governments from denying citizens the “equal protection of the laws.” Although precisely what 
the framers of the amendment meant by this equal protection clause remains unclear, all 
interpreters agree that the framers’ immediate objective was to provide a constitutional warrant 
for the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which guaranteed the citizenship of all persons born in the 
United States and subject to United States jurisdiction. This declaration, which was echoed in 
the text of the Fourteenth Amendment, was designed primarily to counter the Supreme Court’s 
ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford that Black people in the United States could be denied 
citizenship. The act was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, who argued that the Thirteenth 
Amendment, which abolished slavery, did not provide Congress with the authority to extend 
citizenship and equal protection to the freed slaves. Although Congress promptly overrode 
Johnson’s veto, supporters of the act sought to ensure its constitutional foundations with the 
passage of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The broad language of the amendment strongly suggests that its framers were proposing to 
write into the Constitution not a laundry list of specific civil rights but a principle of equal 
citizenship that forbids organized society from treating any individual as a member of an 
inferior class. Yet for the first eight decades of the amendment’s existence, the Supreme 
Court’s interpretation of the amendment betrayed this ideal of equality. In the Civil Rights 
Cases of 1883, for example, the Court invented the “state action” limitation, which asserts that 
“private” decisions by owners of public accommodations and other commercial business to 
segregate their facilities are insulated from the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment’s 
guarantee of equal protection under the law.
After the Second World War, a judicial climate more hospitable to equal protection claims 
culminated in the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that racially 
segregated schools violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Two 
doctrines embraced by the Supreme Court during this period extended the amendment’s 
reach. First, the Court required especially strict scrutiny of legislation that employed a “suspect 
classification,” meaning discrimination against a group on grounds that could be construed as 
racial. This doctrine has broadened the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to other, 
nonracial forms of discrimination, for while some justices have refused to find any legislative 
classification other than race to be constitutionally disfavored, most have been receptive to 
arguments that at least some nonracial discriminations, sexual discrimination in particular, are 
“suspect” and deserve this heightened scrutiny by the courts. Second, the Court relaxed the 
state action limitation on the Fourteenth Amendment, bringing new forms of private 
conduct within the amendment’ s reach.
88


1. Which of the following best describes the main idea of the passage?
A. By presenting a list of specific rights, framers of the Fourteenth Amendment were
attempting to provide a constitutional basis for broad judicial protection of the principle of
equal citizenship
B. Only after the Supreme Court adopted the suspect classification approach to reviewing
potentially discrimination legislation was the applicability of the Fourteenth Amendment
extended to include sexual discrimination
C. Not until after the Second World War did the Supreme Court begin to interpret the
Fourteenth Amendment in a manner consistent with the principle of equal citizenship that it
express.
D. Interpreters of the Fourteenth Amendment have yet to reach consensus with regard to what
its framers meant by the equal protection clause
E. Although the reluctance of judges to extend the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment to
nonracial discrimination has betrayed the principle of equal citizenship, the Supreme Court’s
use of the state action limitation to insulate private activity from the amendment’s reach has
been more harmful.
2. The passage suggests that the principle effect of the state action limitation was to
A. allow some discriminatory practices to continue unimpeded by the Fourteenth Amendment
B. influence the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education
C. provide expanded guidelines describing prohibited actions
D. prohibit states from enacting laws that violated the intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1866
E. shift to state government the responsibility for enforcement of laws prohibiting
discriminatory practices
3. The author’s position regarding the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment
would be most seriously undermined if which of the following were true?
A. The framers had anticipated state action limitations as they are described in the passage.
B. The framers had merely sought to prevent discriminatory acts by federal officials.
C. The framers were concerned that the civil rights act of 1866 would be overturned by the
Supreme Court.
D. The framers were aware that the phrase “equal protection of the laws”had broad
implications.
E. The framers believed that racial as well as non-racial forms of discrimination were
unacceptable.
4. According to the passage, the original proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment were
primarily concerned with
A. detailing the rights afforded by the principle of equal citizenship
B. providing support in the Constitution for equal protection for all citizens of the United States
C. closing a loophole that could be used to deny individuals the right to sue for enforcement of
their civil rights
D. asserting that the civil rights protect by the Constitution included nonracial discrimination as
well as racial discrimination
E. granting state government broader discretion in interpreting the Civil Rights Act in 1866
5. The author implies that the Fourteenth Amendment might not have been enacted if
A. congress’ authority with regard to legislating civil rights had not been challenged
B. the framers has anticipated the Supreme Courts ruling in Brown v. Board of Education
C. the framers had believed that it would be used in deciding cases of discrimination involving
non-racial groups
D. most state governments had been willing to protect citizens’ civil rights
E. its essential elements had not been implicit in the Thirteenth Amendment
89


6. According to the passage, which of the following most accurately indicates the sequence of 
the events listed below?
Ⅰ. civil rights act of 1866
Ⅱ. Dred Scott v. Sandford
Ⅲ. Fourteenth Amendment
Ⅳ. Veto by President Johnson
A. Ⅰ Ⅱ Ⅲ Ⅳ
B. Ⅰ Ⅳ Ⅱ Ⅲ
C. Ⅰ Ⅳ Ⅲ Ⅱ
D. Ⅱ Ⅰ Ⅳ Ⅲ
E. Ⅲ Ⅱ Ⅰ Ⅳ
7. Which of the following can be inferred about the second of the two doctrines (highlighted
sentence) of the passage?
A. It caused some justice to rule that all types of discrimination are prohibited by the
Constitution.
B. It shifted the focus of the Supreme Court from racial to nonracial discrimination.
C. It narrowed the concern of the Supreme Court to legislation that employed a suspect
classification.
D. It caused legislators who were writing new legislation to reject language that could be
construed as permitting racial discrimination.
E. It made it more difficult for commercial business to practice racial discrimination.

 Passage 72
Roughly 250 million years ago, in the worst series of mass extinction in Earth’s history, almost 
all species of life simply vanished. The traditionally held view has been that these extinctions 
occurred gradually, as changing environmental conditions—global cooling, global warming, 
dropping sea levels, or some combination of such factors—made life increasingly difficult 
during the last stages of the Permian period (284-245 million years ago). As Permian life-forms 
declined, they reached a fatal threshold and species succumbed to mass extinction. 
Supporters of the traditionalist view note that species begin disappearing from the fossil record 
well before the end of the Permian period. Yet, while such a pattern could have resulted from a 
slowly rising extinction rate, some scientists argue that just because a species disappears 
from the fossil record doesn’t necessarily mean it became extinct at that point. Moreover, Paul 
Wignall and others have found sites where marine fossil deposits reached a peak of diversity 
at the very end of the Permian period. Thus, Wignall believes late-Permian marine life was 
thriving until it was decimated suddenly by some catastrophe.
Some geoscientists think that this catastrophe involved a meteor striking the earth. Michael 
Rampino, for instance, claims that a giant meteor crashed into Gondwanaland (the southern 
portion of the supercontinent Pangea, which covered about 30 percent of the globe in Permian 
times), setting off intense volcanism. Airborne soot and dirt from the impact blanketed Earth, 
inhibiting photosynthesis and triggering mass extinction of species. This view is widely 
disputed by traditionalists, however, Grant Young, for example, holds that the gradual breakup 
of the Pangean supercontinent triggered widespread climatic change and glaciation,causing 
the Permian mass extinctions to occur over million of years. Glaciation, Young claims, has 
occurred throughout Earth’s history, and there is evidence that it occurred toward the end off 
the Permian period. Yet Rampino and others question one of the traditionalists’ basic 
assumption: the periodic occurrence of glaciation throughout Earth’s history. Crucial evidence 
includes the rock deposits know as tillites, because they resemble the unstratified drift 
produced by modern glaciers, geologists have long considered tillites to be signposts of 
glaciation. When trying to determine whether particular sedimentary layers represent tillite 
deposits, geologists look for stones with faceted shapes, scratched surfaces, and other 
features that presumably resulted from glacial action. The problem with ascribing all tillites to 
glaciation, however, is that tillite deposits are widespread in Precambrian sediments. Yet 
temperatures during the Precambrian (3.8 billion to 540 million years ago)are thought to have 
been warmer than those in today’s nonglacial world. Thus, Rampino thinks that certain tillites 
were produced by meteor impacts, not glaciers. The first compelling evidence that meteor 
impacts might have produced tillites came from Moon rocks that showed the same features as 
earthly tillites. Since no one believes the Moon ever had glaciers, that leaves but one possible 
cause: impacts.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. consider new applications for a traditional methodology
B. present a challenge to an established idea
C. question the purported severity of a particular phenomenon
D. discuss the implications of a controversial position
E. identify similarities underlying two contrasting arguments
2. According to the passage, the claim that all terrestrial tillites resulted from glacial action is
undermined by the
A. surface features of most terrestrial tillites
B. resemblance that exists between terrestrial tillites and unstratified drift
C. number of terrestrial tillites that date from the Precambrian period
D. facts that most terrestrial tillites are found in sedimentary deposits
E. evidence that they resemble the drift produced by modern glaciers
91


3. It can be inferred from the passage that author would agree that the similarity between
terrestrial tillites and certain Moon rocks is significant because this similarity
A. suggest that it is unlikely that glaciers have produced tillites on Earth
B. suggest that the rate of meteor impacts on the Moon is much higher than previously thought
C. provides the first compelling evidence that the Moon has experienced meteor impacts
D. supports Rampino’s explanation regarding the origin of certain terrestrial tillits
E. supports Young’s claim, regarding the periodic occurrence of glaciers throughout Earth’s
history
4. The passage suggests that the supporters of the traditional view would be most likely to
disagree with the “scientists”（highlighted） over which of the following regarding the fossil
record during the Permian period?
A. the number of species that disappeared from the fossil record during the Permian period
B. the significance of a species disappearance from the fossil record during the Permian
period
C. the point in time at which species began disappearing from the fossil record during the
Permian period
D. the likelihood that the fossil record during the Permian period will be supplemented by new
fossil discoveries
E. the likelihood that the fossil record during the Permian period is as accurate as the fossil
records of other periods
92


 Passage 73
Jane Austen’ s relationship to Romanticism has long been a vexed one. Although her dates 
(1775-1817) place her squarely within the period, she traditionally has been studied apart from 
the male poets whose work defined British Romanticism for most of the twentieth century. In 
the past her novels were thought to follow an Augustan mode at odds with the Romantic ethos. 
Even with the advent of historicist and feminist criticism, which challenged many previous 
characterizations of Austen as detached from the major social, political and aesthetic currents 
of her time, she continued to be distinguished from her male contemporaries. Jerome McCann, 
for example, insists that Austen does not espouse the Romantic ideology. Anne Mellor 
declares that Austen, along with other “leading women intellectual and writers of the day” “did 
not”, participate in the Romantic “spirit of the age” but instead embraced an alternative 
ideology that Mellor labels “feminine Romanticism”.
To be sure, some critics throughout the years have argued for Austen’s affinities with one or 
more of the male Romantic poets. A special issue of the Wordsworth Circle (Autumn 1976)was 
devoted to exploring connections between Austen and her male contemporaries. Clifford 
Siskin in his historicist study of Romanticism argued that Austen does participate in the same 
major innovation, the naturalization of belief in a developing self, as that characterized in 
Wordsworth’s poetry and other key works from the period. Recently, three books have 
appeared (by Clara Tuite, William Galperin, and William Deresiewicz) that in various ways 
treat Austen as a Romantic writer and together signal a shift in the tendency to segregate the 
major novelist of the age from the major poets.
The present essay seeks to contribute to this goal of firmly integrating Austen within the 
Romantic movement and canon. It does so by pointing out affinities between Austen and a 
writer with whom she has not commonly been associated, John Keats. Most comparisons of 
Austen and the Romantic poets have focused on Wordsworth and Byron, whose works we 
know she read. Although Austen could not have read Keats’ s poems, which only began to 
appear in print during the last years of her life, and there is no evidence that Keats knew 
Austen’ s novels, a number of important similarities can be noted in these writers’ works that 
provide further evidence to link Austen with the Romantic movement, especially the period of 
second-generation Romanticism when all of her novels were published.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. reconcile two competing positions in an ongoing critical debate
B. develop a counterargument against a recent interpretation of a writer’s work
C. provide support for a new approach to a writer’s work
D. illustrate the contradictions experienced by women writers during a certain period
E. explain a writer’s detachment from the major intellectual currents of a period
2. The author of the passage describes Austen’s relationship to Romanticism as “vexed”
mainly because
A. her novels do not follow the Augustan mode to the extent the poetry of her contemporaries
did
B. her views seem to be at odds with those of male writer whose works defined British
Romanticism
C. her novels were written during the Romantic period, yet she is not treated as a Romantic
writer
D. her novels are critical of the Romantic ideology, embracing instead an alternative ideology
sometimes described as “feminine Romanticism”
E. she achieved recognition for her novels, whereas the Romantic era is better know for its
poetry
93


3. According to to the passage, compared to critics trained in “historicist and feminist criticism” 
（highlighted）earlier critics of Austen were
A. more likely to represent her as isolated from the major intellectual currents of her period
B. more likely to represent her as departing from Augustan modes of thought
C. more likely to find connections between her novels and Romantic poetry
D. less likely to neglect the influence of Romantic ideology on her work
E. less likely to notice affinities between Austen and her female counterparts
4. The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of the following
statements about the concept of “feminine Romanticism”（highlighted）?
A. It bought about Austen’ s vexed relationship to Romanticism by implying that Austen
embraced relatively few elements of the Romantic ideology.
B. It contributes to Austen’ s vexed relationship to Romanticism by keeping her separate from
the male writers whose poetry is central to the period.
C. It ameliorates Austen’ s vexed relationship to Romanticism by emphasizing affinities
between he and other leading women intellectuals of the day.
D. It ameliorates Austen’ s vexed relationship to Romanticism by capturing the notion of an
alternative Romantic ideology that she espoused.
E. It resolves Austen’ s vexed relationship to Romanticism by demonstrating her affinity with
Romantic ideology.
Passage 74
The damage that trucks do to highways escalates dramatically with the weight borne per axle. 
New regulations increase the maximum permitted vehicle weight; these regulations will 
therefore allow onto the highway trucks capable of doing even more damage than those 
currently permitted.
1. The argument is open up to criticism on the grounds that it
A. fails to establish that the level of damage done by trucks is a serious problem
B. omits evidence about one of the two relevant factors
C. ignores the possibility that careful driving can lessen damage to highways
D. presumes that trucks are the only vehicles capable of causing substantial damage to
highways
E. presumes that something is bound to happen just because it is allowed to happen
94


 Passage 75
Normally, seeds of Emmenathe penduliflora stay dormant for years and germinate only when a 
fire burns through their habitat. Nitrogen dioxide in the smoke induces the seeds to germinate. 
Fires clear the brush, allowing germinating seeds to receive the sunlight they need to grow. 
The plants mature quickly, produce seeds, and then die. In areas with heavy automobile traffic, 
however, the seed germinates in the absence of fire, with automobile exhaust supplying the 
required nitrogen dioxide.
1. The information given, if accurate, most strongly supports which of the following
hypotheses?
A. Fires in the habitat of E. Penduliflora do not entirely destroy the plant’s seeds even in the
places where the fires burn most intensely.
B. The nitrogen dioxide in automobile exhaust cannot harm plants of E. Penduliflora after
germination.
C. If human intervention decreases the number of fires in the habitat of E. Penduliflora,
automobile exhaust can replicate the conditions the plant requires in order to thrive.
D. Within the habitat of E. Penduliflora, natural fires are significantly more frequent in areas
with heavy automobile traffic than they are in other areas.
E. Unless E. Penduliflora seeds that have germinated can survive in the shade, automobile
exhaust threatens the long-term survival of the plant in areas with heavy automobile traffic.
Passage 76
In most coastal regions, the level of the sea is rising in relation to the land by one to two 
millimeters a year, and this trend would be explained by the hypothesis that at the North and 
South Poles, the amount of ice that melts during the summer now exceeds the amount forms 
during the winter. The hypothesis is not undermined by observations that sea levels are 
falling relative to the Scandinavian coast by four millimeters a year. Much land in northern 
latitudes, including Scandinavia, is still rising in response to being freed of the enormous 
weight of the ice that used to cover it during the last ice age, and in Scandinavia the land is 
now rising faster than the sea.
In the passage, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles?
A. The first states observation the accuracy of which is challenged in the passage; the second
is part of the ground on which that challenge is based.
B. The first states observations that, according to the passage, are incompatible with a certain
hypothesis; the second is part of the grounds offered in support of a revision of that
hypothesis.
C. The first states observations that, according to the passage , can be reconciled with a
certain hypothesis; the second describes a phenomenon that is factual basis of that
reconciliation.
D. The first presents a phenomenon, two competing explanations of which are considered in
the passage; the second is the explanation of the phenomenon that the passage argues is
correct.
E. The first provides evidence against a position; the second is that position.
95


 Passage 77
Editors of major United States news magazines have been criticized for reducing the amount 
of space these magazines devote to international news. According to these editors, however, 
readers are wholly to blame for the reductions. After all, the editors point out, sales of 
magazine issues that prominently feature international news stories have declined 
significantly, and declining sales reflect declining reader interest. Yet even if true, this 
evidence does not refute the contention that editors should bear some of the blame for the 
reductions, unless editors are merely passive instruments responding to reader interest. And 
that is clearly an untenable view, since editors can often intensify reader interest in a news 
topic by giving it frequent coverage.
In the argument as a whole, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles?
A. The first is evidence that has been used to support a position that the argument opposes;
the second is a point that the argument raises to cast doubt on the reasoning used to support
that position.
B. The first presents a claim, the truth of which is evaluated in the argument, the second is
information introduced to cast doubt on that claim.
C. The first presents a claim,the truth of which is evaluated in the argument, the second
provides evidence in support of that claim.
D. The first cites evidence in support of the main conclusion of the argument, the second
states that conclusion.
E. The first states an assumption that is explicitly made to support the main conclusion of the
argument, the second is a position that the argument as whole opposes.
Passage 78
Benovians set their clocks back an hour for the winter. The result is that, during winter’s short 
days, it is light when most commuters drive to work, but dark when they drive back home. 
Darkness contributes to accidents. Changing the clocks, however, does not actually increase 
the amount of driving done in the dark, so it is unlikely to have any effect on Benovia’s 
automobile accident rate.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?
A. The average number of hours that Benovians drive when it is dark is greater for days during
the winter than for days during other times of the year.
B. In Benovia, hazards to safe driving that are made worse by darkness are as likely to occur
in the morning as in the evening.
C. The majority of cars on Benovia’s roads during a given day are those of people commuting
to or from work.
D. The majority of automobile accidents in Benovia take place when it is dark.
E. Driving conditions are no worse in Benovia in the winter than during the rest of the year.
96


 Passage 79
Elizabeth Bishop’s Complete Poems(1927-1979) has come to seem to most of its readers so 
achieved and sufficient as a life’s work that it is hard not to lose sight of how slowly Bishop 
wrote poems and of how few poems, finally, she completed. But Bishop herself never ceased 
to find her productivity inadequate. The size and pace of her output were always in her eyes a 
failing (vaguely moral in complexion) for which she apologized throughout her career, 
although, as I will argue in this essay, Bishop’s inability to write more poems than she did was 
also a refusal to do so. The small, manageable size of Bishop’s body of work has facilitated its 
extraordinary critical reception since her death. (Robert Lowell, whose oeuvre is so much 
larger, has never had a complete edition of his poetry published.) Yet the size of her work is 
also a sign of Bishop’s alienation, that is, her uneasy, resistant relation to the literary culture 
that today claims her as the major poet of her generation.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. The passage indicates that the small size of Bishop’s body of work contributed to bringing
about which of the following?
A. bishop’s alienation from the literary culture of her generation
B. the favorable scholarly attention that Bishop’s work has received since her death
C. an interest among readers regarding why Bishop wrote so slowly
2. In the context in which it appears, “complexion” most nearly means
A. appearance
B. constitution
C. hue
D. intricacy
E. personality
Passage 80
Shoreland County recently purchased an area of wilderness land in the county to prevent it 
from being developed. In doing so, the county has forfeited all future property taxes on this 
land. Property taxes are assessed on market value, and if developed, the land would have 
contributed significantly to the county’s overall annual tax revenue. Because of the purchase, 
therefore, overall annual tax revenue will be lower than it would have been if development had 
occurred.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A. The money the county would have had to expend for services to residences or industry
developed on the wilderness land would have exceeded the tax revenue from the developed
land.
B. The market value of undeveloped properties in Shoreland County will not increase
significantly in the foreseeable future.
C. The property taxes received by Shoreland County from the previous owners of the
wilderness area were insignificant relative to the county’s overall annual tax revenue.
D. Land near the area bought by the county will not increase significantly in market value as a
result of being near wilderness that is protected from development.
E. Shoreland County will not in the foreseeable future prevent the development of any other
land in the county.
97


 Passage 81
Following the United States Civil War (1861-1865), many former slaves in the rural South 
became sharecroppers (raising a landlord’ s crop for a share of the profits) or tenant farmers 
(selling what they raised and paying a share of the profits as rent). Most historians tend to 
depict these African Americans as victims of racism and the farm tenancy system. This 
approach, however, overlooks the role played by such African American rural reformers as 
Robert Lloyd Smith, founder of the Farmers' Improvement Society of Texas, and Joseph 
Elward Clayton, the first African American to organize farmers' institutes for the Texas 
Department of Agriculture. Both men advocated comfortable homes and better schools for 
African Americans; both attributed poverty and illiteracy to causes other than racism, such as 
insect damage to crops; and both worked to keep Black farmers on the land, although Smith 
opposed farm tenancy. Both were also accused by their contemporaries of downplaying the 
devastating impact of the farm tenancy system on Black farmers and of accommodating 
racism. While the extent of these reformers' influence requires more study, clearly their 
organizations provided a voice for African American farmers seeking to improve their positions 
in the agrarian South.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. restoring the reputations of two reformers whose accomplishments have long been
denigrated by historians
B. refuting criticism of two reformers made by their contemporaries by demonstrating that
those criticisms are baseless
C. providing evidence to support a claim that historians’ understanding of a particular
phenomenon may be incomplete
D. discussing some of the reasons that two reformers who were well-known during their
lifetimes are considered by historians today to have been ineffective
E. suggesting an alternative interpretation of the effect of the farm tenancy system on the
economy of the rural South following the Civil War
2. The author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements
concerning Smith and Clayton?
A. More research is required to determine whether or not their organizations were typical of
those established to aid African American framers in the post-Civil War rural South
B. Their contributions to the improvement of the living conditions of African American framers
were overshadowed by subsequent political controversy
C. Their achievements as reformers have been exaggerated by many historians of the post-
Civil War period
D. There is evidence demonstrating that they were committed to aiding African American
farmers in the rural South.
E. The extent of the criticism made about them by their contemporaries is difficult to
determine.
98


 Passage 82
TEB Attorney: TEB Corporation has been accused of not doing enough to discourage its 
executives from defrauding the government. This accusation is obviously false, since TEB, 
following its own written policy, rewards those who report the wrongdoing of others and 
promptly fires proven wrongdoers.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the attorney’s argument in defense 
of TEB? 
A. “Wrongdoing” is defined in TEB corporate policies as “any activity by a TEB employee that
defrauds TEB.”
B. TEB has instituted what it calls “customer friendly” policies of responding to every complaint
customers make
C. The government is not TEB’ s sole client, nor even its major client.
D. Defrauding the government would have to involve more than one employee of any company
that did so.
E. Those who have accused TEB of not doing enough to discourage its executives from
defrauding the government have themselves been government employees.
Passage 83
Throughout much of the Tertiary period( most of the past 65 million years), the Arctic 
supported continuous forests. Only toward the end of that period does the fossil evidence 
show that certain present-day Arctic plants were established and widely distributed 
throughout the Arctic. Many Arctic plants are thought to have originated in the high mountain 
ranges of central Asia and North America, to have spread northward to the Arctic as global 
temperatures fell in the late Tertiary, and to have achieved a circumpolar distribution by the 
end of the Tertiary(about 2 million years ago). However, fossil evidence to support these 
proposals is either lacking or fragmentary. Consequently, the routes by which these plants 
expanded their ranges during their colonization of the Arctic remain unknown.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. Which of the following statements about Arctic plants is supported by the passage?
A. The decline in global temperature in the late Tertiary prevented many high-mountain plants
from becoming established in the Arctic.
B. There is not enough evidence to firmly establish the historical migration routes of present-
day Arctic plants.
C. Present-day Arctic plants are less likely to leave fossil remains than are plants outside the
Arctic
2. The context in which it appears, “distributed” most nearly means
A. developed
B. isolated
C. dispersed
D. divided
E. disconnected
99


 Passage 84
Like Germany, but unlike other European nations, Norway industrialized rather late in the 
nineteenth century. Compared to Germany, however, Norway has a comparatively recent 
history of industrially based social classes and a much longer history of rather egalitarian class 
relations. The origin of Norwegian egalitarian predates industrialism and the rise of the labor 
movement. The preindustrial economy was based largely on a small independent peasantry 
who combined agriculture with fishing (in the north) or with forestry (in the south). Because 
Norway was under foreign rule for five centuries until 1905, and because the topography is 
unfavorable for large estates, a strong aristocracy and landowner class did not emerge in most 
of Norway. There were some exceptions to this pattern, especially in the southern regions 
where a landowner class did exist. Norway’s early social and economic history engendered 
egalitarianism, although, as has been pointed out by several observers, it was an equality of 
poverty.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with discussing the
A. link between poverty and equality in the preindustrial state
B. characteristics of industrial society shared by Norway and Germany
C. effects of industrialization on social and economic relations in Norway
D. roots of social equality in Norway
E. emergence of social classes in Norway and Germany
2. According to the passage, northern and southern Norway differed in which of the following
ways in the nineteenth century?
A. a landowning class was more likely to be found in southern Norway than in northern
Norway.
B. Southern Norwegian peasants relied primarily on fishing for subsistence, while Northern
Norwegians relied on forestry.
C. agriculture was a significant activity in southern Norway but not in northern Norway
D. Southern Norway industrialized earlier than did northern Norway
E. foreign rule effected southern Norway more profoundly than it did northern Norway
3. The passage suggests which of the following about egalitarianism in Norway?
A. It was a source of social stability that helped Norway survive five centuries of foreign rule
B. It manifested itself in the same way after industrialization as it had prior to industrialization
C. It did not necessarily provide a high standard of living for most Norwegians
D. It produced a Norwegian industrialization that differed qualitatively from industrialization in
other European countries in that the labor movement was less radical in Norway
E. It was more pervasive in southern than in northern Norway

 Passage 85
The Rivera Art Museum recently began charging admission. The resulting decline in visitors 
has been far larger than at other local museums, which have also begun charging admission. 
The magnitude of the decline might be due to the Rivera’ s location near government offices. 
Because an admission charge is most discouraging to those who plan a short visit, it is likely 
that government workers who formerly made brief visits during lunchtime and after work now 
do not.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the proposed explanation?
A. The fee for admission to the Rivera is no larger than that charged by other museums
B. The Rivera does not keep track of how long individual visitors stay in the museum
C. The decline in visitors to the Rivera has been no greater in workdays than it has been on
nonworking days
D. The museum with the smallest decline in visitors is the most popular with visitors from other
countries
E. In the period between the announcement that there would be an admissions charge and its
actual introduction, there was an increase in visitors at the Rivera.
Passage 86
The surface of Venus contains calcite, a mineral that absorbs the gas sulfur dioxide. Sulfur 
dioxide is often produced by volcanic activity and is plentiful in Venus’ atmosphere, so there 
must be a source, perhaps volcanic, producing sulfur dioxide on Venus.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
A. In the recent past, the level of sulfur dioxide in Venus’ atmosphere was not much higher
than it is now.
B. If there is volcanic activity on the surface of Venus, it is not adequate to maintain the
observed amount of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere.
C. The sulfur dioxide in Venus’ atmosphere forms clouds that prevent direct observation of the
surface.
D. Sulfur dioxide produced by volcanic activity on the Earth’s surface is also absorbed by
minerals other than calcite.
E. The calcite on the surface of Venus is in sufficient supply to continue to absorb sulfur for
millions of years to come.

 Passage 87
What accounts for the low-lying, flat surface of Mars’s north? On Earth’s surface, higher- and 
lower-lying areas have different types of crust: one, thin and dense, is pulled toward Earth’s 
center more strongly by gravity, and the planet’s water naturally comes to sit over it, creating 
oceans. The processes that generate this oceanic crust drive plate tectonics.
Is Mars’s north similarly characterized by a sort of crust different from other areas of the 
planet? Some researchers do see signs of tectonic activity surrounding the northern basin that 
suggest that it was created through the formation of new crust, like ocean basins on Earth. 
However, McGill points to Northern bedrock structures that predate the features said to mark 
the start of the tectonic process. McGill instead believes that through some novel mechanism 
the ancient surface sank to its current depth as a single unit. This would explain why features 
around the basin’s edge, which would have formed as the surface dropped, seem to be 
younger than structures at its floor.
The third possibility is that the northern lowlands result from impacts. Some researchers 
suggest they formed as a series of big overlapping impact craters. Others arguing that the 
odds against such a pattern of impacts are large, postulate a single event-the impact of an 
object bigger than any asteroid the solar system now contains.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. explore an analogy between aspects of the geology of Mars and the geology of Earth
B. describe how a certain feature of Mars’s surface formed
C. point out the effect that new data has had on a scientific investigation
D. summarize potential explanations of a large-scale geological feature
E. present the rationale for a scientist’s theory and expose some of its weakness
2. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about geological features on Earth
A. the relative elevation of the lowest-lying regions of the crust arises in part from forces
generated within the planet
B. the difference in elevation between the ocean basins and their surroundings is greater than
the difference between Mars’s northern basin and its surroundings
C. the formation of low-lying areas proceeds by a different process than the one that created
Mars’s northern basin
D. the weight of the oceans does not affect the depth of the ocean basins
E. the proportions of the crust that is oceanic crust is increasing
3. As presented in the passage, McGill’s account of the formation of Mars’s northern basin
differs from the other mentioned in that it alone
A. explains the formation of certain northern bedrock features
B. does not specify the force that caused the northern basin to be lower than its surroundings
C. takes the northern basin to be a landform that is not analogous to any found on Earth
D. denies that features around the northern basin are the result of tectonic activity
E. attributes the creation of the northern lowlands to processes occurring within the planet

 Passage 88
The waters east of Cape Hangklip were once the center of a lucrative wild-caught abalone 
fishery, but illegal fishing in the mid-1990s escalated to such levels that the recreational fishery 
was closed in 2003. When abalones did not rebound, commercial fishing was also banned. 
Continual declines in abalone were attributed to poaching, but an invasion by rock lobsters 
during the early 1990s probably intensified the trend. Rock lobsters prey on sea urchins, and 
increased rock lobster densities coincided with significant decreases in urchins. In that area, 
urchins feed largely by trapping drift kelp, and in doing so provide juvenile abalone with both 
protective shelter and nourishment. Without urchins’ presence, juvenile abalones are less 
likely to survive to adulthood.
1. According to the passage, since the early 1990s, sea urchins in the waters east of Cape
Hangklip have
A. significantly changed their feeding habits
B. suffered increased predation from a certain species
C. experienced increased competition for kelp, their main source of nourishment
D. seen a sharp decline in the availability of kelp, due to environmental changes
E. rebounded as commercial fishing in the region has declined
2. According to the passage, which of the following is a true statement about the feeding
behaviors of sea urchins
A. They change according to the type of food available in an area.
B. They are responsible for the decline of abalones in some regions.
C. They have a significant impact on the young of another species.
D. They make sea urchins more vulnerable to potential predators.
E. They result in marked decline in certain regions.
3. Which of the following statements about the Closing of the ‘‘recreational ﬁshery’’ is supported by
the passage?
A. It was a measure taken in response to the invasion of the area by rock lobsters.
B. It had unintended effects on the region’s population of sea urchins.
C. It was enacted after the banning of commercial ﬁshing in the region.
D. It did not stem the decline of abalone in the region.
E. It had a short-lived effect on the area’s abalone population.
4. It can be inferred from the passage that the decline of abalones in the waters east of Cape
Hangklip was probably due in part to
A. an increase in the area’s population of rock lobsters
B. illegal harvesting of adult abalones in the area
C. a change in the feeding behavior of sea urchins
Passage 89
Some conservationists, concerned about the rapid depletion through poachingof elephant 
herds in certain parts of Africa, are urging countries to which ivory is sold to ban ivory 
importation. This ban, they argue, would prevent ivory sellers from reaching their market, and 
elephant herds would have a chance to recover. 
The conservationists’ recommendation as described is based on which of the following 
assumptions?
A. The capacity of any illegal channels that may exist for the sale of ivory in export markets
cannot expand to meet demand in those markets
103


B. There now exist synthetic substitutes for ivory that are essentially indistinguishable from the
natural product
C. Bans on imports of ivory need to be combined with intensified efforts to stop poaching in
order to be effective
D. To the economies of those countries that have significant elephant herds, elephants are
more valuable alive than dead
E. In some parts of Africa where poaching has depleted elephant herds, those herds are
already beyond recovery
Passage 90
One of the reasons why many early British colonies in North America failed amid the New 
World’s abundance was that the settlers’ mindset prevented them from living like the native 
inhabitants. From Native Americans, the settlers learned such skills as building brushwood 
weirs to trap fish, but they did not adopt the real key to success: mobility. The whole 
intellectual foundation of European civilization was fixity- a worldview profoundly different from 
that of Native Americans, who moved in response to changing food resources. Settlers were 
drawn to North America by tales its extraordinary abundance, not realizing that abundance is 
seasonal. Culture and ecological knowledge allowed Native Americans to exploit different food 
sources at different time of year.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. The author suggests which of the following about the early British colonies in North America
that failed?
A. Their inhabitants’ worldview was deeply affected with native people and practices
B. Their inhabitants experienced critical food shortages in part because their culture hindered
their ability to exploit seasonally available resources.
C. Their longevity would have been greater had the inhabitants adopted more of the fishing
technologies used by Native Americans
2. The author mentions “brushwood weirs” primarily in order to
A. demonstrate that Native Americans provided certain forms of assistance to colonial settlers
B. identify a skill that allowed Native Americans to thrive in regions where colonies failed to
C. distinguish the kinds of technologies used by Native Americans from those used by colonial
settlers
D. acknowledge that colonial settlers adopted certain American ways even though they failed
in the New World
E. contrast the assumptions of British colonial settlers and Native Americans in the New World
104


 Passage 91 
A mouse’s immune system generally rejects proteins different from those produced by that 
mouse. The immune system of a pregnant mouse does not, however, reject the mouse’s 
fetuses, although the fetal tissue a fetus produces as it develops typically contains many such 
proteins. Some scientists hypothesize that the placenta surrounding the fetus physically blocks 
the mother’s immune system. But others, noting that the placenta produces IDO, an enzyme 
that suppresses the immune system, hypothesize that IDO plays a crucial role in protecting the 
fetus.
In order to choose between the two hypotheses, it would be most useful to determine which of 
the following?
A. Whether mice sometimes produce IDO when they are not pregnant
B. Whether the immune systems of fetal mice are capable of attacking the tissue of the mother
C. Whether there are cases in which the immune system of a pregnant mouse rejects some
fetuses but not others
D. Whether IDO is the only substance capable of suppressing the immune system produced
by mice
E. Whether the immune systems of pregnant mice that are given a drug that inhibits IDO
production subsequently reject the fetus.
Passage 92
Most popularizations of science actually do more harm than good. Why? The single most 
important feature of scientific work is not this or that specific result. Instead, what science 
accomplishes--and what physics in particular accomplishes so beautifully--is the linking of 
diverse phenomena, the binding together of a myriad of predictions and explanations. What 
nearly all popularizations do is systematically undermine the progressive reasoning that links 
principles, conventions, experiments, and laws. Bad science writing splinters the most 
interesting feature of science, its long run of connected argumentation, into isolated metaphors 
that last just long enough to evoke a particular result: black holes are said to be huge funnels 
and quantum electron orbits are characterized as diffuse clouds.
The author of the passage mentions black holes in order to provide
A. an instance of a factual error to which popularizations of science are prone
B. a metaphor for the emptiness typical of most popular science writing
C. a case in which a metaphor for a scientific process leads to a misunderstanding of that
process
D. an example of the metaphorical explanations the author believes are typical of bad science
writing
E. an illustration of a complex phenomenon for which most readers require simplified
explanations
105


 Passage 93
The use of nets at beach resorts to protect swimming areas from sharks has been criticized by 
environmentalists because the nets needlessly kill thousands of marine animals annually. 
However, environmentalists have recently discovered that an electrified cable buried beneath 
the periphery of swimming areas causes sharks to swim away while harming neither humans 
nor marine life. Hence, by installing such cables, resort communities will be able to maintain 
tourism while satisfying environmentalists' concerns.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A. Many seaside resort communities where sharks have never been sighted nonetheless paid
to install buried electrified cables.
B. Tourism at resorts where sharks have been sighted has suffered only slightly despite the
fact that many people claim to fear sharks.
C. Because they have a strong fear of sharks, many tourists prefer to swim at beaches that
are known to be well protected from sharks.
D. The buried electrified cable is not the only innovation approved by environmentalists that is
known to be successful in repelling sharks without harming them
E. The marine mammals that are a major tourist attraction at many resorts do not enter areas
around which there are buried electrified cables.
106


 Passage 94
In general, naive individuals appear more likely to learn from interaction with familiar rather 
than unfamiliar members of their species. Kaveliers and colleagues (2005) reported that naive 
laboratory-bred deer mice showed greater social learning of defensive responses to biting flies 
after observing responses of familiar members than after observing responses of unfamiliar 
members. Earlier, Valsecchi and colleagues (1996) reported striking differences in social 
learning of food preferences among Mongolian gerbils, depending on whether they were 
exposed to familiar or unfamiliar demonstrators. At the time, this was unexpected because 
Gaief and colleagues (1984) had previously reported no familiarity effect in Norway rats on 
social learning of food preferences. However, Gaief et al (1998) subsequently uncovered a 
significant familiarity effect that was evident when demonstrators are some hours before 
interacting with observers but absent when demonstrators are immediately before interacting.
Which of the following can be inferred about the report by Gaief and colleagues (1984) as it is 
described in the passage?
A. It introduced a concept that the report by Kaveliers and colleagues was intended to clarify.
B. It highlighted an inaccuracy in the report by Valsecchi and colleagues
C. It led to an incorrect supposition on the part of some scientists
D. It played an important role in developing an understanding of social learning between
members of different species.
E. It suggested that the familiarity effect is stronger in some species than in others.
Passage 95
While historian Linda Nicholson sees women's participation in voluntary associations as 
activities consistent with the increasing relegation of women’s lives to a separate, “private” 
sphere in nineteenth-century Europe, historian Katherine Lynch argues that these kinds of 
activities enabled women to join with one another and to develop a kind of shadow citizenship 
within civil society, if not the formal state. These kinds of experiences were no substitute for 
actual political entitlements, Lynch suggests, but they deserve more attention for their 
importance in helping individuals forge enduring bonds of community and identity beyond 
domestic life. Only by limiting one’s notion of public life to formal political participation, she 
says, can one conclude that most women in Western society have ever been literally 
consigned to a separate or “private” sphere.
1. The phrase “These kinds of experiences” in the passage refers to experiences in Lynch’s
view are
A. an early stage in women’s political participation
B. insufficiently appreciated for their role in women’s public life
C. properly assigned to the “private” sphere
D. a means of altering the political structure
E. historically atypical for women in Western society
2. The passage implies that Lynch would agree that formal political participation
A. was increasingly important as the nineteenth century progressed
B. was an underreported phenomenon among women in nineteenth century Europe within civil
society
C. is crucial to helping individuals form community ties
D. is a significant component of public life
E. is indicative of a kind of shadow citizenship
107


 Passage 96
In the 1600s there was intense competition in Europe to discover how to make porcelain. The 
two groups of Europeans working in China—Dutch merchants and French missionaries—each 
tried to discover the Chinese manufacturers’ secrets. The first French missionary journal, was 
not published until 1717, several years after European porcelain manufacture began. 
Therefore, rather than copying the Chinese techniques, the European manufacturers must 
have learned by experiment.
Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for the argument?
A. The techniques used by the first European makers of porcelain were essentially identical to
techniques that Chinese porcelain maker used.
B. The first European-manufactured porcelain items were comparable in quality to some of the
lower-quality porcelain that was then being imported into Europe from China.
C. The manuscript from which the 1717 journal article was published had been written down
by French missionaries in China and sent to France some years before 1717.
D. The particular raw materials that are needed to make porcelain were not used in European
ceramic making until the manufacture of porcelain began.
E. The first porcelain factory in Europe was founded in Germany by a manufacturer who had
no channels of communication with China or Europeans working in China.
Passage 97
Editors of major United States newsmagazines have been criticized for reducing the amount of 
space these magazines devote to international news. According to these editors, however, 
readers are wholly to blame for the reductions. After all, the editors point out, sales of 
magazine issues that prominently feature international news stories have declined 
significantly, and declining sales reflect declining reader interest. Yet even if true, this 
evidence does not refute the contention that editors are merely passive instruments 
responding to reader interest. And that is clearly an untenable view, since editors can often 
intensify reader interest in a news topic by giving it frequent coverage.
In the argument as a whole, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles?
A. The first is evidence that has been used to support a position that the argument opposes;
the second is a point that the argument raises to cast doubt on the reasoning used to support
that position.
B. The first presents a claim, the truth of which is evaluated in the argument; the second is
information introduced to cast doubt on that claim.
C. The first presents a claim, the truth of which is evaluated in the argument; the second
provides evidence in support of that claim.
D. The first cites evidence in support of the main conclusion of the argument; the second
states that conclusion.
E. The first states an assumption that is explicitly made to support the main conclusion of the
argument; the second is a position that the argument as a whole opposes.
108


 Passage 98
The crustaceans known as harpacticoids are very widespread in marine sediments, where 
they feed on microorganisms by ingesting the sediment particles to which the microorganisms 
adhere. Heavy metals, such as those found in industrial pollution, readily adhere to sediment 
particles. Harpacticoids are poisoned by heavy metals but are unaffected by most other 
pollutants. Therefore the concentration of harpacticoids in an area is a good indication of 
whether that marine environment contains heavy metals.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?
A. Industrial pollution is the principal source of heavy metals in marine sediments.
B. Harpacticoids are the only crustaceans that feed on microorganisms by ingesting sediment
particles.
C. Harpacticoids are more susceptible to poisoning by heavy metals than are other marine
organisms.
D. The microorganisms that harpacticoids feed on are not killed by pollutants that are
harmless to harpacticoids.
E. The microorganisms that harpacticoids feed on absorb heavy metals.
Passage 99
Orcas are small whales that generally travel in groups called pods. Orcas that feed on marine 
mammals travel in very small pods, while those that feed on fish travel in relatively large pods. 
Since a larger pod has an increased collective ability to locate prey, it is likely that orcas that 
feed on mammals travel in small pods only because the mammals that they hunt can more 
easily detect a large pod and escape it.
Which of the following, if true, most strongly indicates that the conclusion is too sweeping?
A. Orcas that feed on fish almost always remain in the pod into which they were born, while
orcas that feed on mammals will form new pods if the one they are in becomes too big.
B. No orcas have been observed to switch back and forth between feeding on fish and feeding
on mammals.
C. Pods of orcas generally include at least on mother and one or two of her offspring.
D. Unlike marine mammals, fish generally travel in large schools, which can provide food for
large pods of orcas.
E. Individuals from different pods interact frequently, and pods are small, such interaction
predominantly foraging activities.
109


 Passage 100
The male lion’s mane consists of hair of varying length and color, covering, to varying degrees, 
the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. Schaller suggested that the mane protects the area of 
the body “towards which most social contact is directed” by absorbing blows and bites. Darker 
mane hairs are thicker than lighter hairs, so darker manes may provide better protection. 
These ideas suggest that males with longer and darker manes will be wounded less frequently 
and/or with less severity on the area covered by the mane, but direct tests of this prediction 
are difficult. Individual males are seldom seen daily, and the mane itself obscures many 
wounds beneath it from view. Furthermore, even in the best studied population, serious fights 
between lions are rarely observed.
1. Which of the following best describe the function of the highlighted portion of the passage？
A. to summarize the results of an experiment
B. to provide evidence on which a particular prediction is offered
C. to offer a counterexample that undermines a propelled explanation
D. to identify a phenomenon that Schaller found difficult to explain
E. to explain the variation among individual lo manes
2. The passage mentions which of the following as an obstacle to verify the “prediction”
mentioned in the passage?
A. Wounds to the mane area are often difficult to observe.
B. Only a few lion populations have been well studied.
C. The severity of fights between lions is difficult to determine.
D. Individual males seldom have strong distinguishing characteristics.
E. Researchers have relatively few opportunities to observe lion populations directly.
110


 Passage 101 
This passage is adapted from material published in 1993
The recent recognition of a link between increasing rates of deforestation and increasing 
global climatic warming has focused new attention on the ecological role of forests. 
Deforestation threatens the continued existence of forests, and their loss would lead to an 
immediate, irreversible destabilization of the climate because the destruction of forests 
contributes to increased atmospheric concentrations of such heat-trapping gases as carbon 
dioxide and therefore to the acceleration of global warming.
The world is at present accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from two well-known 
sources the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Deforestation results in higher levels 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere because the carbon stored in plants and trees is released 
when trees decay or are burned. A third sources, the warming-enhanced decay of organic 
matter in forests and soils, especially in the middle and higher latitudes, is now being 
recognized as potentially significant. Evidence is accumulating that carbon from this source is 
beginning to have global effects. Thus, two of the three sources of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere are directly related to the survival and health of forests.
In the discussion about the importance of forests, however, emphasize has fallen on 
biodiversity, or numbers of species per unit area, especially in the tropics, where such diversity 
is particularly high. But forests, it should be emphasized, have a similar role in every latitude 
they contain the largest numbers of different kinds of plants and animals of any community on 
land and might be considered the most highly developed of the terrestrial communities from 
the standpoint of complexity of structure and diversity of life and life forms. Forests are far 
more than simple collections of species, however, it is unfortunate that the discussion of biotic 
or living resources has been focused on biodiversity rather than on the actual ability of the 
land itself to support life. In order for the complete range of plant and animal life to thrive, the 
soil must contain essential nutrients in their proper quantities and proportions, and the 
atmosphere must be composed of the correct molecules in their proper proportions. If the soils 
were to become infertile and the atmosphere inhospitable, more than mere diversity or 
numbers of species would be lost, the land would become impoverished and no longer be able 
to support any life.
Deforestation almost invariably speeds up the loss of nutrients into watercourses. It also, as 
previously explained, involves a release of carbon into the atmosphere. Forests thus play a 
clear and critical role in helping to protect the capacity of the land to support life by increasing 
the retention of nutrients and in helping to stabilize the atmosphere by storing carbon.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with discussing the
A. importance of forests for protection the land and atmosphere
B. role of forests in the tropics versus that in the higher latitudes.
C. process of deforestation in the tropics
D. need for forests to ensure the preservation of biodiversity
E. negative effects of recent global climatic changes in forests.
2. According to the passage, the emphasis on preserving biodiversity in forests has had which
of the following effects?
A. diverted attention from the importance of the land’s ability to support life.
B. led to recognition of the causes complexity of terrestrial communities.
C. led to an understanding of the causes of accelerated rates of global warming.
D. resulted in the formulation of the concept of biotic resources.
E. shifted attention away from the role of forests in stopping the accumulation of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.
111


3. The passage suggests that the emphasis on a forests biodiversity has had which of the
following unfortunate consequences?
A. It has fostered the view that forests have a similar role in every climate.
B. It has fostered the view that deforestation almost invariably speeds erosion
C. It has fostered resistance to preserving any forests but tropical ones.
D. It has led to an increase in the rate at which the land is becoming impoverished
E. It has led to an underestimation of the importance of some forests
4. The primary purpose of the third paragraph of the passage is to
A. explain how the land supports life
B. explain what happens when soil becomes infertile
C. explain why a certain development in the discussion of forests is regrettable
D. show that forests are far more than simple collections species
E. argue that forests with a small number of species are more important to the support of than
forests with many species
112


 Passage 102
A divide between aesthetic and technical considerations has played a crucial role in 
mapmaking and cartographic scholarship. Since nineteenth century cartographers, for 
instance, understood themselves as technicians who did not care about visual effects, while 
others saw themselves as landscape painters. That dichotomy structured the discipline of the 
history of cartography. Until the 1980s, in what Blakemore and Harley called “the Old is 
Beautiful Paradigm,” scholars largely focused on maps made before 1800, marveling at their 
beauty and sometimes regretting the decline of the pre-technical age. Early mapmaking was 
considered art while modern cartography was located within the realm of engineering utility. 
Alpers, however, has argued that this boundary would have puzzled mapmakers in the 
seventeenth century, because they considered themselves to be visual engineers.
1. According to the passage, Alpers would say that the assumptions underlying the “paradigm”
were
A. inconsistent with the way some mapmakers prior to 1800 understand their own work
B. dependent on a seventeenth-century conception of mapmaking visual engineering
C. unconcerned with the difference between the aesthetic and technical questions of
mapmaking
D. insensitive to divisions among cartographers working in the period after 1800
E. supported by the demonstrable technical superiority of mapmaking made after 1800
2. It can be inferred from the passage that, beginning in the 1980s, historians of cartography
A. placed greater emphasis on the beauty of maps made after 1800
B. expanded their range of study to include more material created after 1800
C. grew more sensitive to the way mapmakers prior to 1800 conceived of their work
D. came to see the visual details of maps as aesthetic objects rather than practical
cartographic aids
E. reduced the attention they paid to the technical aspects of mapmaking
113


 Passage 103
Most mammals reach sexual maturity when their growth rates are in decline, whereas humans 
experience a growth spurt during adolescence. Whether apes experience an adolescent 
growth spurt is still undecided. In the 1950s, data on captive chimpanzees collected by James 
Gavan appeared devoid of evidence of an adolescent growth spurt in these apes. In a recent 
reanalysis of Gavan’s data, however, zoologist Elizabeth Watts has found that as chimpanzees 
reach sexual maturity, the growth rate of their limbs accelerates. Most biologists, however, are 
skeptical that this is a humanlike adolescent growth spurt. While the human adolescent growth 
spurt is physically obvious and affects virtually the entire body, the chimpanzee’s increased 
growth rate is detectable only through sophisticated mathematical analysis. Moreover, 
according to scientist Holly Smith, the growth rate increase in chimpanzees begins when 86% 
of full skeletal growth has been attained, whereas human adolescence generally commences 
when 77 percent of full skeletal growth has occurred.
1. Which of the following best describes the main idea of the passage?
A. Researchers have long disagreed about whether data collected in the 1950s indicate that
chimpanzees and other apes experience an adolescent growth spurt.
B. Research data collected on chimpanzees living in captivity are inconclusive with respect to
chimpanzees living in the wild.
C. The notion that apes do not experience an adolescent growth spurt has been confirmed by
research conducted since.
D. Although the idea that apes experience an adolescent growth has received some support,
most biologists remain unconvinced.
E. Although researchers agree that chimpanzees do not experience an adolescent growth
spurt, they are divided in their opinions of whether this is true of other apes.
2. The passage mentions which of the following as one of the reasons why most biologists
remain skeptical that chimpanzees experience a humanlike adolescent growth spurt?
A. Chimpanzees do not experience a demonstrable increase in growth rate until they are fully
sexually mature.
B. The increase in growth rate that chimpanzees undergo at sexual maturity is less apparent
than that of humans.
C. The increase in growth rate once regarded as a humanlike adolescent growth spurt in
chimpanzees is too sporadic to be regarded as significant.
D. Not all chimpanzees undergo a calculable growth spurt.
E. Watt’s approach to analyzing data is considered to be highly unorthodox.
3. The passage suggests which of the following about the adolescent growth spurt that takes
place in humans?
A. Its primary effects are found in parts of the body other than the limbs.
B. It is generally completed by the time 77 percent of full skeletal growth is attained.
C. It is normally detectable without the assistance of sophisticated mathematical analysis.
D. The rate of growth is much faster at the beginning of puberty than at any other time.
E. The estimated growth rate varies depending on the methods of measurement that are used.
114


 Passage 104
Many cultural anthropologists have come to reject the scientific framework of empiricism 
that dominated the field until the 1970s and now regard all scientific knowledge as socially 
constructed. They argue that information about cultures during the empiricist era typically 
came from anthropologists who brought with them a prepackaged set of conscious and 
unconscious biases. Cultural anthropology, according to the post-1970s critique, is 
unavoidably subjective, and the anthropologist should be explicit in acknowledging that fact. 
Anthropology should stop striving to build a better database about cultural behavior and 
should turn to developing a more humanistic interpretation of cultures. The new framework 
holds that it may be more enlightening to investigate the biases of earlier texts than to 
continue with empirical methodologies.
1. The author implies which of the following about most cultural anthropologists working prior
to the 1970s?
A. They argued that scientific knowledge was socially constructed.
B. They were explicit in acknowledging the biases inherent in scientific investigation.
C. They regarded scientific knowledge as consisting of empirical truths.
D. They shared the same conscious and unconscious biases.
E. They acknowledged the need for a new scientific framework.
2. According to the passage, “many cultural anthropologists” today would agree that
anthropologists should
A. build a better, less subjective database about cultural behavior
B. strive to improve the empirical methodologies used until the 1970s
C. reject the notion that scientific knowledge is socially constructed
D. turn to examining older anthropological texts for unacknowledged biases
E. integrate humanistic interpretations with empirical methodologies

 Passage 105
Writing about nineteenth-century women’s travel writing, Lila Harper notes that the four women 
she discussed used their own names, in contrast with the nineteenth-century female novelists 
who either published anonymously or used male pseudonyms. The novelists doubtlessly 
realized that they were breaking boundaries, whereas three of the four daring, solitary 
travelers espoused traditional values, eschewing radicalism and women’s movements. 
Whereas the female novelists criticized their society, the female travelers seemed content to 
leave society as it was while accomplishing their own liberation. In other words, they lived a 
contradiction. For the subjects of Harper’s study, solitude in both the private and public 
spheres prevailed—a solitude that conferred authority, hitherto a male prerogative, but that 
also precluded any collective action or female solidarity.
1. Which of the following best characterizes the “contradiction” that the author refers to?
A. The subjects of Harper’s study enjoyed solitude, and yet as travelers they were often
among people.
B. Nineteenth-century travel writers used their own names, but nineteenth-century novelists
used pseudonyms.
C. Women’s movements in the nineteenth-century were not very radical in comparison with
those of the twentieth-century.
D. Nineteenth-century female novelists thought they were breaking boundaries, but it was the
nineteenth-century women who traveled alone who were really doing so.
E. While traveling alone in the nineteenth-century was considered a radical act for a woman,
the nineteenth-century solitary female travelers generally held conventional views.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. According to the passage, solitude had which of the following effects for the nineteenth
century female travelers?
A. It conferred an authority typically enjoyed only by men.
B. It prevented formation of alliances with other women.
C. It relieved peer pressure to conform to traditional values.
116


 Passage 106
Although vastly popular during its time, much nineteenth-century women’s fiction in the United 
States went unread by the twentieth-century educated elite, who were taught to ignore it as 
didactic. However, American literature has a tradition of didacticism going back to its Puritan 
roots, shifting over time from sermons and poetic transcripts into novels, which proved to be 
perfect vehicles for conveying social values. In the nineteenth century, critics reviled Poe 
for neglecting to conclude his stories with pithy moral tags, while Longfellow was 
canonized for his didactic verse. Although rhetorical changes favoring the anti-didactic can 
be detected as nineteenth-century American transformed itself into a secular society, it was 
twentieth-century criticism, which placed aesthetic value above everything else, that had no 
place in its doctrine for the didacticism of others.
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It explains why the fiction mentioned in the first sentence was not popular in the twentieth
century.
B. It assists in drawing a contrast between nineteenth-century and twentieth-century critics.
C. It provides an example of how twentieth – century readers were taught to ignore certain
literature.
D. It questions the usefulness of a particular distinction between Poe and Longfellow made by
critics.
E. It explains why Poe’s stories were more popular than Longfellow’s verse during the
nineteenth century.
2. In the context in which it appears, “conveying” most nearly means
A. carrying
B. transferring
C. granting
D. imparting
E. projecting
117


 Passage 107
During the Pleistocene epoch, several species of elephants isolated on islands underwent 
rapid dwarfing. This phenomenon was not necessarily confined to the Pleistocene, but may 
have occurred much earlier in the Southeastern Asian islands, although evidence is 
fragmentary. Several explanations are possible for this dwarfing. For example, islands often 
have not been colonized by large predators or are too small to hold viable predator 
populations. Once free from predation pressure, large body size is of little advantage to 
herbivores. Additionally, island habitats have limited food resources, a smaller body size and a 
need for fewer resources would thus be favored. Interestingly, the island rule is reversed for 
small mammals such as rodents, for which gigantism is favored under insular conditions.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. question the plausibility of one explanation sometimes offered for the dwarfing of certain
species living on islands
B. argue that dwarfing of certain species living on islands occurred prior to the Pleistocene
C. cite evidence suggesting that dwarfing may have adverse consequences for some species
living on islands
D. present some possible explanations for the dwarfing of certain species living on islands
E. contrast the effects of insular conditions on species with large body size and species with
small body
2. According to the passage, which of the following statements about body size in mammals is
true?
A. A large body is unfavorable to mammalian species’ survival under most conditions.
B. A large body tends to benefit small mammals living on islands.
C. For most herbivorous mammals, a large body size is easier to sustain in the absence of
large predators.
D. Under most conditions, a small body is less beneficial to herbivorous mammals than to
nonherbivorous mammals.
E. Among nonherbivorous mammals, a small body is more beneficial on an island than on a
mainland.
118


 Passage 108
In the early twentieth century, small magazines and the innovative graphics used on them 
created the face of the avant-guard. It was a look that signaled progressive ideas and 
unconventionality because it dispensed with the cardinal rule of graphic design: to take an 
idea and make it visually clear, concise, and instantly understood. Instead, graphics produced 
by avant-guard artists exclusively for the avant-guard (as opposed to their advertising work) 
were usually difficult to decipher, ambiguous, or nonsensical. This overturning of convention, 
this assailing of standard graphic and typographic formats, was part of a search for intellectual 
freedom. The impulse toward liberation enabled avant-guardists to see with fresh eyes untried 
possibilities for arranging and relating words and images on paper.
1. According to the passage, the primary purpose of conventional graphic design is to
A. render unpopular ideas palatable to a wider audience
B. capture readers’ attention with bold fonts
C. communicate nonsensical notions to a wide public
D. communicate ideas as efficiently and unambiguously as possible
E. introduce previously unknown ideas to the general public
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. According to the passage, avant-guard artists of the early twentieth-century created
ambiguous or nonsensical graphics as part of an attempt to
A. expand the potential for expression through visual art
B. compete with advertisements for reader’s attention
C. encourage the expansion of small magazines
119


 Passage 109
According to Hill and Spicer, the term “nation-state” is a misnomer, since the ideal model of a 
monolingual, culturally homogeneous state has never existed, not even among Europeans, 
who invented the nation-state concept and introduced it to the rest of the world. Modern 
European states, they argue, emerged after the Renaissance through the rise of nations (i.e., 
specific ethnic groups) to positions of political and economic dominance over a number of 
other ethnic groups within the bounded political territories. The term “nation-state”, Hill and 
Spicer argue, obscures the internal cultural and linguistic diversity of states that could more 
accurately be called “conquest states.” The resurgence of multiple ethnic groups within a 
single state, Hill says, is not “potentially threating to the sovereign jurisdiction of the state,” as 
Urban and Sherzer suggest; rather, the assertion of cultural differences threatens to reveal 
ethnocentric beliefs and practices upon which conquest states were historically founded and 
thus to open up the possibility for a “nations-state” in which conquered ethnic groups enjoy 
equal rights with the conquering ethnic group but do not face the threat of persecution or 
cultural assimilation into the dominant ethnic group.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. discuss issues relating to a form of political organization by raising doubts about the
terminology used to refer to it
B. trace changes in a form of political organization by examining the evolution of the
terminology used to refer to
C. justify the continued use of an established term for an evolving form of political organization
D. question the accuracy of a new term for a form of political organization
E. compare two terms for a form of political organization
2. The author of the passage quotes Urban and Sherzer most probably in order to
A. introduce a discussion of the legal ramifications of expanding the nation-state concept
B. summarize a claim about one possible effect of asserting cultural differences within a state
C. shift the focus of discussion from internal threats that states face to external threats that
they face
D. point out similarities between the threats to states seen by Urban and Sherzer and those
seen by Hill
E. describe one way an ethnocentric practice has affected attempts to assert cultural
differences within a state
3. According to the passage, Hill and Spicer define nations as which of the following?
A. coalitions of distinct ethnic groups with similar concerns
B. distinct ethnic groups
C. culturally homogeneous states
D. linguistically diverse states
E. territorially bounded states
120


 Passage 110
From 1910 to 1913, women suffragists in the United States organized annual parades—
activity traditionally conducted by men to proclaim solidarity in some cause—not only as a 
public expression of suffragist solidarity but also a conscious transgression of the rules of 
social order: women’s very presence in the streets challenged traditional notions of femininity 
and restrictions on women’s conduct. While recognizing the parade’s rhetorical force as a 
vehicle for social change, scholars have recently begun to examine its drawbacks as a form of 
protest. Lumsden characterizes the American suffrage parade as a “double-edged sword”, 
arguing that women’s efforts to proclaim their solidarity left them open to patronizing 
commentary from press and public and to organized opposition from antisuffragists.
1. It can be inferred from the passage that men’s and women’s parades were similar in that
both
A. were employed as rhetorical vehicles for social change
B. were regarded as violating contemporary standards of public decorum
C. made participants vulnerable to organized opposition
D. were largely ineffective as forms of protest
E. were intended by their participants as public declarations of solidarity
2. The passage suggests which of the following about proponents of the “rules of social
order?”
A. They frowned upon public displays such as parades.
B. They had ulterior motives for objecting to women’s participation in suffrage parades.
C. They formed the core of the organized opposition to women suffrage.
D. They believed that it was unfeminine for women to march in suffrage parades.
E. They supported women’s rights to vote but disapprove some of the methods that suffragists
employed to gain that right.
121


 Passage 111
Unlike most Jane Austen scholarship before 1980, much recent scholarship analyzes the 
novels of Austen, who lived from 1775 to 1817, in the context of Austen’s tumultuous times, 
which saw the French and American revolutions and the Napoleonic Wars. Yet Frantz notes 
another revolution, rarely mentioned in Austen scholarship: the Great Masculine Renunciation 
that altered conventions in men’s dress and behavior. During the later eighteenth century, 
wealthy gentlemen exchanged the velvets and satins long in fashion for somber woolen suits. 
Frantz contends that this change reflected deeper cultural changes. The value once placed on 
men’s expressiveness, reflected in Mackenzie’s novel The Man of Feeling (1771), gave way to 
a preference for emotional restraint. In Austen’s novels, the heroine often struggles to glimpse 
the true nature of hero beneath his reserved exterior.
1. The author of the passage mentions The Man of Feeling (1771) in order to
A. contrast Mackenzie’s reasons for writing novels with those of Austen
B. introduce evidence regarding the influence of particular writers on Austen
C. corroborate a claim that a convention of masculine behavior changed during Austen’s
lifetime
D. suggest that Austen’s novels were more reflective of their historical context than
Mackenzie’s had been
E. challenge a particular misconception about the modes of behavior common among
gentlemen in the later eighteenth century
2. The passage suggests which of the following about scholarship on Jane Austen?
A. Much recent scholarship has begun to place greater emphasis on gender conventions
governing men’s behavior during Austen’s lifetime.
B. Some scholarship has debated whether Austen’s novels depict emotional restraint as an
admiral quality.
C. Certain scholars argue that Austen’s novels do not accurately reflect cultural changes
during Austen’s lifetime that changed the way gentlemen dressed and behaved.
D. After 1980, scholarship on Austen shifted toward a greater emphasis on the historical
context in which she wrote.
E. With few exceptions, recent scholarship depicts Austen as a writer who had little interest in
the tumultuous events of her time.
122


 Passage 112
Whereas Carlos Bulosan aimed through fiction and personal testimony to advance both 
Filipino civil rights in the United States and the social transformation of the Philippines, Yen Le 
Espiritu has set herself the task of recovering life histories of Filipino Americans. Her work 
brings Filipino Americans of the generation following the 1934-1965 immigration hiatus 
graphically to life. A special strength is the representation of Filipino American women, who 
were scarce among immigrants before the 1934 American curb on Filipino immigration but 
composed more than half of the immigrants to America since liberalization in 1965. Espiritu’s 
subjects document their changing sense of Filipino identity in the United States, much as 
Bulosan did as a member of the first substantial wave of immigrants.
1. According to the passage, both Bulosan and Espiritu do which of the following in their work?
A. consider generational differences in Filipino immigrants’ responses to life in the United
States
B. attempt to make allowance for the demographic variations among Filipino immigrants to the
United States
C. employ fiction in addition to documenting actual life histories of Filipino immigrants to the
United States
D. represent how life in the United States has affected immigrants’ sense of Filipino identity
E. examine the effects on Filipinos in the United States of the 1934 American curb on Filipino
immigration
2. In the context in which it appears, “graphically” most nearly means
A. in writing
B. by means of drawing
C. impressionistically
D. diagrammatically
E. vividly
123


 Passage 113
1800 Thomas Dilworth’s New Guide to the English Dialogue was being widely used to teach 
reading in the United States. Dilworth's primer, unlike earlier ones, stressed the importance of 
children’s understanding what they read. While it is in fact unlikely that children would have 
recognized all the vocabulary Dilworth used, that was at least his stated goal. Dilworth 
recognized that primers should enable children to decode words from print with the form of 
language they already knew: speech. In contrast, many earlier authors assumed that, just as 
introductory Latin texts taught children an unknown language, introductory English texts 
should teach English as if it, too, were an unknown language. 
1. According to the passage, the “earlier authors” adopted a model for English instruction that
A. mirrored the practice used in Latin instruction
B. was originally formulated by Dilworth
C. was less esoteric than that adopted by Dilworth
D. stressed familiarity with the peculiarities of English spelling
E. emphasized the importance of fluent and articulate speech
2. The author of the passage would probably agree with which of the following criticisms of
English primers predating Dilworth’s?
A. Their Latinate grammatical terms poorly described the structures of English.
B. They failed to make effective use of the knowledge of language a child already possessed.
C. Their texts typically focused on subject matter that held little intrinsic interest for their
readers.
D. They neglected to teach the language in a sufficiently systematic way.
E. They required a pedagogical method that few American teachers of the era possessed.
124


 Passage 114
Many scholars have argued that government investment in manufacturing in the southern 
United States during the Second World War spurred a regional economic boom that lasted into 
the postwar period. But much of this investment went to specialized plants, many of them 
unsuitable for postwar production. Large-scale, wartime government funding led to a 
massive increase in the number and scale of munitions facilities. By the war’s end, 216 
munitions establishment costing more than $3.5 billion had been built, many of them located in 
the south. Indeed, according to one estimate, more than 70 percent of federally financed 
manufacturing construction capital in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee went 
into munitions plants.
Even in the northern regions with strong prewar manufacturing economics, these plants were 
difficult to deal with once the imperative of war had been removed. In the south few 
industrialists had the capacity or desire to transform these factories to a peacetime function. 
Accordingly, at war’s end almost all of the southern munitions facilities were shut down, placed 
on standby, operated at a very low capacity, or converted to nonmanufacturing functions, 
usually storage. Although some reopened a few years later for use during the Korean War, the 
impact of the special plants on the South’s postwar economy was marginal at best.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. propose an alternative explanation
B. challenge a widely held position
C. contrast two views of a phenomenon
D. explain why a particular claim has been influential
E. evaluate evidence used to support a particular view
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. According to the passage, some southern munitions plants built in the South during the
Second World War were
A. later reopened and used once more as munitions plants
B. used for nonmanufacturing purposes after the war
C. originally envisioned as continuing to manufacture munitions at high capacity even after the
war had ended
3. In the passage, the mention of “Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee” serves
primarily to
A. suggest that some states were better than others at anticipating postwar economic needs
B. identify evidence used to support a view held by scholars mentioned at the beginning of the
passage
C. suggest that federal investment in some kinds of manufacturing was excessive
D. identify the states that received the largest allocations of federal funds
E. provide information to support a point about the nature of government investment made
earlier in the paragraph
4. In the highlighted portion of the passage, the author notes that plants were “specialized”
primarily in order to
A. support a claim about the way in which wartime imperatives determined the amount of
government investment in southern manufacturing
B. suggest that the federal government’s investments in southern manufacturing during the Second
world war were largely ineffective
C. identify a factor that limited the impact of wartime government investment on the postwar
southern economy
D. contrast the kinds of manufacturing facilities built in southern states during the Second world
war with those built in northern states
125


E. challenge a claim about the reasons for government investment in southern manufacturing
during the Second world war
5. The author implies which of the following about the manufacturing facilities built in southern
states during the Second world war?
A. They tended to be less well-suited to conversion to peacetime purposes than were
manufacturing facilities built in northern states.
B. They had a greater impact on the wartime economies of Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and
Tennessee than on those of other southern states.
C. They temporarily allowed the southern states to surpass the northern states in creating
manufacturing jobs.
D. Few of them continued to serve their original functions during the postwar period.
E. Some of them operated at a very low capacity during as well as after the war.
6. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would disagree with the “scholars” mentioned in
the ﬁrst sentence about which of the following?
A. The extent to which the postwar southern economy beneﬁted from the wartime investment of
federal funds
B. The effect of government investment on construction of manufacturing plants in southern states
during the Second world war
C. The extent to which government-funded manufacturing facilities in the South actually beneﬁted
the United states effort to win the Second world war
D. Whether southern munitions plants built during the Second world war were converted to
nonmanufacturing functions after the war
E. Whether government investment in manufacturing in southern states during the Second world
war exceeded private investment there
126


 Passage 115
Although the passenger pigeons, now extinct, were abundant in eighteenth- and nineteenth-
century America, archaeological studies at twelfth-century Cahokian sites in the present day 
United States examined household food trash and found that traces of passenger pigeon were 
quite rare. Given that the sites were close to a huge passenger pigeon roost documented by 
John James Audubon in the nineteenth century and that Cahokians consumed almost every 
other animal protein source available, the archaeologists conducting the studies concluded 
the passenger pigeon population had once been very limited before increasing dramatically in 
post-Columbian America. Other archaeologists have criticized those conclusions on the 
grounds that passenger pigeon bones would not be likely to be preserved. But all the 
archaeological projects found plenty of bird bones and even tiny bones from fish.
1. The author of the passage mentions “tiny bones from fish” primarily in order to
A. explain why traces of passenger pigeon are rare at Cahokian sites
B. support a claim about the wide variety of animal proteins in the Cahokian diet
C. provide evidence that confirms a theory about the extinction of the passenger pigeon
D. cast doubt on the conclusion reached by the archaeologists who conducted the studies
discussed in the passage
E. counter an objection to an interpretation of the data obtained from Cahokian sites
2. Which of the following, if true, would most call into question the reasoning of “the
archaeologists conducting the studies”?
A. Audubon was unable to correctly identify twelfth-century Cahokian sites
B. Audubon made his observations before passenger pigeon populations began to decline.
C. Passenger pigeons would have been attracted to household food trash
D. Archaeologist have found passenger pigeon remains among food waste at eighteenth-
century human settlements
E. Passenger pigeons tended not to roost at the same sites for very many generations
127


 Passage 116
Feminist scholars have tended to regard women in the nineteenth-century United States who 
elected to remain single as champions of women’s autonomy and as critics of marriage as an 
oppressive institution. Indeed, many nineteenth-century American women who participated in 
reform movements or who distinguished themselves as writers and professionals were single. 
Yet this view of single women tends to distort the meaning of their choices. The nineteenth 
century saw the elevation of marriage for love as a spiritual ideal. Consequently, it became 
socially acceptable for women not to marry if such an ideal marriage could not be realized with 
an available suitor. Thus, many women’s choice to remain single reflected not a negative view 
of marriage but a highly idealistic one.
1. The author of the passage implies that many nineteenth-century American women chose to
remain single because they
A. believed that marriage required them to give up much of their autonomy
B. had attitudes toward marriage that were influenced by contemporary reform movements
C. wanted to take advantage of increasing opportunities to distinguish themselves as
professionals
D. doubted that their own marriage would live up to their notion of what a marriage ought to be
E. had a negative view of marriage fostered by a change in social attitudes during the
nineteenth century
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. The author of the passage suggests that the feminist scholars mentioned in the first
sentence distort the meaning of certain nineteenth-century American women’s choices by
A. ascribing those choices to a particular attitude toward marriage
B. ignoring evidence about single women’s motives for becoming writers or professionals
C. overestimating the number of nineteenth-century American women who were single by
choice.
128


 Passage 117
Many researchers attribute the large number of physiological and behavioral similarities 
between birds and mammals, which have separate evolutionary histories, to endothermy (a 
thermoregulatory strategy whereby warm body temperature is maintained through internal heat 
sources). However, Farmer argues that parental care rather than endothermy is the key to 
understanding the similarities between mammals and birds. According to Farmer, while 
endothermy provides an explanation for a few similarities, such as the presence of body 
insulation, endothermy is just one characteristic among many related to parental care. The two 
purported advantages of endothermy that have been most frequently cited by researchers are 
an expanded range of inhabitable environments and the ability to sustain vigorous exercise. 
But metabolism has to increase substantially (at great energy cost) therefore conferring any 
significant thermoregulatory advantage in terms of the former, and there is no causal biological 
linkage to explain why endothermy would be essential to sustain exercise. Farmer argues 
instead that endothermy evolved as a means to control incubation temperature and that the 
ability to sustain exercise evolved separately, as a means to improve a parent’s ability to 
forage and provision its young.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. present a scientific theory that challenges a widely held theory
B. summarize the basis for a large body of scientific research
C. defend an established scientific theory in light of recent criticism
D. express skepticism about the results obtained by a particular researcher
E. compare the results of two particular scientific studies
2. Which of the following best characterizes the organization of the passage as a whole?
A. A position is noted, an alternative to that position is introduced, and then several points in
support of the alternative are discussed.
B. A theory is discussed, an inconsistency within that theory is illustrated, and then a
recommendation is made for further inquiry.
C. Certain research results are described, the significance of those results is explained, and
then a novel interpretation of those results is summarized.
D. A question is posed, a possible answer to that question is suggested, and then evidence is
provided to corroborate that answer.
E. A debate is outlined, contrasting viewpoints within the debate are discussed, and then one
viewpoint is demonstrated to be correct.
3. According to the passage, Farmer concedes that endothermy provides an explanation for
which of the following features shared by birds and mammals?
A. The ability to forage
B. The ability to sustain exercise
C. The instinct to care for offspring
D. Flexibility in habitat usage
E. Body insulation
129


 Passage 118
Prominent among theories of the function of sleep is Meddis’ immobilization hypothesis, which 
holds that sleep, rather than serving a restorative function, plays a protective role during times 
that animals cannot be usefully engaged in other activities. Meddis reasoned that animals 
not immediately threatened by predators would be safer if they passed the time 
sleeping.
However, that hypothesis cannot easily explain why one often observes a rebound in sleep 
time or intensity following a period of sleep deprivation. Neither does the hypothesis explain 
the existence of various states of sleep, which themselves may be associated with different 
functions.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. According to the passage, the immobilization hypothesis fails to account for which of the
following facts?
A. That sleep does not appear to be a uniform and unchanging state
B. That under certain conditions animals appear to need more sleep than usual
C. That animals rarely sleep when a predator has been detected nearby
2. In the context of the passage as a whole, the highlighted portion serves primarily to
A. present the thinking that led scientists to qualify a widely accepted view
B. describe the basis on which a hypothesis was advanced
C. illustrate the kind of reasoning that is applied in a branch of science
D. explain how a hypothesis can be tested empirically
E. relate the analysis that refined a tentative explanation
130


 Passage 119
In 1919 Britain experienced its largest ever reduction in industrial working hours, to 48 per 
week. In Dowie’s view the 48-hour week played a central role in Britain’s poor economic 
performance during the 1920s. Dowie argued that the reduction, together with rapid wage 
growth, drove up prices. However, Greasly and Oxley found that the First World War 
(1914-1918) constituted a more powerful negative macroeconomic shock to Britain’s 
competitiveness. And Scott argues that Dowie’s thesis ignores considerable evidence that 
hourly productivity improves when hours are reduced from a high base level. Crucially, 
Dowie’s thesis does not acknowledge that hours were reduced to around 48 hours a week for 
industrial workers in most industrialized nations at this time so far—undermining any potential 
impact of reduced hours on industrial productivity relative to other nations.
1. Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for Scott’s argument?
A. Companies have generally found that part-time employees are less productive than full-time
ones.
B. When the total number of hours worked at a company increases owing to the addition of
more employees, the usual result is improved productivity at the company.
C. When the total hours worked by all employees per week in two companies are equivalent,
hourly productivity tends to be equivalent as well.
D. Companies whose employees usually work a high number of hours tend to have greater
total costs than do similar companies whose employees work fewer hours.
E. Companies have found that total output per employee is not necessarily changed by
reductions in the number of hours worked per employee.
2. It can be inferred from the passage that in the view of Greasley and Oxley
A. a reduced workweek was ultimately beneficial to employees
B. the economic effects of the reduction in working hours in 1919 were brief
C. Britain became less economically competitive in the 1920s
D. reduced working hours were the primary cause of the economic changes observed by
Dowie
E. the changes in economic performance in Britain in the 1920s were unforeseen
131


 Passage 120
The finding that there were rock-melting temperatures on asteroids for sustained periods is 
puzzling: asteroids’ heat source is unknown, and unlike planet-sized bodies, such small bodies 
quickly dissipate heat. Rubin suggests that asteroids’ heat could have derived from collisions 
between asteroids. Skeptics have argued that a single impact would raise an asteroid’s overall 
temperature very little and that asteroids would cool too quickly between impacts to 
accumulate much heat. However, these objections assumed that asteroids are dense, solid 
bodies. A recent discovery that asteroids are highly porous makes Rubin’s hypothesis more 
plausible. When solid bodies collide, much debris is ejected, dissipating energy. Impacts on 
porous bodies generate less debris, so more energy goes into producing heat. Heat could be 
retained as debris fall back into impact craters, creating an insulating blanket.
1. The passage suggests that one factor that has made it difficult to account for the
temperatures once reached by asteroids is
A. a miscalculation of the frequency of asteroid collisions
B. a misconception about asteroids’ density
C. a mistaken assumption about what the heat source of the asteroids was
D. an underestimation of the rate at which small bodies lose heat
E. an erroneous view of how asteroids were formed
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. It can be inferred from the passage that Rubin disagrees with skeptics mentioned in the
passage about which of the following?
A. Whether porous bodies generate less debris when struck than do solid bodies
B. The temperatures asteroids would have to reach for their rocks to have melted
C. The likely effect of impacts on asteroids’ temperatures
132


 Passage 121
Benjamin Franklin is portrayed in American history as the quintessential self-made man. In 
“Self-reliance”, Emerson asks, “Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin...?” In 
fact, Franklin took instruction widely, and his scientific work was highly collaborative. Friends 
in England sent equipment needed for his electrical experiments, others, in Philadelphia, 
helped him set up his workshop there. Philip Syng constructed a device for generating 
electrical charges, while Tomas Hopkinson demonstrated the potential of pointed conductors. 
Franklin, in addition to being the group’s theoretician, wrote and published its results. His 
fame as an individual researcher is partly a consequence of the shorthand by which 
when one person writes about a group’s discoveries, history sometimes grants singular 
credit for collective effort.
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It states a viewpoint about Franklin with which the author disagrees.
B. It introduces new evidence about Franklin’s role in the collaborative process.
C. It explains Franklin’s reputation in terms of a broad scholarly phenomenon.
D. It emphasizes the extent to which Franklin relied on others in his workshop.
E. It describes Franklin’s approach to writing scientific results.
2. Emerson is mentioned in the passage primarily to
A. identify the origin of a particular understanding of Franklin
B. elaborate on a view of Franklin that the author takes issue with
C. point to a controversial claim about Franklin’s historical legacy
D. introduce the question of who Franklin’s main scientific influences were
E. suggest that Franklin was resistant to collaboration with other scientists
133


 Passage 122
There have long been dead zones—water too low in oxygen to sustain most forms of life—in 
the Gulf of Mexico, which receives the waters of the Mississippi River. Scientists studied 
sediment cores from areas where the gulf’s most recent dead zone occurred. The scientists 
dated the sediment and counted species of foraminifera (marine protozoans) in the sediment; 
these species thrive in low-oxygen waters. As far back as 1823, the foraminifera thrived 
especially during Mississippi River flood years (during which nutrients levels increase), 
suggesting that nutrients in floodwaters can trigger low-oxygen water. The foraminifera in the 
core samples were most abundant after 1950, when farmers began using some fertilizer, 
which is rich in nutrients. Researchers believe that increased use of fertilizer leads to more-
extreme dead zones.

of the passage as a whole?
A. It reconciles two opposing theories that were discussed earlier in the passage.
B. It suggests what the initial impetus was for the studies mentioned earlier in the passage.
C. It undermines a hypothesis that was presented in the preceding sentence.
D. It describes a problem with the methodology of the studies discussed in the passage.
E. It provides evidence supporting the belief mentioned in the final sentence of the passage.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. It can be inferred from the passage that the “researchers” would agree with which of the
following statements about the use of fertilizer?
A. If farmers near the Mississippi River decreased the amount of fertilizer that they used, the
severity of the dead zones could be diminished.
B. If farmers near the Mississippi River continue their dependence upon fertilizers, foraminifera
population will eventually decline.
C. If farmers near the Mississippi River stopped using fertilizers altogether, there would no
longer be dead zones.

 Passage 123
Biologist know that some marine algae can create clouds by producing the gas dimethyl 
sulphide (DMS), which reacts with oxygen in air above the sea to form solid particles. These 
particles provide a surface on which water vapor can condense to form clouds. Lovelock 
contends that this process is part of global climatic-control system. According to Lovelock, 
Earth acts like a super organism, with all its biological and physical systems cooperating to 
keep it healthy. He hypothesized that warmer conditions increase algal activity and DMS 
output, seeding more clouds, which cool the planet by blocking out the Sun. Then, as the 
climate cools, algal activity and DMS level decrease and the cycle continues. In response to 
biologists who question how organisms presumably working for their own selfish ends could 
have evolved to behave in a way that benefits not only the planet but the organisms as well, 
Lovelock points out that cooling benefits the algae, which remain at the ocean surface, 
because it allows the cooled upper layers of the ocean to sink, and then the circulating water 
carries nutrients upward from the depths below. Algae may also benefit from nitrogen raining 
down from clouds they have helped to form.
1. According to the passage, which of the following occurs as a result of cooling in the upper
layers of the ocean?
A. The concentration of oxygen in the air above the ocean’s surface decreases.
B. The concentration of DMS in the air above the ocean’s surface increases.
C. The nutrient supply at the surface of the ocean is replenished.
D. Cloud formation increases over the ocean.
E. Marine algae make more efficient use of nutrients.
2. Which of the following is most similar to the role played by marine algae in the global
climate control system proposed by Lovelock?
A. a fan that continually replaces stale air in a room with fresh air from outside.
B. a thermostat that automatically controls an air-conditioning system.
C. an insulating blanket that retains heat.
D. a filter used to purify water.
E. a dehumidifier that constantly removes moisture from the air in a room.
3. The passage mentions the possible benefit to algae of nitrogen falling down in the rain most
likely in order to
A. provide support for Lovelock’s response to an objection mentioned in the passage.
B. suggest that the climatic effects of DMS production have been underestimated.
C. acknowledge that Lovelock’s hypothesis is based in part on speculation.
D. demonstrate that DMS production alters the planet in more than one way.
E. assert that algae are the sole beneficiaries of DMS production.
4. Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?
A. A question is posed, and several possible answers to the question are introduced and
evaluated.
B. A prediction is made, and certain factors that inﬂuenced that prediction are considered.
C. A sequence of events is outlined, and a possible cause for the sequence is offered.
D. A phenomenon is described, a theory about the signiﬁcance of the phenomenon is offered, and
a reservation about that theory is addressed.
E. A debate is summarized, the strengths and weaknesses of each position are described, and an
assessment of the defensibility of each is made.
5. It can be inferred from the passage that Lovelock thinks that biologists who question his
hypothesis about cyclical DMS output and algal activity make which of the following errors?
A. They do not recognize the beneﬁts that Earth receives from the activity.
B. They exaggerate the rate at which nitrogen falls from the clouds.
135


C. They assume that the algae remain near the ocean surface throughout the cycle.
D. They overlook the beneﬁt that the algae receive from the formation of clouds.
E. They fail to recognize changes in surface water temperature that are caused by algae clouds.
6. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. explain the role played by temperature in the stimulation of DMS production by marine algae
B. outline the sequence of events that occurs during the process of cloud formation caused by
algal activity
C. describe a dispute about the role played by marine algae in certain instances of cloud formation
D. propose a way in which scientists might be able to understand the effects of clouds on marine
algae
E. discuss a theory regarding the function of DMS production by marine algae
136


 Passage 124
When Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago, the Sun burned only 70 percent as brightly as it does 
today. Yet Geologic record contains no evidence for widespread glaciation until 2.3 billion 
years ago. Sagan and Mullen suggested in the 1970s that ammonia, a greenhouse gas, 
warmed early Earth’s atmosphere, but subsequent research showed that the Sun’s ultraviolet 
rays rapidly destroy ammonia in an oxygen-free environment, such as that of early Earth. 
Many scientists now attribute much of the warming of early Earth to oxygen-intolerant 
microbes—methanogens—that produce the greenhouse gas methane. The methanogen 
hypothesis could help to explain the first global ice age: 2.3 billion years ago, Earth’s 
atmosphere began to fill with oxygen produced by other microbes—cyanobacteria—
causing methanogens to decline rapidly.
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It refutes the possibility of a connection between two events previously thought to be
related.
B. It describes how a hypothesis might account for the timing of a phenomenon described
earlier in the passage
C. It presents evidence that casts doubt on a statement made in the first sentence of the
passage
D. It clarifies a distinction between two related hypotheses
E. It introduces findings that challenge a dominant explanation for a particular phenomenon
2. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about methanogens?
A. Methanogens must have appeared on Earth later than 2.3 billion years ago.
B. Methanogens must have been much more prevalent in some regions of the early Earth than
in others.
C. Methanogens produce a greenhouse gas that is more susceptible to destruction by the
Sun’s ultraviolent rays than is ammonia.
D. Methanogens could not have thrived in early Earth’s atmosphere without the presence of
ammonia.
E. Methanogens would have had a less significant effect on early Earth’s atmosphere if they
had evolved after the appearance of cyanobacteria.
137


 Passage 125
Some researchers claim that cetaceans—whales and dolphins—have culture, which the 
researchers define as the ability to learn from one another. Skeptics, however, demand clear 
evidence that cetaceans can acquire new behaviors through some form of social learning, 
preferably clear-cut instances of imitation or teaching. But such evidence is difficult to obtain. 
While few people doubt that captive cetaceans are adept at imitation or that they reproduce 
behaviors taught by researchers, biologists seeking insight into cetaceans’ behavior in their 
natural habitats must rely on deduction rather than experiments. If members of a particular 
group share behaviors that do not result from genetic inheritance or environmental 
variation, then they have almost certainly learned them by watching, following, or 
listening to other animals.
1. Which of the following best describe the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It identifies a factor that complicates biologists’ ability to draw conclusions about the
behavior of cetaceans in their natural environments.
B. It illustrates the kind of deduction mentioned in the preceding sentence.
C. It explains why skeptics have remained unpersuaded by evidence that has been put
forward in support of the claim that cetaceans have culture.
D. It introduces a claim that would be dismissed by both supporters and opponents of the view
that cetaceans have culture.
E. It notes a previously overlooked factor that might shed light on the question of whether
cetaceans have culture.
2. The passage suggests which of the following about captive cetaceans?
A. Whether they are engaged in social learning is a subject of disagreement among biologists.
B. Their ability to imitate new behaviors is more extensive than that of noncaptive cetaceans.
C. They exhibit few behaviors that have not also been observed in cetaceans in their natural
habitats.
D. They appear to adopt new behaviors more quickly than noncaptive cetaceans.
E. They exhibit tendencies that suggest a capacity for the kind of behavior that qualifies as
cultural.
138


 Passage 126
Hotter and more massive than the Sun, stars called “stragglers” are puzzling to astronomers 
because such rapidly burning stars would not be expected to persist in ancient star clusters. 
Some researchers believe that the typical blue stragglers formed when two ancient, 
lower-mass stars collide and merge form more massive, hotter star. Peter Leonard 
theorizes alternatively that in low density globular clusters, where mergers between single 
stars occur too infrequently to account for the observed quantity of blue stragglers, these 
stragglers are created instead by a group of stars. He suggests that a pair of stars already 
orbiting each other presents a larger target for a third star or another pair. Once this new 
grouping forms, close encounters between the stars could prompt any two to merge as a blue 
straggler. Leonard’s model predicts that each blue straggler has a distant orbiting companion
—as appears true of many blue stragglers in the M67 cluster of the Milky Way galaxy.
1. The reference to a “larger target” serves primarily to suggest why a
A. blue straggler would be more likely to collide and merge with another star than would be a
lower-mass star.
B. pair of stars would be more likely to encounter other stars than would the typical blue
straggler.
C. pair of stars would be more likely to interact with other stars than would a single star.
D. blue straggler would be more likely to interact with a pair of stars than it would with a third
star.
E. third star would be more likely to encounter a pair than it would to encounter a blue
straggler.
2. Information presented in the passage suggests which of the following about blue stragglers?
A. They originate from stars that are hotter and more massive than the Sun.
B. They are burning more rapidly than other types of stars observed in ancient star clusters.
C. They are older than most other types of stars within the same star cluster.
D. They are less numerous in low-density globular clusters than are pairs of stars.
E. They generally originate from the oldest stars among those found in ancient star clusters.
3. The passage cites which of the following as evidence undermining the theory presented in
the second sentence?
A. a discrepancy between the number of mergers between single stars in certain low-density
globular clusters and that in other low-density globular clusters
B. a discrepancy between the heat and mass of blue stragglers formed by one type of process
and the heat and mass of blue stragglers formed by another type of process
C. a discrepancy between the frequency of star mergers in low-density globular clusters and
those in high-density globular clusters
D. a discrepancy between the amount of heat and mass of ancient single stars and that of blue
stragglers
E. a discrepancy between the number of mergers between single stars in certain star clusters
and the number of blue stragglers in those clusters
139


 Passage 127
Most seismologists assume that following a major earthquake and its aftershocks, the fault (a 
break in Earth’s crust where pressure can trigger an earthquake) will remain quiet until 
stresses have time to rebuild, typically over hundreds or thousands of years. Recent evidence 
of subtle interactions between earthquakes may overturn this assumption, however. According 
to the stress-triggering hypothesis, faults are unexpectedly responsive to subtle stresses they 
acquire as neighboring faults shift. Rather than simply dissipating, stress relieved during an 
earthquake travels along the fault, concentrating in sites nearby; even the smallest additional 
stresses may then trigger another quake along the fault or on a nearby fault. Although 
scientists have long viewed such subtle interactions as nonexistent, the hypothesis has 
explained the location and frequency of earthquakes following several destructive quakes in 
California, Japan, and Turkey.
1. According to the passage, which of the following is an assumption that may be invalidated
by recent seismological evidence?
A. Earthquakes are caused by stresses building up in faults within Earth’s crust.
B. Most major earthquakes can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.
C. Faults are highly responsive to even minor stresses in neighboring faults.
D. Most major earthquakes are followed by predictable aftershocks.
E. A fault that has resulted in a major earthquake becomes quiet for a long period.
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. The passage suggests that most seismologists believe which of the following about fault
stresses?
A. They are dissipated when they result in an earthquake.
B. They are transferred between neighboring faults.
C. They will not cause a major earthquake along the same fault in the space of a few years.

 Passage 128
MacArthur and Wilson suggested that the biodiversity of an island will vary in direct proportion 
to a function of the island’s size (i.e., larger islands can support a greater number of species) 
and in inverse proportion to a function of its distance from the mainland (i.e., many remote 
islands will tend to support fewer species). Reduced biodiversity in an island context is likely to 
require significant adaptation on the part of colonizing human populations. Evans argues that 
this limitation makes islands ideal laboratories for the study of human adaptations to the 
natural environment, whilst Renfrew and Wagstaff, in the introduction to their study of Melos, 
focus on this limitation in biodiversity as a “significant characteristic of the island ecosystem.” 
For human communities, however, this limitation may potentially be offset by other factors. The 
reduced biodiversity of an island ecosystem applies only to terrestrial resources: the resources 
of the sea will be as rich as on any other coastal area, and may be equally important to human 
communities. A small island such as Malta or Melos allows all communities direct access to 
the sea, providing an important nutritional “safety net,” as well as an element of dietary 
diversity, which may actually give island communities an advantage over their landlocked 
counterparts. Islands may also have specific nonbiological resources (such as obsidian on 
Melos), which may be used in exchange with communities on other islands and adjacent 
mainlands.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. evaluate two contrasting approaches to island biodiversity
B. discuss the relevance of certain data pertaining to island biodiversity
C. call into question a particular understanding of island biodiversity
D. consider various reasons for reduced biodiversity on islands
E. contrast large and small islands in terms of overall biodiversity
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. According to the author, factors of potential importance to human communities on islands
include
A. the accessibility of the sea’s resources
B. a diet superior in some respects to the diet of landlocked communities
C. nonbiological resources that can be exploited
3. The author suggests that in considering the biodiversity of islands, Evans
A. focuses too exclusively on terrestrial resources
B. misunderstands the relationship between an island’s size and its terrestrial resources
C. misinterprets the work of MacArthur and Wilson
D. is wrong to assume that more remote islands support fewer species
E. downplays the ways that human communities adapt to island biodiversity
141


 Passage 129
A critical consensus has emerged that Mary McCarthy will be remembered primarily as an 
essayist rather than as a novelist. But despite her formidable gifts as a polemical and 
discursive writer, and for all her reputation as an intellectual who sacrificed feeling to 
intelligence, what powers McCarthy’s best essays are her fictional rather than strictly 
intellectual gifts. She makes her points by telling stories or by way of vivid description, 
arresting images and subtle characterization. And for all her exacting sense of fact, 
McCarthy’s greatest contribution was to blur the distinctions between different kinds of prose 
writing: to show how fiction could be opened up to the thinking mind and how essays could 
profit from the techniques of fiction.
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. The author of the passage suggests that Mary McCarthy’s writing is characterized by
A. The use in her essays of devices more typical in works of fiction
B. A narrowing of the differences between narrative and expository prose
C. Careful attention to factual accuracy.
2. In the context in which it appears, “discursive” most nearly means
A. prolific
B. sophistic
C. rambling
D. analytical
E. circuitous
142


 Passage 130
Some archaeologists speculate that the Americas might have been initially colonized between 
40,000 and 25,000 years ago. However, to support this theory it is necessary to explain the 
absence of generally accepted habitation sites for that time interval in what is now the United 
States. Australia, which has a smaller land area than the United States, has many such sites, 
supporting the generally accepted claim that the continent was colonized by humans at least 
40,000 years ago. Australia is less densely populated (resulting in lower chances of 
discovering sites) and with its overall greater aridity would have presented conditions less 
favorable for hunter-gatherer occupation. Proportionally, at least as much land area has been 
lost from the coastal regions of Australia because of postglacial sea-level rise as in the United 
States, so any coastal archaeological record in Australia should have been depleted about as 
much as a coastal record in the United States. Since there are so many resource-rich rivers 
leading inland from the United States coastlines, it seems implausible that a growing 
population of humans would have confined itself to coasts for thousands of years. If 
inhabitants were present 25,000 years ago, the chances of their appearing in the 
archaeological record would seem to be greater than for Australia.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with doing which of the following?
A. presenting an objection to a claim
B. accounting for an apparent anomaly
C. outlining an alternative interpretation
D. correcting a particular misconception
E. questioning the validity of a comparison
2. The author of the passage implies which of the following about 25,000 years ago?
A. The coastline of the region that is now the United States is longer than it was 40,000 years
ago.
B. Rivers in what is now the United States were numerous than they are now.
C. Australia was less densely populated at that time than was the region that is now the United
States.
D. Australia’s climate was significantly drier than it is now.
E. Global sea level was lower than it is now.
3. The author of the passage implies that, in what is now the United States, archaeological
evidence of inhabitation in the period from 40,000 to 25,000 years ago is lacking because that
region
A. had its oldest habitation sites inundated following a postglacial rise in sea level.
B. has many resource-rich rivers that facilitated the dispersal of early inhabitants from an initial
concentration in coastal areas.
C. was sparsely populated until about 25,000 years ago.
D. was colonized less than 25,000 years ago.
E. was inhabited only by hunter-gatherers until 25,000 years ago.
143


 Passage 131
Animals live longer when their calorie intake is restricted to two-thirds of what is considered 
normal for their species. Animals so restricted are also generally healthier: most disease, 
including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative illness, are forestalled. This phenomenon 
was long attributed to a simple slowing of metabolism (cells’ production of energy from 
fuel molecules) and consequent reproduction of its toxic by-products in response to less food. 
In fact, however, calorie restriction does not slow mammalian metabolism, and in yeast and 
worms, metabolism is both sped up and altered. Some scientists now theorize that calorie 
restriction is a biological stressor that, like natural food scarcity, induces a more complex 
defensive response, which in mammals includes changes in cellular defenses and repair.
1. In the passage, the function of the highlighted portion (in yeast… and altered) is to
A. provide specific examples of organisms whose longevity does not increase in response to
calorie restriction.
B. illustrate the probable means by which organisms placed on a calorie-restriction diet
compensate for the reduction in available food-based level.
C. suggest the mechanism that is responsible for prolonging the life of organism whose calorie
intake is significantly reduced.
D. give an example that explain why scientists’ thinking about the physiological effects of
calorie restriction changed.
E. distinguish the different ways that mammalian and non-mammalian metabolisms respond to
significant reductions in calorie intake
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. The passage implies which of the following about the explanation mentioned in the
highlighted text (This phenomenon… of metabolism)?
A. There are empirical findings that conflict with a presumption of the explanation.
B. The explanation predicts that the effect of calorie restriction on longevity will be the greatest
for the species with the highest rate of metabolism.
C. The explanation predicts that the effects of calorie restriction will be uniformly positive.
144


 Passage 132
The “deindustrialization” thesis of Bluestone and Harrison asserts that the replacement of 
domestic with foreign manufacturing begun by United States corporations in the late 1960s 
resulted in a “hollowing out” of American industry, whereby workers displaced from 
manufacturing jobs through massive plant closings found themselves moving more or less 
permanently into lower-paying, less secure jobs or into unemployment. Critics of the 
deindustrialization thesis have argued that new service and high-technology sectors of the 
United States economy have recently created a substantial number of jobs. While these critics 
do not deny the painful aspects of this transition from an industrial to a service- and 
information-based economy, they argue that it will be short-term, and a necessary evil if the 
United States is to have long-term increases in living standards. Critics of the emerging 
economy, however, point to disturbing evidence of an “hourglass” effect: a shrinking middle 
tier of managerial and blue-collar unionized workers and consequent polarization of incomes. 
The emergence of a technical and financial elite, they argue, has brought forth a host of low-
wage jobs to service the new economy, and it is this service sector that many ex-industrial 
workers must seek.
1. The purpose of the passage is to
A. analyze the events that contributed to an economic phenomenon
B. present different views on the nature and impact of an economic phenomenon
C. distinguish between the short-term and long-term effects of an economic phenomenon
D. challenge a dominant theory about how to solve the problems created by an economic
phenomenon
E. present new evidence to suggest that an economic phenomenon is more complex than had
previously been believed
2. Which of the following, if true, would most tend to weaken the deindustrialization thesis of
Bluestone and Harrison?
A. a survey of the spouses of former industrial workers reveals a significant increase in the
number of working spouses since the mid-1960s.
B. data from the most recent United States census show that fewer individuals list their
occupation as industrial worker than in the census from ten years earlier.
C. a random survey of United States consumers indicates that a majority of those surveyed
would prefer to buy United States-manufacturing goods if given the opportunity.
D. A recent study indicates that large numbers of former industrial workers have retrained and
found employment as skilled, highly-paid computer workers.
E. Interviews with representatives at major agencies for temporary employment in the United
States suggest that they value the skills of former industrial workers.
3. It can be inferred from the passage that the highlighted “critics” believe which of the
following about “hourglass” effect?
A. It involves the relegation of industrial workers to less desirable jobs.
B. It requires that workers make short-term sacrifices to achieve long-term gains.
C. It affects non-unionized workers more strongly than it does unionized workers.
D. It represents an increase in unemployment for those in the service sector.
E. It threatens the status of the technological and financial elite.
145


 Passage 133
Some historians question the widely held belief that continually improving education led to 
gradual African American empowerment in the southern United States from the late nineteenth 
century through the mid-twentieth century. They note that the development of Black 
educational institutions in the segregated South was never rapid or steady: disparities 
between Black and White schools sometimes grew in the early decades of the twentieth 
century. And African Americans’ educational gains did not bring commensurate economic 
gains. Starting in the 1940s, even as Black and White schools in the South moved steadily 
toward equality, Black southerners remained politically marginalized and experienced 
systematic job discrimination. Although Black schools had achieved near parity with White 
schools in per capita spending and teachers’ salaries by 1965, African Americans’ income still 
lagged behind that of Whites. Nonetheless, educational progress did contribute toward 
economic and political empowerment. African Americans’ campaigns to support Black 
schools fostered a sense of community, nurtured political determination, and often increased 
literacy. More significantly, politically outspoken Black newspapers achieved record circulation 
during the 1940s, just as the literacy rate among African Americans approached 90 percent. 
Finally, the leadership of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s was composed largely of 
graduates of Black colleges.
1. The author of the passage refers to the fact that “disparities between Black and White
schools sometimes grew in the early decades of the twentieth century” most likely in order to
A. support the argument that the economic struggles of southern Blacks were largely due to
educational inequalities
B. give an example of the differences between Black schools in the early part of the twentieth
century and Black schools starting in the 1940s
C. illustrate the unevenness of the progress made by Black schools in the southern United
States
D. help explain why Black remained politically marginalized and experienced systematic job
discrimination in the segregated South
E. provide evidence that educational progress was a precondition for economic progress in the
segregated South
2. Which of the following best describes the purpose of the highlighted sentence?
A. It clarifies a point introduced in the preceding sentence.
B. It reiterates a point introduced in the first sentence of the passage.
C. It questions the accuracy of some of the evidence used to support the argument of the
historians.
D. It introduces a perspective that runs contrary to the view of those who endorse the “belief.”
E. It qualifies the interpretation made by the historians.
3. The passage suggests which of the following about the Civil Rights movement?
A. It gave rise to a rapid increase in the number of Black newspapers published in the South.
B. Its political effectiveness was greatly enhanced by the increased circulation of Black
newspapers.
C. Its leadership benefited from improvements in education for African Americans.
D. It was the force primarily responsible for increasing per capita spending in Black schools.
E. It was responsible for changing many historians’ view of the relation between education and
African American empowerment.
146


 Passage 134
An influential early view held that ecosystems contain niches for a limited number of species 
and that competition for resources among species—whether native or nonnative invading ones
—determines ecosystems’ species composition. However, factors other than competition often 
help explain invading species’ success. For example, the American grey squirrel, often cited 
as a classic example of competitively superior invading species, was introduced in England in 
1876 and now thrives, while the native red squirrel population has declined. Although 
scientists have found gray squirrels to be more efficient foragers than red ones, they also note 
that even before the gray squirrel’s arrival, Britain’s red squirrel populations had a periodic 
tendency to die out, only to be subsequently reintroduced. Furthermore, many gray squirrels 
are silent carriers of a disease fatal to red squirrels.
1. It can be inferred that the author of the passage mentions the efficiency with which gray
squirrels forage primarily in order to
A. identify a factor that explains a certain phenomenon
B. call attention to an inconsistency in a particular theory
C. suggest that competition cannot be the factor responsible for a particular outcome
D. acknowledge a fact that appears to support a view that the author intends to qualify
E. cite evidence that is not consistent with an early influential view about species competition
2. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of
the following statements about the “early view?”
A. It reflects a mistaken assumption about the means by which nonnative species are
introduced into ecosystems.
B. Its basic premise is shown to be valid by the effect of American gray squirrels on Britain’s
red squirrel population.
C. It presents a simplistic picture of the means by which species composition within
ecosystems is determined.
D. It can effectively explain the formation of ecosystems that contain few species but cannot
adequately account for the formation of complex ecosystems.
E. It understates the importance of competition as a factor determining species composition
within ecosystems.
147


 Passage 135
The revival of mural painting that has occurred in San Francisco since the 1970s, especially 
among the Chicano population of the city’s Mission District, has marked differences from its 
social realist forerunner in Mexico and the United States some 40 years earlier. Rather than 
being government sponsored and limited to murals on government buildings, the 
contemporary mural movement sprang from the people themselves, with murals appearing on 
community buildings and throughout college campuses. Perhaps the biggest difference, 
however, is the process. In earlier twentieth-century Mexico, murals resulted from the vision of 
individual artists. But today’s murals are characteristically the products of artists working with 
local residents on design and creation.
Such community engagement is characteristic of the Chicano art movement as a whole, which 
evolved from the same foundations as the Chicano civil rights movement of the mid-1960s. 
Both were a direct response to the needs of Chicanos in the United States, who were fighting 
for the right to adequate education, political empowerment, and decent working conditions. 
Artists joined other cultural workers in making political statements and played a key role in 
taking these statements to the public. They developed collectives and established cultural 
centers that functioned as the public-relations arm of the Chicano sociopolitical movement.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. argue for the superiority of a style of art
B. consider the impact of an art movement
C. describe the political content of a certain works of art
D. detail the characteristic style of an art movement
E. place an art movement in its historical context
2. According to the passage, which of the following statements about the “cultural centers” is
true?
A. They were the venue where many later leaders of the Chicano civil rights movement first
became politically active.
B. Though later widespread, they originated in San Francisco area.
C. Springing up in a number of communities, they initially had largely apolitical goals centered
on art instruction.
D. They constituted the nucleus from which the Chicano civil rights movement originated.
E. Founded by artists, they provided support for the Chicano civil rights movement.
3. Which of the following best describes the relationship between the first paragraph and the
second paragraph of the passage?
A. The first focuses on the mural artists as individuals; the second, on their actions as a group.
B. The first compares the mural revival with an earlier artistic movement; the second describes
the context contemporary to the revival
C. The first defines the revival by distinguishing it from an earlier artistic movement; the
second addresses the political goals of both the revival and its forerunner
D. The first presents an apparently plausible account of the relationship between the revival
and is forerunner, the second calls that account into question
E. The first is concerned with the artistic aims and ambitions behind the San Francisco murals;
the second considers their political significance

 Passage 136
Although Elizabeth Stuart Phelps’ novel Doctor Zay (1882) dominates critical discussion of 
Phelps’ interest in woman doctors, preceding it were many little-known writings by Phelps. 
These writings underscored the achievements of already established women doctors, the 
imperative of medically educating and training women in the face of pernicious resistance, and 
the medical woman’s symbolic value as an agent of healing in post-Civil War America. An 
exploration of this largely overlooked early prose demonstrates that Phelps played an 
instrumental role in legitimizing the American medical woman during a crucial earlier period 
when the number of women doctors in the United States increased substantially, but the 
woman doctor remained perhaps the most controversial new presence on the nation’s 
occupational landscape.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would be likely to agree with which of the
following statements about Phelps’ writing?

woman doctor, her novel Doctor Zay did not.
B. Critics have tended to underestimate the impact Phelps’ earlier work had in helping to
legitimize the figure of the American woman doctor during an important period.
C. The substantial increase in the number of woman doctors in post-Civil War America was a
more significant factor than was Phelps’ writing in helping to legitimize woman doctors in post-
Civil War America.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. The passage provides information on which of the following?
A. The public response to the emergence of women doctors during Phelps’ lifetime

 Passage 137
A bird’s plumage, while contributing to structural integrity and participating in aerial locomotion, 
completely obscures a bird’s internal activity from human view, greatly impeding our attempts 
to understand birds as functioning animals. Plumage has even made it difficult to describe bird 
movement. When describing the movement of mammals, writers turn to well-worn clichés like 
“grace in motion.” A mammal’s rippling muscles slide smoothly over one another in eye-
catching ways. With a mammal, whether a mouse or hippopotamus, we recognize that the 
underlying body parts are similar to our own and we know these parts will act predictably. Not 
so with a bird. For centuries, we knew little more about a bird’s movement than that it was a 
mystery that seemed to be based on the flapping of wings.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. The passage mentions which of the following as an effect of bird plumage?
A. It contributes to a bird’s ability to fly.
B. It hides the inner workings of birds.
C. It contributes to the structural soundness of birds.
2. The author implies which of the following about the “underlying body parts” of nonhuman
mammals?
A. They are more similar to humans’ underlying body parts than most people assume.
B. They are more predictable in their workings than are the underlying body parts of humans.
C. Their smooth and grateful actions belie how complicated they actually are.
D. They work in much different ways than do the underlying body parts of most birds.
E. They are easier to observe and understand than are underlying parts of birds.

 Passage 138
In the 1920s, Gerstmann described a set of problems found in people who have suffered 
damage to the brain’s left parietal lobe, problems that include being unable to understand 
arithmetic and having difficulty identifying one’s fingers. There is still no agreement on whether 
the symptoms Gerstmann noticed constitute a syndrome, but the parts of the brain used for 
storing facts about numbers and for representing the fingers are close to each other. 
Mental representations of numbers and of fingers may therefore be functionally connected. A 
2005 experiment had people perform some tasks requiring dexterity and others involving 
matching pairs of numbers, while an area of their parietal lobes—the left angular gyrus—was 
stimulated by a magnetic field. Facility at both sets of tasks was impaired.
1. The author of the passage would most likely agree that the highlighted statement suggests
A. a flaw in the experiment conducted in 2005
B. a means by which dexterity might compensate for a loss of arithmetic ability
C. an explanation for some of Gerstmann’s observations
D. an anomaly in some of Gerstmann’s results
E. a reason to doubt damage to the left parietal lobe as a causal factor in certain symptoms
2. The author of the passage describes the “2005 experiment” and its results primarily in order
to
A. establish the proximity between the part of the brain used for storing numerical information
and the part used for representing the fingers
B. illustrate the implications that Gerstmann’s work may have for experimental research
C. cast doubt on the idea that damage to the left parietal lobe causes the set of problems that
Gerstmann described
D. support a hypothesis about a significant association between parts of the brain related to
fingers and to numbers
E. suggest that the problems Gerstmann noted in relation to numbers and fingers have a
different cause than the other problems associated with parietal lobe damage
151


 Passage 139
Analyzing levels of proportional representation of American Indians in state and local 
government jobs is important for several reasons. First, the basic idea underlying the theory of 
representative bureaucracy is that the demographic composition of bureaucracy should mirror 
the demographic composition of the general public. This is because in addition to its symbolic 
value, increased access to managerial position may lead to greater responsiveness on the 
part of policy makers to the policy interests of traditionally disadvantaged groups such as 
American Indians. Second, the focus on higher level jobs in bureaucracies (as opposed to 
non-managerial positions) is especially important because managerial positions represent a 
major source of economic progress for members of traditionally disadvantaged groups, as 
these jobs confer good salaries, benefits, status, security, and mobility. Third, it is important to 
know if there has been growth in the American Indian share of more desirable public sector 
positions over the last two decades. For instance, Peterson and Duncan argue that the 
population and power of American Indians have been growing in certain states. Peterson and 
Duncan also suggest that this growth may reflect the possibility that American Indian 
population are becoming more active in nontraditional areas of politics, assimilating 
into mainstream culture, and securing with greater frequency leadership positions in 
non-tribal government.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. summarize a demographic trend over time
B. present findings on a demographic group
C. analyze the demographic composition of a type of job
D. explain the need for particular social research
E. argue for the implementation of a social policy
2. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context
of the passage as whole?
A. It hypothesizes a phenomenon that might explain a point made in the preceding sentence.
B. It provides evidence that undermines that assertion made in the first sentence.
C. It offers a projection regarding the development of a trend mentioned earlier in the passage.
D. It presents an interpretation of a discrepancy noted earlier in the passage.
E. It proposed an implementation of a policy mentioned in the preceding sentence.
3. The passage suggests which of the following regarding “access to managerial positions” for
disadvantaged groups?
A. This access is only significant when the percentage of disadvantaged group members in
managerial positions mirrors the percent of that group in the general public.
B. This access is largely the result of policy decisions made response to interest of those
groups.
C. This access has meaning apart from any policy benefits it confer on those groups.
D. This access often creates increased access to non-managerial position for those groups.
E. The extent of this access tends to be similar across different disadvantaged groups.

 Passage 140
Some attine ants carry vegetation into their nests and add fungal material, thereby creating 
“gardens” in which fungal food for the ants grow. Because the ants play the behaviorally active 
role, it seems compelling to say that they cultivate and control the passive fungi. But even if 
that is true, the symbiotic association has existed for so long that cultivar traits may have 
evolved in the fungi that benefit the fungi but not necessarily the ants. Furthermore, many 
microorganisms have developed sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate the physiology and 
behavior of their symbiotic animals. It is not implausible, therefore, that the ants’ fungi have 
evolved chemical and physiological schemes that alter ant behavior to serve the fungus’ 
reproductive interests, possibly even compromising the reproductive interests for the ant 
hosts.
1. The passage points out which of the following in order to explain the appeal of the notion
that some attine ants cultivate and control fungus?
A. The ants play the behaviorally active roles in the symbiotic relationship.
B. The ants purposefully carry vegetation into their nests for their own consumption.
C. Fungus is physiologically a passive substance.
D. Other organisms are able to manipulate their symbiotic partners.
E. The chemical and physiological properties of the fungus are subject to ant influence.
2. In the context in which it appears, the word “manipulate” most nearly means
A. influence
B. oversee
C. coerce
D. deceive
E. outmaneuver
153


 Passage 141
As of late 1980s, neither theorists nor large-scale computer climate models could accurately 
predict whether cloud systems would help or hurt a warming globe. Some studies suggested 
that a four percent increase in stratocumulus clouds over the ocean could compensate for a 
doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide, preventing a potentially disastrous planet-wide 
temperature increase. On the other hand, an increase in cirrus clouds could increase global 
warming. 
That clouds represented the weakest element in climate models was illustrated by a study of 
fourteen such models. Comparing climate forecasts for a world with double the current amount 
of carbon dioxide, researchers found that the models agreed quite well if clouds were not 
included. But when clouds were incorporated, a wide range of forecasts was produced. With 
such discrepancies plaguing the models, scientists could not easily predict how quickly the 
world’s climate would change, nor could they tell which regions would face dustier droughts or 
deadlier monsoons. 
1. The author of the passage is primarily concerned with
A. confirming a theory
B. supporting a statement
C. presenting new information
D. predicting future discoveries
E. comparing points of view
2. It can be inferred that one reason the fourteen models described in the passage failed to
agree was that
A. they failed to incorporate the most up-to-date information about the effect of clouds on
climate
B. they were based on faulty information about factors other than clouds that affect climate
C. they were based on different assumptions about the overall effects of clouds on climate
D. their originators disagreed about the kinds of forecasts the models should provide
E. their originators disagreed about the factors other than clouds that should be included in the
models
3. The information in the passage suggests that scientists would have to answer which of the
following questions in order to predict the effect of clouds on the warming of the globe?
A. What kinds of cloud systems will form over the Earth?
B. How can cloud systems be encouraged to form over the ocean?
C. What are the causes of the projected planetwide temperature increase?
D. What proportion of cloud systems are currently composed of cirrus clouds?
154


 Passage 142
Many theorists now doubt that heat loss from Earth’s core and radioactive decay are sufficient 
by themselves to produce all the energy driving the tectonic plates whose movements have 
helped shaped Earth’s surface. This leaves a loose end in current geological theory. Herbert 
Shaw argues that because scientists have underestimated the input of substantial amounts of 
energy from extraterrestrial impactors (asteroids and comets striking Earth), they have 
difficulty accounting for the difference between the quantity of energy produced from sources 
intrinsic to Earth and that involved in plate tectonics. Whereas most geologists have treated 
the addition of energy through the bombardment of Earth’s surface by such impactors as a 
process separate and independent from the movement of Earth’s tectonic plates, Shaw 
asserts that these processes are indivisible. Shaw’s revolutionary “open-system” view 
recognizes a continuum between terrestrial and extraterrestrial dynamics, whereas modern 
plate tectonic theory, like the classical geology developed during the nineteenth century, is 
founded on the view that Earth’s geological features have changed through gradual, regular 
processes intrinsic to Earth, without reference to unique catastrophic events. Classical 
geology borrowed a decisive, if unspoken, premise from Newton—the independence of Earth’s 
processes from any astronomical context. 
1. The author’s primary purpose is to
A. identify the influences informing a particular geological theory about the processes that
have shaped Earth’s surface
B. identify differences between two views of the extraterrestrial impactors and argue that the
phenomenon has influenced the development of plate tectonic theory
C. argue that an explanation is based on a dubious evidence and propose an alternative
explanation
D. discuss an explanation and place that explanation under theoretical context
E. suggest that apparent discrepancy poses a serious problem for a particular theory that
many have believed
2. The author of the passage mentions the “continuum” in order to
A. point out a relationship between plate tectonics and the nineteenth-century geology
B. explain how a theory of Newton’s could influence geology and plate tectonic theory.
C. distinguish between two sources of energy that contributed to the development of Earth’s
surface.
D. point out a similarity between the surface of impactors and the surface of Earth.
E. identify a feature of Shaw’s view that deviates from current scientific theories.
3. The passage suggests which of the following about tectonic theory?
A. It has led scientists to overlook an important contribution to classical geologists from
Newton.
B. It has been more successful than was classical geology in accounting for heat loss from
Earth’s core.
C. It is based on premise about Earth’s processes discerned in Newton’s thought.
D. It has correctly explained the effects of extraterrestrial impactors on Earth’s surface.
E. It corrects a fundamental flaw in classical geology.
155


 Passage 143
Human impacts on the natural environment during the later part of the Holocene (beginning 
about 4,000 years ago) complicate investigations into environmental change during that period 
because the signals produced by human-and climate-induced change are sometimes difficult 
to separate. For example, in the later Holocene, one indicator of increased aridity due to 
climate change is an increase in pollen from grasses, as forest vegetation gives way to 
grassland. Such a change in vegetation could alternatively be attributed to human impact in 
the form of agricultural development. Examples of such human impact from 4,000 years 
ago would be small-scale, however, since the broad ecosystem changes brought about 
by the widespread adoption of agricultural technologies occurred later.
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context
of the passage as a whole?
A. It provides an example of the kind of problems that often complicate investigations into
environmental change.
B. It call into question the reliability of the established dates for later Holocene agricultural
development.
C. It describes the nature of localized agricultural developments during the later Holocene.
D. It outlines a hypothesis that draws on evidence discussed earlier in the passage.
E. It limits the scope of a particular complication mentioned earlier in the passage.
2. According to the passage, which of the following is true regarding environmental changes
4,000 years ago?
A. No localized increases in grass pollen were caused by agricultural development.
B. Increases in grass pollen were at least sometimes a reflection of an increase in aridity.
C. Wholesale ecosystem changes probably resulted from agricultural development.
D. Any small-scale changes occurring then would not be detectable now.
E. Environmental change helped induce the adoption of agricultural technologies.
156


 Passage 144
Meggers argued that agriculture depends on extracting nutrients from soils into edible crops, 
so premodern societies in Amazonia could never grow large because underlying soils are 
impoverished. In Meggers’ view the population size that a culture could reach depended 
upon the agricultural potential of its environment. Meggers accepted that fish and turtle 
resources of the Amazon made possible the long riverside villages the explorer Orellana 
described in 1542, but she dismissed as exaggerated Carvajal’s estimates of tens of 
thousands of people in those settlements, and she was sure those settlements did not have 
inland counterparts. Supporting this point, the Omagua, a riverbank people and one of the 
greatest chiefdoms observed by Carvajal as a member of Orellana’s expedition, regarded 
hinterland forests as unpopulated wilderness.
1. In the context of the passage the highlighted sentence serves to
A. explain the broader rationale for a conclusion described in the preceding sentence
B. suggest some of the drawbacks of the riverbank location of the villages described in the
following sentence
C. acknowledge information that appears to undermine a description attributed to Orellana
D. introduce a principle that appears to be contradicted by the agricultural development of
premodern Amazonia
E. give a reason for an upward revision in earlier estimates for premodern Amazonia
2. From the passage it can be inferred that Omagua depended on
A. overland transport to communicate between villages
B. foraging inland to obtain foodstuffs not available locally
C. some form of fertilization to boost agricultural production
D. fish and turtles for at least part of their diet
E. trade with other peoples for some raw materials
157


 Passage 145
When selecting a nest, the female of the river blenny (a small fish) appears to be sensitive to 
both size and orientation. Blennies deposit their eggs preferably in nests under large stones 
and in nests facing southeast. Southeast-facing nests contain larger egg clutches, a fact that 
cannot be completely explained by differences in nest stone sizes. Moreover, in a recent study, 
current speeds upstream of the nest and at the nest entrance were similar for nests facing 
southeast and those facing in other directions. A southeast-facing entrance per se thus seems 
to be the specific nest feature preferred by females, rather than the effect of selective 
positioning on current at nest entrance. The reasons for this preference are unclear, however.
1. The passage is concerned with which of the following
A. determining the different ways in which current speeds can influence the nesting
preferences of female river blennies
B. establishing nest orientation as a determining factor in egg laying among female river
blennies
C. questioning the importance of nest size as an influence on egg laying among female river
blennies
D. comparing the features of female river blennies that face southeast with those of nests
facing in other directions
E. examining how female river blennies determine the relative importance of nest size versus
nest orientation
2. The author of the passage considers “current speeds” in order to
A. identify a factor that undermines the significance of nest stone size for female river blennies
B. indicate one possible advantage of river blenny nests that do not face southeast
C. eliminate a possible explanation for a nest orientation tendency among female river
blennies
D. indicate why female river blennies are sensitive to both size and orientation of possible
nests
E. suggest a reason why many female blennies prefer southeast-facing nests
158


 Passage 146
The editors of the essay collection Romantic biography tell us repeatedly that biography is an 
invention of the Romantic period in British literature (late eighteenth and early nineteenth 
centuries), yet we are never shown that process of invention motion. Hazlitt, the most 
prominent example of the Romantic biographer, is almost invisible. The Romantic period was 
not just the period in which biography was invented—or, rather, the period in which some of its 
informing principles were invented, since biography could just as easily be said to have 
originated in the scandalous memoirs that formed part of the pre-Romantic culture of the 
novel. It was also the period in which biography, through its sheer ubiquity, became an object 
of major ideological significance within British culture.
1. The passage mentions the "scandalous memoirs ” that were written prior to the Romantic
period primarily in order to
A. indicate an alternative account of the origins of biography
B. compare these memoirs to Romantic biography
C. explain how biography became ubiquitous in British culture
D question the ideological significance accorded to biography
E. suggest that biographies were not as popular as memoirs
2. According to the passage, biography attained great significance within British culture during
the Romantic period because biographies
A. were associated with scandal
B. were easy to read and comprehend
C. were so widespread in Britain at the time
D. challenged conventional British ideologies
E. contributed to the development of the novel
159


 Passage 147
Our study revealed that nest-guarding long-tailed skinks (a species of lizard) homed (returned 
to their nests) more successfully when displaced shorter distances. There are two reasons 
why homing success rates decreased with increasing displacement distance. One possibility is 
that females were simply displaced too far to find their way home. However, this is unlikely 
given that some individuals managed to find their way home from each distance we 
used. The second possibility deals with trade-offs between the risks associated with making a 
long return trip and the benefits of returning. Animals should expend energy only when the 
associated costs are low. As reptiles increase the time spent moving, their daily energy 
expenditure increases dramatically. The energetic costs of returning home and the chances 
that the eggs will have been preyed upon during the return trip both increase substantially as 
displacement distance increases. For example, the 130 hours (5.5 days) that female skinks 
spent returning from a distance of 300 meters is sufficient for an egg-eating snake to locate 
and prey upon the entire clutch. However, females with larger clutches were more likely to 
home at distances over 50 meters. For these females, the relative fitness benefits associated 
with having more eggs successfully hatch may outweigh the energetic costs of returning to a 
nest site, even if the nest may have already been preyed upon.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. question the validity of research on nest-guarding behavior in long-tailed skinks
B. consider explanations for a finding regarding long-tailed skinks
C. discuss the importance of homing for long-tailed skinks
D. describe the relationship between clutch size and homing success in long-tailed skinks
E. identify the benefits of a behavior common among long-tailed skinks
2. The claim in the highlighted sentence assumes which of the following about the individuals
that managed to find their way home from each distance?
A. They were less able to detect egg-eating predators than were the other long-tailed skinks
studied.
B. They were more averse to risk than were the other long-tailed skinks studied
C. They expended less energy when homing than did the other long-tailed skinks studied.
D. They did not possess better homing skills than did the other long-tailed skinks studied.
E. They had significantly smaller clutches than did the other long-tailed skinks studied.
3. The "second possibility" implies which of the following as a possible explanation for the
female long-tailed skinks that failed to home from distances over 50 meters ?
A. They had relatively small clutches.
B. They were unable to find their way home.
C. They lacked sufficient energy to home successfully.
D. They had male long-tailed skinks guarding their clutches.
E. They detected evidence of egg-eating snakes In the vicinity of their nests.

 Passage 148
Mary Barton, particularly in its early chapters, is a moving response to the suffering of the 
industrial worker in the England of the 1840s. What is most impressive about the book is the 
intense and painstaking effort made by the author, Elizabeth Gaskell, to convey the experience 
of everyday life in working class homes. Her method is partly documentary in nature: the novel 
includes such features as a carefully annotate reproduction of dialect, the exact details of food 
prices in an account of a tea party, an itemized description of the furniture of the Bartons’ living 
room, and a transcription (again annotated) of the ballad “The Oldham Weaver”. The interest 
of this record is considerable, even though the method has a slightly distancing effect.
As a member of the middle class, Gaskell could hardly help approaching working-class life as 
an outside observer and a reporter, and the reader of the novel is always conscious of this 
fact. But there is genuine imaginative re-creation in her accounts of the walk in Green Heys 
Fields, of tea at the Bartons’ house, and of John Barton and his friend’s discovery of the 
starving family in the cellar in the chapter “Poverty and Death.” Indeed, for a similarly 
convincing re-creation of such families’ emotions and responses (which are more crucial than 
the material details on which the mere reporter is apt to concentrate), the English novel had to 
wait 60 years for the early writing of D. H. Lawrence. If Gaskell never quite conveys the sense 
of full participation that would completely authenticate this aspect of Mary Bartons, she still 
brings to these scenes an intuitive recognition of feelings that has its own sufficient conviction.
The chapter “Old Aice’s History” brilliantly dramatizes the situation of that early generation of 
workers brought from the villages and the countryside to the urban industrial centers. The 
account of Job Leigh, the weaver and naturalist who is devoted to the study of biology, vividly 
embodies one kind of response to an urban industrial environment: an affinity for living things 
that hardens, by its very contrast with its environment, into a kind of crankiness. The early 
chapters—about factory workers walking out in spring into Green Heys Fields, about Alice 
Wilson, remembering in her cellar the twig-gathering for brooms in the native village that she 
will never again see, about job Leigh, intent on his impaled insects—capture the characteristic 
responses of a generation to the new and crushing experience of industrialism. The other 
early chapters eloquently portray the development of the instinctive cooperation with each 
other that was already becoming an important tradition among workers.
1. It can be inferred from examples given in the last paragraph of the passage that which of
the following was part of “the new and crushing experience of industrialism” for many
members of the English working class in the nineteenth century.
A. extortionate food prices
B. geographical displacement
C. hazardous working conditions
D. alienation from fellow workers
E. dissolution of family ties
2. It can be inferred that the author of the passage believes that Mary Barton might have been
an even better novel if Gaskell
A. concentrated on the emotions of a single character
B. made no attempt to re-create experiences of which she had no firsthand knowledge
C. made no attempt to reproduce working-class dialects
D. grown up in an industrial city
E. managed to transcend her position as an outsider
161


3. Which of the following best describes the author’s attitude toward Gaskell’s use of the
method of documentary record in Mary Barton?
A. uncritical enthusiasm
B. unresolved ambivalence
C. qualified approval
D. resigned acceptance
E. mild irritation
4. Which of the following is most closely analogous to Job Leigh in Mary Barton, as that
character is described in the passage?
A. an entomologist who collected butterflies as a child
B. a small-town attorney whose hobby is nature photography
C. a young man who leaves his family’s dairy farm to start his own business
D. a city dweller who raises exotic plants on the roof of his apartment building
E. a union organizer who works in a textile mill under dangerous conditions
162


 Passage 149
Although, recent years have seen substantial reductions in noxious pollutants from individual 
motor vehicles, the number of such vehicles has been steadily increasing, consequently, more 
than 100 cities in the United States still have levels of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, 
and ozone (generated by photochemical reactions with hydrocarbons from vehicle exhaust) 
that exceed legally established limits. There is a growing realization that the only effective way 
to achieve further reductions in vehicle emissions—short of a massive shift away from the 
private automobile—is to replace conventional diesel fuel and gasoline with cleaner-burning 
fuels such as compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol, or methanol.
All of these alternatives are carbon-based fuels whose molecules are smaller and simpler than 
those of gasoline. These molecules burn more cleanly than gasoline, in part because they 
have fewer, if any, carbon-carbon bonds, and the hydrocarbons they do emit are less likely to 
generate ozone. The combustion of larger molecules, which have multiple carbon-carbon 
bonds, involves a more complex series of reactions. These reactions increase the probability 
of incomplete combustion and are more likely to release uncombusted and photochemically 
active hydrocarbon compounds into the atmosphere. On the other hand, alternative fuels do 
have drawbacks. Compressed natural gas would require that vehicles have a set of heavy fuel 
tanks—a serious liability in terms of performance and fuel efficiency—and liquefied petroleum 
gas faces fundamental limits on supply.
Ethanol and methanol, on the other hand, have important advantages over other carbon-based 
alternative fuels: they have a higher energy content per volume and would require minimal 
changes in the existing network for distributing motor fuel. Ethanol is commonly used as a 
gasoline supplement, but it is currently about twice as expensive as methanol, the low cost of 
which is one of its attractive features. Methanol’s most attractive feature, however, is that it 
can reduce by about 90 percent the vehicle emissions that form ozone, the most serious urban 
air pollutant.
Like any alternative fuel, methanol has its critics. Yet much of the criticism is based on the use 
of “gasoline clone” vehicles that do not incorporate even the simplest design improvements 
that are made possible with the use of methanol. It is true, for example, that a given volume of 
methanol provides only about one-half of the energy that gasoline and diesel fuel do; other 
things being equal, the fuel tank would have to be somewhat larger and heavier. However, 
since methanol-fueled vehicles could be designed to be much more efficient than “gasoline 
clone” vehicles fueled with methanol, they would need comparatively less fuel. Vehicles 
incorporating only the simplest of the engine improvements that methanol makes feasible 
would still contribute to an immediate lessening of urban air pollution.
1. According to the passage, incomplete combustion is more likely to occur with gasoline than
with an alternative fuel because
A. the combustion of gasoline releases photochemically active hydrocarbons
B. the combustion of gasoline involves an intricate series of reactions
C. gasoline molecules have a simple molecular structure
D. gasoline is composed of small molecules.
E. gasoline is a carbon-based fuel
163


2. Which of the following most closely parallels the situation described in the first sentence of 
the passage?
A. Although a town reduces its public services in order to avoid a tax increase, the town’s tax
rate exceeds that of other towns in the surrounding area.
B. Although a state passes strict laws to limit the type of toxic material that can be disposed of
in public landfills, illegal dumping continues to increase.
C. Although a town’s citizens reduce their individual use of water, the town’s water supplies
continue to dwindle because of a steady increase in the total population of the town.
D. Although a country attempts to increase the sale of domestic goods by adding a tax to the
price of imported goods, the sale of imported goods within the country continues to increase.
E. Although a country reduces the speed limit on its national highways, the number of fatalities
caused by automobile accidents continues to increase.
3. It can be inferred from the passage that a vehicle specifically designed to use methanol for
fuel would
A. be somewhat lighter in total body weight than a conventional vehicle fueled with gasoline
B. be more expensive to operate than a conventional vehicle fueled with gasoline
C. have a larger and more powerful engine than a conventional vehicle fueled with gasoline
D. have a larger and heavier fuel tank than a “gasoline clone” vehicle fueled with methanol
E. average more miles per gallon than a “gasoline clone” vehicle fueled with methanol
4. The passage suggests which of the following about air pollution?
A. Further attempts to reduce emissions from gasoline-fueled vehicles will not help lower
urban air-pollution levels.
B. Attempts to reduce the pollutants that an individual gasoline-fueled vehicle emits have been
largely unsuccessful.
C. Few serious attempts have been made to reduce the amount of pollutants emitted by
gasoline-fueled vehicles.
D. Pollutants emitted by gasoline-fueled vehicles are not the most critical source of urban air
pollution.
E. Reductions in pollutants emitted by individual vehicles have been offset by increases in
pollution from sources other than gasoline-fueled vehicles.

 Passage 150
Despite winning several prestigious literary awards of the day, when it first appeared, Alice 
Walker’s The Color Purple generated critical unease over puzzling aspects of its compositions. 
In what, as one reviewer put it, was “clearly intended to be a realistic novel,” many reviewers 
perceived violations of the conventions of the realistic novel form, pointing out variously that 
late in the book, the narrator protagonist Celie and her friends are propelled toward a happy 
ending with more velocity than credibility, that the letters from Nettie to her sister Celie intrude 
into the middle of the main action with little motivation or warrant, and that the device of 
Celie’s letters to God is especially unrealistic in as much as it forgoes the concretizing details 
that traditionally have given the epistolary novel (that is, a novel composed of letters) its 
peculiar verisimilitude: the ruses to enable mailing letters, the cache, and especially the letters 
received in return.
Indeed, the violations of realistic convention are so flagrant that they might well call into 
question whether The Color of Purple is indeed intended to be a realistic novel, especially 
since there are indications that at least some of those aspects of the novel regarded by 
viewers as puzzling may constitutes its links to modes of writing other than Anglo-European 
nineteenth-century realism. For example, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has recently located the 
letters to God within an African American tradition deriving from slave narrative, a tradition in 
which the act of writing is linked to a powerful deity who “speaks” through scripture and 
bestows literacy as an act of grace. For Gates, the concern with finding a voice, which he sees 
as the defining feature of African American literature, links Celie’s letters with certain narrative 
aspects of Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, the 
acknowledged predecessor of The Color Purple.
Gates’s paradigm suggests how misleading it may be to assume that mainstream realist 
criteria are appropriate for evaluating The Color Purple. But in his preoccupation with voice as 
a primary element unifying both the speaking subject and the text as a whole Gates does not 
elucidate many of the more conventional structural features of Walker’s novel. For instance, 
while the letters from Nettie clearly illustrate Nettie’s acquisition of her own voice, Gates’s 
focus on “voice” sheds little light on the place that these letters occupy in the narrative or on 
why the plot takes this sudden jump into geographically and culturally removed surroundings. 
What is needed is an evaluative paradigm that, rather than obscuring such startling structural 
features (which may actually be explicitly intended to undermine traditional Anglo-European 
novelistic conventions), confronts them, thus illuminating the deliberately provocative ways in 
which The Color Purple departs from the traditional models to which it has been compared.
1. The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of the following
statements about the letters from Nettie to Celie?
A. They mark an unintended shift to geographically and culturally removed surroundings
B. They may represent a conscious attempt to undermine certain novelistic conventions
C. They are more closely connected to the main action of the novel than is at first apparent
D. They owe more to the tradition of the slave narrative than do Celie’s letters to God
E. They illustrate the traditional concretizing details of the epistolary novel form
165


2. In the second paragraph, the author of the passage is primarily concerned with
A. examining the ways in which The Color Purple echoes its acknowledged predecessor, Their
Eyes Were Watching God
B. providing an example of a critic who has adequately addressed the structural features of
The Color Purple
C. suggesting that literary models other than the nineteenth-century realistic novel may inform
our understanding of The Color Purple
D. demonstrating the ineffectiveness of a particularly scholarly attempt to suggest an
alternative way of evaluating The Color Purple
E. disputing the perceived notion that The Color Purple departs from conventions of the
realistic novel form
3. According to the passage, an evaluative paradigm that confronts the startling structural
features of The Color Purple would accomplish which of the following?
A. It would adequately explain why many reviewers of this novel have discerned its
connections to the realistic novel tradition
B. It would show the ways in which this novel differs from its reputed Anglo-European
nineteenth-century models
C. It would explicate the overarching role of voice in this novel
D. It would address the ways in which this novel echoes the central themes of Hurston’s Their
Eyes Are Watching God
E. It would reveals ways in which these structural features serve to parody novelistic
conventions
4. The author of the passage suggests that Gates is most like the reviewers mentioned in the
first paragraph in which of the following ways?
A. He points out discrepancies between The Color Purple and other traditional epistolary
novels
B. He sees the concern with finding a voice as central to both The Color Purple and Their
Eyes Are Watching God
C. He assumes that The Color Purple is intended to be a novel primarily in the tradition of
Anglo-American nineteenth-century realism
D. He does not address many of the unsettling structural features of The Color Purple
E. He recognizes the departure of The Color Purple from traditional Anglo-European realistic
novel conventions.

 Passage 151
“Blues is for singing,” writes folk musicologist Paul Oliver, and “is not a form of folk 
song that stands up particularly well when written down.” A poet who wants to write blues 
can attempt to avoid this problem by poeticizing the form—but literary blues tend to read like 
bad poetry rather than like refined folk song. For Oliver, the true spirit of the blues inevitably 
eludes the self-conscious imitator. However, Langston Hughes, the first writer to grapple with 
these difficulties of blue poetry, in fact succeeded in producing poems that capture the quality 
of genuine, performed blues while remaining effective as poems. In inventing blues poetry, 
Hughes solved two problems: first, how to write blues lyrics in such a way that they work on 
the printed page, and second, how to exploit the blues form poetically without losing all sense 
of authenticity.
There are many styles of blues, but the distinction of importance to Hughes is between the 
genres referred to as “folk blues” and “classic blues.” Folk blues and classic blues are 
distinguished from one another by differences in performers (local talents versus touring 
professionals), patronage (local community versus mass audience), creation (improvised 
versus composed), and transmission (oral versus written). It has been a commonplace among 
critics that Hughes adopted the classic blues as the primary model for his blues poetry, and 
that he writes his best blues poetry when he tries least to imitate the folk blues. In this view, 
Hughes’ attempts to imitate the folk blues are too self-conscious, too determined to 
romanticize the African American experience, too intent on reproducing what he takes to be 
the quaint humor and naïve simplicity of the folk blues to be successful.
But a more realistic view is that by conveying his perceptions as a folk artist ought to—through 
an accumulation of details over the span of his blues oeuvre, rather than by overloading each 
poem with quaintness and naivety–Hughes made his most important contributions to the 
genre. His blues poems are in fact closer stylistically to the folk blues on which he modeled 
them than to the cultivated classic blues. Arnold Rampersad has observed that virtually all of 
the poems in the 1927 collection in which Hughes essentially originated blues poetry fall 
deliberatively within the “range of utterance” of common folk. This surely applies to “Young 
Gal’s Blues,” in which Hughes avoids the conventionally “poetic” language and images that the 
subjects of death and love sometimes elicit in his ordinary lyric poetry. To see what Hughes’ 
blues poetry might have been like if he had truly adopted the classic blues as his model, one 
need only look to “Golden Brown Blues,” a song lyric Hughes wrote for composer W.C. Handy. 
Its images, allusions, and diction are conspicuously remote from the common “range of 
utterance.”
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. describe the influence of folk and classic blues on blues poetry
B. analyze the effect of African American culture on blues poetry
C. demonstrate that the language used in Hughes’ blues poetry is colloquial
D. defend Hughes’ blues poetry against criticism that it is derivative
E. refute an accepted view of Hughes’ blues poetry style
2. The author of the passage uses the highlighted quotation primarily to
A. indicate how blues poetry should be performed
B. highlight the difficulties faced by writers of blues poetry
C. support the idea that blues poetry is a genre doomed to fail
D. illustrate the obstacles that blues poetry is unable to overcome
E. suggest that written forms of blues are less authentic than sung blues
167


3. It can be inferred from the passage that, as compared with the language of “Golden Brown 
Blues,” the language of “Young Gal’s Blues” is
A. more colloquial
B. more melodious
C. marked by more allusions
D. characterized by more conventional imagery
E. more typical of classic blues song lyrics
4. According to the passage, Hughes’ blues poetry and classic blues are similar in which of the
following ways?
A. Both are improvised
B. Both are written down
C. Both are intended for the same audience
D. Neither uses colloquial language
E. Neither is professionally performed
168


 Passage 152
In February 1848 the people of Paris rose in revolt against the constitutional monarchy of 
Louis-Philippe. Despite the existence of excellent narrative accounts, the February Days, as 
this revolt is called, have been largely ignored by social historians of the past two decades. 
For each of the three other major insurrections in nineteenth-century Paris—July 1830, June 
1848, and May 1871—there exists at least a sketch of participants’ backgrounds and an 
analysis, more or less rigorous, of the reasons for the occurrence of the uprisings. Only in the 
case of the February Revolution do we lack a useful description of participants that might 
characterize it in the light of what social history has taught us about the process of 
revolutionary mobilization.
Two reasons for this relative neglect seem obvious. First, the insurrection of February has 
been overshadowed by that of June. The February Revolution overthrew a regime, to be sure, 
but met with so little resistance that it failed to generate any real sense of historical drama. Its 
successor, on the other hand, appeared to pit key socioeconomic groups in a life-or-death 
struggle and was widely seen by contemporary observers as marking a historical departure. 
Through their interpretations, which exert a continuing influence on our understanding of the 
revolutionary process, the impact of the events of June has been magnified, while, as an 
unintended consequence, the significance of the February insurrection has been diminished. 
Second, like other “successful” insurrections, the events of February failed to generate the 
most desirable kinds of historical records. Although the June insurrection of 1848 and the 
Paris Commune of 1871 would be considered watersheds of nineteenth-century French history 
by any standard, they also present the social historian with a signal advantage: these failed 
insurrections created a mass of invaluable documentation as a by-product of authorities’ 
efforts to search out and punish the rebels.
Quite different is the outcome of successful insurrections like those of July 1830 and February 
1848. Experiences are retold, but participants typically resume their daily routines without ever 
recording their activities. Those who played salient roles may become the objects of highly 
embellished verbal accounts or in rare cases, of celebratory articles in contemporary 
periodicals. And it is true that the publicly acknowledged leaders of an uprising frequently write 
memoirs. However, such documents are likely to be highly unreliable, unrepresentative, and 
unsystematically preserved, especially when compared to the detailed judicial dossiers 
prepared for everyone arrested following a failed insurrection.
As a consequence, it may prove difficult or impossible to establish for a successful revolution a 
comprehensive and trustworthy picture of those who participated, or to answer even the most 
basic questions one might pose concerning the social origins of the insurgents.
1. With which of the following statements regarding revolution would the author most likely
agree?
A. Revolutionary mobilization requires a great deal of planning by people representing
disaffected groups.
B. The objectives of the February Revolution were more radical than those of the June
insurrection.
C. The process of revolutionary mobilization varies greatly from one revolution to the next.
D. Revolutions vary greatly in the usefulness of the historical records that they produce.
E. As knowledge of the February Revolution increases, chances are good that its importance
will eventually eclipse that of the June insurrection.
169


2. Which of the following is the most logical objection to the claim made in the last paragraph?
A. The February Revolution of 1848 is much less significant than the July insurrection of 1830.
B. The backgrounds and motivations of participants in the July insurrection of 1830 have been
identified, however cursorily.
C. Even less is known about the July insurrection of 1830 than about the February Revolution
of 1848.
D. Historical records made during the July insurrection of 1830 are less reliable than those
made during the May insurrection of 1871.
E. The importance of the July insurrection of 1830 has been magnified at the expense of the
significance of the February Revolution of 1848.
3. The purpose of the second paragraph is to explain why
A. the people of Paris revolted in February 1848 against the rule of Louis-Philippe
B. there exist excellent narrative accounts of the February Days
C. the February Revolution met with little resistance
D. a useful description of the participants in the February Revolution is lacking
E. the February Revolution failed to generate any real sense of historical drama
4. It can be inferred from the passage that the author considers which of the following
essential for understanding a revolutionary mobilization?
A. a comprehensive theory of revolution that can be applied to the major insurrections of the
nineteenth century
B. awareness of the events necessary for a revolution to be successful
C. access to narratives and memoirs written by eyewitnesses of a given revolution
D. the historical perspective provided by the passage of a considerable amount of time
E. knowledge of the socioeconomic backgrounds of a revolution’s participants

 Passage 153
In the late nineteenth century, art critics regarded seventeenth-century Dutch paintings as 
direct reflections of reality. The paintings were discussed as an index of the democracy of a 
society that chose to represent its class, action, and occupations exactly as they were, wide-
ranging realism was seen as the great accomplishment of Dutch art. However, the 
achievement of more recent study of Dutch art has been the recovery of the fact that such 
paintings are to be taken as symbolizing mortality, the renaissance of earthly life, and the 
power of God, and as message that range from the mildly moralizing to the firmly didactic. 
How explicit and consistent the symbolizing process was intended to be is a much thornier 
matter, but anyone who has more familiarity than a passing acquaintance with Dutch literature 
or with the kinds of images used in illustrated books (above all emblem books) will know how 
much less pervasive was the habit of investing ordinary objects than of investing scenes with 
meaning that go beyond their surface and outward appearance. In the mid-1960s, Eddy de 
Jongh published an extraordinary array of material—especially from the emblem books and 
vernacular literature—that confirmed the unreliability of taking Dutch pictures at surface value 
alone.
The major difficulty, however, with the findings of critics such as de Jongh is that it is not easy 
to assess the multiplicity of levels in which Dutch viewers interpreted these pictures. De 
Jongh’s followers typically regard the pictures as purely symbolic. Not every object within 
Dutch paintings need be interpreted in terms of the gloss given to its equivalent representation 
in the emblem books. Not every foot warmer is to be interpreted in terms of the foot warmer in 
Rowmer Visscher’s Sinnepoppen of 1614, not every bridle is an emblem of restraint (though 
many were indeed just that).
To maintain as Brown does, that the two children in Netscher’s painting A Lady Teaching a 
Child to Read stand for industry and idleness is to fail to understand that the painting has a 
variety of possible meanings, even though the picture undoubtedly carriers unmistakable 
symbolic meanings, too. Modern Art historians may well find the discovery of parallels between 
a painting and a specific emblem exciting, they may, like seventeenth-century viewers, search 
for the double that lie behind many paintings. But seventeenth-century response can hardly be 
reduced to the level of formula. To suggest otherwise is to imply a laboriousness of mental 
process that may well characterize modern interpretations of seventeenth-century Dutch Art, 
but that was, for the most part, not characteristic in the seventeenth century.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with which of the following?
A. reconciling two different points of view about how art reflects
B. criticizing a traditional method of interpretation
C. tracing the development of an innovative scholarly approach
D. describing and evaluating a recent critical approach
E. describing a long-standing controversy and how it was resolved
2. The author of the passage mentions bridles in the highlighted portion of the passage most
likely in order to
A. suggest that restraint was only one of the many symbolic meanings attached to bridles
B. provide an example of an everyday, physical object that was not endowed with symbolic
meaning
C. provide an example of an object that modern critics have endowed with symbolic meaning
different from the meaning assigned it by seventeenth-century Dutch artists
D. provide an example of an object with symbolic meaning that was not always used as a
symbol
E. provide an example of an everyday object that appears in a significant number of
seventeenth century Dutch paintings
171


3. Which of the following best describes the function of the last paragraph of the passage?
A. It provides specific applications of the critical approach introduced in the preceding
paragraph
B. It present a caveat about the critical approach discussed in the preceding paragraph
C. It presents the research on which a theory presented in the preceding paragraph is based
D. It refutes a theory presented in the preceding paragraph and advocates a return to a more
traditional approach
E. It provides further information about the unusual phenomenon described in the preceding
paragraph
4. The passage suggests which of the following about emblem books in seventeenth-century
Holland?
A. They confirm that seventeenth century Dutch painting depict some objects and scenes
rarely found in daily life.
B. They are more useful than vernacular literature in providing information about the symbolic
content of seventeenth-century Dutch painting.
C. They have been misinterpreted by art critics, such as de Jongh, who claim seventeenth-
century Dutch paintings contain symbolic meaning
D. They are not useful in interpreting seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting.
E. They contain material that challenges the assumptions of the nineteenth-century critics
about seventeenth-century Dutch painting.
172


 Passage 154
Late-eighteenth-century English cultural authorities seemingly concurred that women readers 
should favor history, seen as edifying, than fiction, which was regarded as frivolous and 
reductive. Readers of Marry Ann Hanway’s novel Andrew Stewart, or the Northern 
Wanderer, learning that its heroine delights in David Hume’s and Edward Gibbon’s 
histories, could conclude that she was more virtuous and intelligent than her sister, 
who disdains such reading. Likewise, while the naïve, novel-addicted protagonist of Jane 
Austen’s Northanger Abbey, Catherine Morland, finds history a chore, the sophisticated, 
sensible character Eleanor Tilney enjoys it more than she does the Gothic fiction Catherine 
prefers. Yet in both cases, the praise of history is more double-edged than it might actually 
appear. Many readers have detected a protofeminist critique of history in Catherine’s protest 
that she dislikes reading books filled with men “and hardly any women at all.” Hanway, 
meanwhile, brings a controversial political edge to her heroine’s reading, listing the era’s two 
most famous religious skeptics among her preferred authors. While Hume’s history was 
generally seen as being less objectionable than his philosophy, there were widespread doubts 
about his moral soundness even as a historian by the time that Hanway was writing, and 
Gibbon’s perceived tendency to celebrate classical paganism sparked controversy from the 
first appearance of his history of Rome.
1. The author’s primary purpose is that
A. the evidence used in support of a particular argument is questionable
B. a distinction between two genres of writing has been overlooked
C. a particular issue is more complex than it might appear
D. two apparently different works share common features
E. two eighteenth-century authors held significantly different attitudes toward a particular
2. According to the passage, which of the following is true of Hume’s reputation in the late
eighteenth century?
A. He was more regarded as a historian than Gibbon
B. His historical writing, like his philosophical writing, came to be regarded as problematic
C. He was more well-known for his historical writing than for his philosophical writing
D. His historic writing came to be regarded as morally questionable because of his association
with Gibbon
E. His views about classical paganism brought him disapproval among the general reading
public
3. The highlighted sentence exemplifies which of the following?
A. cultural authorities’ attempt to use novels to support their view about the value of reading
fiction
B. eighteenth-century women authors’ attempts to embody in their work certain cultural
authorities’ views about reading
C. a point about the educational value of reading books about history
D. an instance in which a particular judgment about the value of reading history is apparently
presupposed
E. a challenge to an assumption about eighteenth-century women’s reading habits
4. The author mentions the “widespread doubts” in order to
A. support a point about the scholarly merit of Hume’s writings
B. contrast Hume’s philosophical writing with his writing on historical subjects
C. suggest that Hanway did not understand the implicit controversy depicting her heroine as
reading Hume
D. identify an ambiguity in Hanway’s depiction of the philosopher in The Northern Wanderer
E. illustrate a point about a way eighteenth-century fiction sometimes represented historians

 Passage 155
Columnist: Until very recently, Presorbin and Veltrex, two medications used to block excess 
stomach acid, were both available only with a prescription written by a doctor. In an 
advertisement for Presorbin, its makers argue that Presorbin is superior on the grounds that 
doctors have written 200 million prescriptions for Presorbin, as compared to 100 million for 
Veltrex. It can be argued that the number of prescriptions written is never a worthwhile 
criterion for comparing the merits of medicines, but that the advertisement’s argument is 
absurd is quite adequately revealed by observing that Presorbin was available as a 
prescription medicine years before Veltrex was.
In the columnist’s argument, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles?
A. The first is a claim that the columnist’s argument seeks to clarify; the second states a
conclusion drawn about one possible interpretation of that claim.
B. The first identifies the conclusion of an argument that the columnist’s argument is directed
against; the second states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument.
C. The first states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument; the second states a
conclusion that the columnist draws in defending that conclusion against an objection.
D. The first identifies an assumption made in an argument that the columnist's argument is
directed against; the second states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument.
E. The first is a claim that has been offered as evidence to support a position that the
columnist opposes; the second states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument.
Passage 156
Stylistic evidence and laboratory evidence strongly support the claim that the magnificent 
painting Garden of Eden is a work of the Flemish master van Eyck. Nevertheless, the painting 
must have been the work of someone else, as anyone with a little historical and zoological 
knowledge can tell merely by looking at the painting. The animals in the painting are all 
vivid representations of actual animals, including armadillos. Yet armadillos are native 
only to Americas, and van Eyck died decades before Europeans reached the Americas.
In the argument given, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles?
A. The first is a position that the argument seeks to reject, the second is evidence that the
argument uses against that position.
B. The first and the second are each pieces of evidence that have been used to support the
position that the argument opposes.
C. The first presents the main conclusion of the argument; the second provides evidence in
support of that conclusion.
D. The first is a judgment that serves as the basis for the main conclusion of the argument; the
second states that main conclusion.
E. The first is an intermediate conclusion drawn in order to support a further conclusion stated
in the argument; the second provides evidence in support of that intermediate conclusion.
174


 Passage 157
New methods developed in genetic research have led taxonomists to revise their views on the 
evolutionary relationships between many species. Traditionally the relatedness of species has 
been ascertained by a close comparison of their anatomy. The new methods infer the 
closeness of any two species’ relationship to each other directly from similarities between the 
species’ genetic codes.
Which of the following conclusions is best supported by the information?
A. The apparent degree of relatedness of some species, as determined by anatomical criteria,
is not borne out by their degree of genetic similarity.
B. When they know the differences between two species’ genetic codes, taxonomists can infer
what the observable anatomical differences between those species must be.
C. The degree to which individuals of the same species are anatomically similar is determined
more by their genetic codes than by such environmental factors as food supply.
D. The traditional anatomical methods by which taxonomists investigated the relatedness of
species are incapable of any further refinement.
E. Without the use of genetic methods, taxonomists would never be able to obtain any
accurate information about species’ degrees of relatedness to one another.
Passage 158
Sportfishers introduced the Zander, a type of perch, to Britain’s rivers and canals in the 1970s. 
Because zander eat large numbers of smaller fish, they have had a devastating effect on 
native fish populations. To protect the native fish, a government program removed a significant 
proportion of the zander from Britain’s waterways last year. Surprisingly, this year the loss of 
native fish to zander has been greater than before.
Which of the following, if true, would most help to explain the greater effect of zander on the 
native fish population?
A. The climate in Britain is very similar to the climate in regions to which zander are native.
B. Most of the zander removed were fully grown, and fully grown zander eat large numbers of
smaller zander.
C. Every year a large number of zander are caught by sportfisher in Britain’s waterway.
D. Previous government programs designed to remove nonnative species from Britain’s
waterways have failed.
E. Zander are just one of several nonnative fish that prey on the other fish found in Britain’s
waterway.
175


 Passage 159
There are many structural and thematic similarities between Piers Plowman by Langland 
(1330-1400) and House of Fame by Chaucer (1342-1400), two Middle English poems relating 
dream visions. Some critics have argued that because a number of the shared elements are 
uncommon in Middle English poetry, and because Langland’s poem probably predates 
Chaucer’s by a few years, Chaucer was most likely influenced by Piers Plowman when writing 
House of Fame.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the critics’ argument?
A. Piers Plowman is one of Langland’s major works, whereas House of Fame is a minor work
of Chaucer’s.
B. House of Fame survives in only three manuscript copies, substantially fewer than the
number of manuscript copies that exist of Piers Plowman.
C. Because Piers Plowman became a well-known work in its day, it is likely that the similarities
between it and House of Fame were detected by many of the people who read House of Fame
soon after Chaucer wrote it.
D. Many of the themes and structures of Piers Plowman are also found in Latin, Italian, French
works with which Chaucer could well have been familiar.
E. There is no evidence that Chaucer and Langland ever met or that they corresponded with
each other about literary topics.
Passage 160
The Great Sphinx is a huge statue in Egypt that has a lion’s body with a man’s head. The face 
of the Sphinx has long been claimed to be that of pharaoh Khafre, who lived around 2600 
B.C., but it cannot be: erosion patterns recently discovered on the lion’s legs can only have
been caused by heavy rains, and the Sahara has not had heavy rains in over 10,000 years.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A. The face of the Sphinx bears a resemblance to the faces on certain stylized statues dating
from both before and after the reign of Khafre.
B. Other erosion patterns that appear on the body of the Sphinx are of a sort that could be
caused by wind and sand alone
C. Other than the Sphinx, there are no surviving sculptures that have been claimed to portray
the face of Khafre.
D. In the last 10,000 years the climate of Egypt has been so dry that even rains that are not
heavy have been extremely infrequent.
E. The face of the Sphinx is small relative to the rest of the head, indicating that the face may
have been recarved long after the Sphinx was built.
176


 Passage 161 
Although initially symptomless, glaucoma can eventually cause blindness when not properly 
treated. Tests under laboratory conditions of the traditional treatment, daily administration of 
eyedrops, show it to be as effective in relieving the internal ocular pressure that causes 
glaucoma as is a new laser-surgical procedure. Yet glaucoma-related blindness occurs in a 
significantly smaller percentage of patients who have had the surgery than of patients for 
whom only the eyedrop treatment was prescribed.
Which of following, if true, most helps to explain the low rate glaucoma-related blindness 
among patients who had the surgery?
A. Glaucoma-related blindness is no more common among patients who have had only the
surgery than it is among patients who had the surgery after using the eyedrops
B. Doctors rarely recommend the surgery for glaucoma patients who have already started the
traditional course of treatment
C. There is no known physiological cause of glaucoma other than increase in pressure inside
the eye
D. A significant percentage of the people for whom the eyedrop treatment has been prescribed
fail to follow the prescribed daily regimen, because the eyedrops have unpleasant side effects.
E. The eyedrops traditionally prescribed to treat glaucoma are normally prescribed to treat
other disease of the eye.
Passage 162
In mountainous regions, the timberline is the highest altitude at which trees grow. In the Rocky 
Mountains, the current timberline is at the altitude above which growing season temperatures 
remain cooler than 10 degrees centigrade. Fossilized remains of trees that grew 10,000 years 
ago have been found 100 meters above the current Rocky Mountain timberline. Clearly, 
therefore, the climate of the Rocky Mountains is cooler now than it was 10,000 years ago.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?
A. In the past 10,000 years, the only trees to have grown above today's timberline are the
trees whose fossilized remains been found.
B. No trees grew 10,000 years ago at altitudes higher than the ones at which fossilized tree
remains have been found.
C. The fossils are not of species of trees that were able to tolerate cooler growing
temperatures than are the species that currently grow near the timberline.
D. The Rocky Mountains have not eroded significantly over the past 10,000 years.
E. The climate of the Rocky Mountains has never been significantly warmer than during the
lifetime of the trees whose fossilized remains have been found.
177


 Passage 163
Cotton grass, which grows only in arctic regions, has been the only summertime source of 
protein available to caribou. Caribou that do not get adequate amounts of protein in the 
summer are unable to reproduce the following year. Rising average temperatures in arctic 
regions, however, are causing cotton grass to disappear. Therefore, if the warming trend 
continues, caribou are likely to become extinct.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A. cotton grass is the only one of the caribou’s food sources that is becoming scarce as
temperatures rise in arctic regions.
B. caribou that do not eat enough protein to reproduce do not live as long as caribou that do
C. The warming trend in arctic regions will not enable other plants capable of providing protein
to caribou to grow there.
D. The caribou is the only animal that depends on cotton grass as a major source of food.
E. If the warming trend continues and cotton grass disappears from arctic regions, then cotton
grass will be extinct.
Passage 164
Although the percentage of first graders in Almaria who were excellent readers varied little 
between 1995 and 2010, the percentage of first graders who had considerable difficulty 
reading their schoolbooks increased markedly during that period. This evidence strongly 
indicates that the average reading ability of first graders decreased between 1995 and 2010.
Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest additional support for the argument?
A. The number of hours devoted to reading activities in first-grade classrooms in Almaria did
not vary significantly, on average, between 1995 and 2010.
B. The percentage of first graders in Almaria who had difficulty solving arithmetic problems did
not increase as much between 1995 and 2010 as did the percentage of first graders who had
reading difficulties.
C. The number of children in Almaria who were enrolled as first graders decreased steadily
between 1995 and 2010.
D. The average difficulty of the schoolbooks used in first-grade classrooms in Almaria
decreased between 1995 and 2010.
E. The average number of schoolbooks used in first-grade classrooms in Almaria increased
between 1995 and 2010.
178


 Passage 165
The Minoan civilization flourished on the island of Crete around 2000 B.C. The discovery on 
Crete of large numbers of bronze implements and the furnaces used in their manufacture 
shows that the Minoans had a thriving bronze industry. Moreover, many bronze artifacts from 
this period that are similar in style to those produced on Crete have been found in southern 
Greece. Hence it is probable that, besides making bronzeware for domestic use, the Minoans 
exported bronzeware to southern Greece.
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument given?
A. Copper and tin, the main ingredients of bronze, were present in Southern Greece.
B. No furnaces dating from the Minoan era and suitable for the manufacture of bronze
implements have been found in southern Greece.
C. The Minoans exported a great deal of pottery, which was highly valued by other ancient
civilizations.
D. The fuel needed for Minoan bronzeware furnaces was provided by a variety of local species
of hardwood.
E. Some of the pieces of bronzeware found on Crete were non-Minoan in origin.
Passage 166
Although several ancient cultures practiced mummification, mummies from ancient Egypt are 
generally more well-preserved than mummies of similar antiquity from other cultures. One 
possible explanation for this difference is that the mummification techniques or material used 
by ancient Egyptians were better than those of other cultures. A second, more likely, 
explanation is that the extremely dry climate of ancient Egypt was largely responsible, given 
that dryness promotes the preservation of organic remains generally.
Which is the following provide the most support for the argument?
A. The materials used by ancient Egyptians for mummification were not used by any other
ancient culture that practiced mummification
B. Some ancient Egyptian mummies are better preserved than other ancient Egyptian
mummies form around the same time.
C. No ancient people living in very damp areas practiced mummification.
D. Bodies from ancient Egyptian tombs dating from before the practice of mummification
began are almost as well preserved as ancient Egyptian mummies.
E. Ancient mummies discovered in places other than Egypt have typically not been as well
protected from the elements as ancient Egyptian mummies were.

 Passage 167
The economy of Colonia has been in recession for the past eight years. Most companies that 
have not been forced into bankruptcy have survived thanks to the high efficiency of the 
employees they retained, which helped the companies control costs. In recent months, 
however, the Colonian economy has begun to recover, and companies are beginning to 
expand their workforces. Colonia, therefore, will soon experience a drop in average worker 
efficiency, since ______.
Which of the following, if true, most logically complete the argument?
A. people who have been employed throughout the recession will, no doubt, continue to be
employed
B. Colonia is expected to begin importing more goods from other countries
C. most companies will find that few of the workers available for hiring are as efficient as those
they retained during the recession.
D. during the recession, workers did not receive any raise in their pay.
E. many companies that were forced into bankruptcy in the past eight years had a fair number
of efficient workers.
Passage 168
A hoard of coins recently unearthed at an ancient Carthagian site bear an image of a face in 
profile with what appears to be a large mole on the cheek. Pointing out that an artist would be 
unlikely to include such a specific detail in a generalized portrayal of a face, some 
archaeologists have concluded that these coins portray an actual individual rather than an 
idealized type. However, this conclusion is unwarranted, since ______.
Which of the following most logically completes the argument?
A. archaeologists cannot determine the actual identity of the individual portrayed just from the
likeness that appears on the coins
B. it cannot be established with certainty that Carthagian artists were on the whole less skillful
at portraying human face than artists of other cultures
C. none of the other designs of Carthagian coins that have been discovered features a face
with a mole on it
D. in ancient times it was quite common for the money circulated in a city or country to include
coins that originated in other jurisdictions.
E. the relatively soft metal used for Carthagian coin molds sometimes resulted in the
production of series of coins with unintended bumps

 Passage 169 
People widely believed that the controlled use of fire originated 200,000 years ago with the 
human species Homo sapiens. However, a site containing a deposit, estimated to be nearly 
500,000 years old, consisting of charcoal, burned animal bones, and charred rocks, has 
recently been found. Although homo sapiens did not exist at that time, this discovery provides 
no basis to the claim that the controlled use of fire preceded the Homo sapiens, since ______.
Which of the following most logically completes the passage?
A. the use of fire might have originated independently in several different parts of the world
B. it is possible that fire was used much earlier than 500,000 years ago
C. the charred rocks found in the deposit included several different kinds of stone, all of which
are common in the immediate vicinity of the site
D. animal bones could have been discarded in a fire used for purposes such as protection or
heat rather than for cooking
E. it is impossible to determine whether a charred deposit dating from so long ago resulted
from a fire caused by lightening or from the purposeful use of fire
Passage 170
Because of strong overall stylistic similarities, prehistoric cave paintings in El Castillo, Spain 
and others in Altamira, Spain, were thought to date from the same period. Recent pigment 
analyses, however, established the Altamira paintings as by far the older and as about the 
same age as a third group of paintings done in a different overall style. Nevertheless, this case 
does not prove that stylistic similarities cannot be a reliable indicator of closeness in age, 
since _____.
Which of the following most logically completes the passage?
A. experts who knew the results of the pigment analyses reexamined these paintings and
found no previously unnoticed stylistic similarities between the Altamira paintings and the
paintings in the third group
B. there are certain stylistic features that the Altamira paintings share with all known paintings
of their period and do not share with the El Castillo paintings
C. before dating by pigment analysis was widely practiced, stylistic similarities were the only
means of determining whether two prehistoric cave paintings dated from the same period
D. determining the age of a prehistoric cave painting simply by reference to the age of the
pigments used in that painting substitutes technology for artistic judgment
E. there are experts who maintain that the results of the recent pigment analyses leave the
striking stylistic similarities between the El Castillo paintings and the Altamira paintings
unexplained

 passage 171
Members of the San, a hunter-gatherer society, have a diet far richer in fruits and vegetables 
and lower in salt than is typical in industrialized societies. They also differ from industrialized 
societies in that they have extremely low rates of high blood pressure and obesity. However, 
contrary to what some have claimed, if people in industrialized societies adopted the San’s 
diet, the incidence of high blood pressure and obesity in these societies might not be 
dramatically reduced, because _____.
Which of the following most logically completes the passage?
A. psychological stress, which can also cause high blood pressure, occurs in both
industrialized and nonindustrialized societies
B. the San’s low-salt diet is due, not to preference, but to the limited availability of salt in their
region
C. a few members of the San have been found to suffer from circulatory system ailments other
than high blood pressure
D. members of the San are far more physically active than are most members of industrialized
societies
E. not all individuals with high blood pressure are obese

 Passage 172
This passage discusses Mionan buildings constructed during the Bronze Age on the Greek 
Island of Crete.
Although the term “Palace” is widely used and deeply ingrained in Minoan archaeology, 
Driesen has marked that term has been used to describe a number of quite different things 
and that there is no consensus on what the term signifies. The debate usually centers on the 
presumed functions of the building. Evans assumes that the building known as Places has 
several roles, including royal residences, administrative centers, economic centers, 
manufacturing centers, and cult centers. Over the years, each of those functions has been 
called into questions. For example, Schoep notes, “The use of the term Place carries with it 
a whole host of perhaps unhelpful baggage, which consciously or unconsciously 
encourages interpretation of the “Palace” as the residence of a royal elite, occupying 
supreme position within a hierarchical social and political structure”, she suggests using 
the more neutral term “court-centered building” instead. The problem, however, come not 
from the architectural label one applies, but from making unwarranted assumptions about how 
the Palaces were used. I use the word “Palaces” (capitalized to signal its arbitrariness) not to 
imply a range of functions but to refer to a group of buildings that share a set of formal 
elements.
1. Select a sentence in the passage that summarizes the author’s primary opposition to a
particular approach taken by Minoan archaeologists.
2. The author would most likely agree with which of the following as response to Schoep’s
argument for using a “more neutral term”?
A. The term that Schoep favors would exclude some sites that ought to be included in the
category.
B. Given the profusion of terms that archaeologists have applied to the building that have been
called Palaces, it is redundant to introduce another one.
C. If a new term is introduced, it should be based on the known functions of the buildings that
have been called Palaces, rather than on theory formal architectural features.
D. It is possible to use the term “Palace” without being committed to the term’s functional
implications.
E. It is not true that the buildings that have been called Palaces are the only evidence for a
hierarchical social structure in Minoan society.
3. The author would most likely agree with which of the following statements about the use of
the term “Palace” in Minoan archaeology?
A. It is useful largely as a matter of convention
B. It should be replaced by a more neutral term
C. It is the correct term for most of the Minoan buildings to which it has been applied.
D. It has only recently become popular among archaeologists.
E. It has been used to describe buildings that are formally dissimilar to one another.
4. The author would most likely agree with which of the following statements about the buildings
discussed in the passage?
A. They possess a discernible architectural cohesiveness as a group.
B. They probably all had the same or a similar function.
C. They almost certainly were not used as royal residences.
D. They were more likely to be used as administrative centers than as manufacturing centers.
E. They are architecturally similar to a number of other buildings on Crete.
183


5. The author of the passage suggests which of the following about the term “Palace” in Minoan
archaeology?
A. It is used by many Minoan archaeologists.
B. It is a term that I. Schoep recommends replacing.
C. There is little agreement as to the function of the buildings designated by the term.
6. The highlighted quotation from I. Schoep serves in part to
A. suggest that the debate surrounding the Palaces’ function has been misguided
B. caution against a particular understanding of the Palaces’ function
C. articulate a hypothesis about the Palaces’ function that the author goes on to critique
D. explain why the Palaces were probably not used as residences by a royal elite
E. support a claim by the author that the term “Palace” should no longer be used

 Passage 173
Recently, researchers investigated the foraging profiles of bird species in two separate 
eucalyptus forests in Australia: Dryandra in Western Australia and the Southern Tablelands, 
roughly 3000 km west in New South Wales. Despite their geographical separation, there is a 
broad overlap in species between the two locations. However, at Dryandra, a much larger 
proportion of species (61 percent) than at the Southern Tablelands (34 percent) are ground 
foragers.
The high proportion of ground foragers in Dryandra might be explained by the openness of 
habitats there, that is, the absence of dense ground vegetation, and the lack of a continuous 
shrub layer. Ground foraging appears to be facilitated by an open habitat with area of bare 
ground. However, the researchers found that the Tablelands were also open with sparse to 
dense litter layers, abundant in woody debris, and had discontinuous or absent ground and 
shrub layers. Thus, differences in habitat structures between these areas and Dryandra cannot 
entirely explain the greater abundance of ground foragers in Dryandra.
The researchers offered several hypotheses to explain the difference. First, there may be 
important differences in habitat structure that are not revealed by casual observation. For 
example, differences in tree heights and canopy complexity may contribute to differences in 
species richness and foraging behavior among bark- and foliage-foraging birds. Second, 
despite structural similarities, it is possible that there are differences between habitats in the 
abundance or availability of litter and ground-dwelling prey. Such differences, if they exist, may 
indicate fundamental differences between eucalypt ecosystems in how and where energy and 
nutrients are cycled, as well as in overall productivity. Finally, the differences in foraging 
profiles between Dryandra and Tablelands may be the result of historical changes in bird 
species as a consequence of changed grazing and fire regimens, the impact of introduced 
predators, such as foxes and feral cats, and logging following European settlement. The 
greatest impact of these processes is on ground-foraging and ground-nesting birds. Dryandra 
has not been free of these changes, but the impact may have been less or more recent 
with the result that Dryandra may retain a more natural or complete bird diversity 
relative to the Tablelands.
1. Which of the following best describes the organization of the second paragraph?
A. A thesis is proposed and supporting examples are provided.
B. A thesis is presented, considered, and then rejected.
C. Opposing views are described and the evidence on which they are based is evaluated.
D. An argument is described, rejected, and then an alternative is presented.
E. A hypothesis is presented, weighed, qualified, and then reaffirmed.
2. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context
of the passage as a whole?
A. It reconciles two conflicting theories discussed earlier in the passage.
B. It provides an example of a general tendency described earlier in the passage.
C. It suggests the relevance of phenomena mentioned in the previous sentence.
D. It provides support for a claim made in the first paragraph.
E. It provides evidence for a hypothesis discussed in the second paragraph.
3. The passage suggests which of the following about “canopy complexity”?
A. Decreased canopy complexity can lead to a greater abundance of ground foragers.
B. Increased canopy complexity usually helps in retaining a more natural bird diversity.
C. Increased canopy complexity is usually detrimental to ground-nesting species.
D. Differences in canopy complexity between two regions are not always obvious.
E. Differences in foraging behavior among foliage-foraging birds can lead to differences in
canopy complexity.
185


4. The author suggests which of the following about “foxes and feral cats”
A. They may have benefited from the logging that followed European settlement.
B. They probably affect the overall productivity of the ecosystem
C. They feed primarily on ground-foraging birds.
D. They rarely, if ever, feed on tree-nesting birds.
E. They may have had a smaller impact on Dryandra than on the Tablelands.
Passage 174
Before 1970, children in the United States were commonly vaccinated against smallpox. In the 
early 1970s, large-scale vaccinations of children against smallpox were discontinued because 
smallpox had virtually disappeared from the world. Recently, some scientists have cautioned 
that the Unite States could be exposed to smallpox again. Contrary to what many people 
believe, this exposure would probably find all age-groups within the United States population 
at comparable levels of risk of contracting smallpox, since _____.
Which of the following most logically completes the passage?
A. smallpox is a highly communicable disease among people who are not immune to it
B. smallpox vaccine is not now widely available in the United States
C. the population of the United States has been growing more slowly since 1970 than it was
before then
D. smallpox vaccinations lose their efficacy after about 20 years
E. people in the United States travel more than they did in 1970, thereby increasing the
chances that an epidemic could spread
Passage 175
Madagascar’s Mahafale cattle raisers have incorporated the prickly pear cactus into their 
pastoral economy, which depends on assisting their cattle through the dry season, when grass 
and water are scarce. Rather than relying on nomadism in the pursuit of water and pasture for 
their livestock, they have turned to cactus to keep stock alive. This has influenced the cattle 
raisers’ way of life, particularly in terms of diet and mobility. Women harvest cactus for their 
families to eat. Male herders work cactus as a vegetable crop for cattle. For these benefits, 
pastoralists sow, prune, and shape prickly pear into living fences around their corrals. In doing 
so, these herders have become cactus cultivators, which has reduced their mobility.
1. Select the sentence in the passage that tells how the prickly pear has affected the Mahafale
diet.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. Which of the following is mentioned in the passage as an affect of cactus cultivation on the
Mahafale’s pastoralist way of life?
A. The Mahafale no longer need to help their cattle survive during the dry season.
B. The Mahafale have abandoned their pastoralist way of life.
C. The mobility of the Mahafale has been diminished.

 Passage 176
Catherine Stimpson calls for a reassessment of literary merit based on affective standards—on 
how literary works make readers feel—rather than on the aesthetic standards traditionally 
used to define the canon, the body of literary works generally accepted as “great”. Stimpson 
advocates an alterative para canon for literary works, such as Louisa May Alcott’s Little 
Women, because she believes such works have been unjustifiably neglected by 
unsympathetic scholars. According to Stimpson, a para canonical work may or may not have 
literary value by traditional standards; rather, its worth consists in its “capacity to inspire love.”
Elizabeth Barnes criticizes Stimpson’s approach as subjective and therefore uncritical 
“Although Stimpson never actually defines ‘love,’ she implies that a lovable work is one that so 
engages the reader that its worldview becomes inseparable from the reader’s own” (Stimpson 
acknowledges that the values reflected in Little Women may have subconsciously influenced 
her invention of the para canon). For Barnes ,the conflation of ethics and aesthetics implicit in 
Stimpson’s approach (in which “good ”can refer to something morally sound and/or above 
average in quality) demonstrates the ambiguity inherent in such concepts as goodness and 
love.
1. According to the passage, Stimpson advocated the creation of a paracanon because she
A. found many of the works that were included in the canon to be uninspiring
B. rejected the ethical standards reflected in many canonical works
C. failed to convince other scholars that some of her favorite works should be added to the
canon
D. felt that the values of some works has gone unrecognized by critics who are concerned only
with traditional aesthetic standards
E. insisted on strict adherence to traditional standards for the evaluation of literature
2. The author of the passage mentions Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women primarily in order to
provide an example of a work that
A. the author of the passage feels has been inappropriately excluded from the canon
B. the author of the passage and Stimpson agree is emotionally satisfying
C. Stimpson feels has not been sufficiently appreciated by scholars
D. conforms to Barnes’s ethical and aesthetic standards
E. presents an ambiguous view of the concept of love
3. It can be inferred from the passage that Barnes would be most likely to agree with which of
the following characterizations of Stimpson’s approach to assessing literary works?
A. It requires the application of more exacting standards than are traditionally employed
B. Its application would result in the exclusion from the para canon of most of the works
included in the canon
C. It accords recognition to too large and diverse a body of literature
D. It involves the use of a criterion that is not rigorously defined
E. It results in evaluations that are more objective than those based on traditional aesthetic
standards

 Passage 177
Oscillatory swimming—the alternating of deep dives with forays toward the surface—is among 
the most common behaviors of large marine animals in the open ocean. The reason most 
often proposed for this behavior is to warm the body after heat loss during descent into cooler 
water. Tuna, mako sharks, and white sharks maintain an internal body temperature above that 
of the surrounding waters thereby improving their muscular efficiency and enabling them to 
swim with bursts of speed.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. According to the passage, maintaining an internal body temperature above that of
surrounding waters enables certain marine animals to
A. use their muscles with greater efficiency
B. swim faster than usual for short periods
C. alternate between deep diving and surface swimming
2. In the context in which it appears, “forays” most nearly means
A. trips
B. attacks
C. attempts
D. adventures
E. encroachment

 Passage 178
For most of the twentieth century, scholars generally accepted the proposition that nations are 
enduring entities that predated the rise of modern nation-states and that provided the social 
and cultural foundations of the state. This perspective has certainly been applied to Korea; 
most historians have assumed that the Korean nation has existed since the dawn of historical 
time. In recent years, however, Western scholars have questioned the idea of the nation as an 
enduring entity. Both Gellner and Anderson have argued, in their studies of European, Latin 
American, and Southeast Asian cases, that the nation is strictly a modern phenomenon, a 
forging of a common sense of identity among previously disparate social groups through the 
propagandizing efforts of activities of the modern state. In short, it was the state that created 
the nation, not the other way around.
Younger Koreanists, with Em prominent among them, have begun to apply this approach to 
Korea. These scholars, noting the isolated nature of village life in premodern Korea and the 
sharp difference in regional dialects, suggest that ordinary villagers could not possibly have 
thought of themselves as fellow countrymen of villagers in other regions. These scholars also 
not the elites, conversely, often had outward-looking, universalistic orientations, as did 
aristocracies elsewhere, such as in premodern Europe. Finally, they observe that the very 
word for “nation” in Korean, minjok, is a neologism first employed by Japanese 
scholars as translation of the Western concept and that it was first appropriated by 
Korean activists in the early twentieth century. They argue, therefore, that a Korean 
“nation” came into being only after that time.
In short, in the case of Korea we have an argument between “primordialists”, who contend that 
nations are natural and universal units of history, and “modernists”, who assert that nations are 
historically contingent products of modernity. The positions of both groups seem problematic. It 
seems unlikely that in the seventh century the peoples of the warring states of Koguryo, 
Peakche, and Shilla all thought of themselves as members of a larger “Korean” collectivity. On 
the other hand, the inhabitants of the Korean peninsula had a much longer history —well over 
one thousand years—as a unified political collectivity than did the peoples studied by Gellner 
and Anderson. Not only does the remarkable endurance of the Korean state imply some sort of 
social and cultural basis for that unity, but the nature of the premodern Korean state as a 
centralized bureaucratic polity also suggests the possibility that the organizational activities of 
the state may have created a homogenous collectivity with a sense of shared identity much 
earlier than happened in the countries of western Europe that provide the model for 
“modernist” scholarship.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. evaluate two competing views regarding the origin of the Korean nation
B. rebut a controversial perspective on the origin of the Korean nation
C. question the idea of the Korean nation as an enduring entity
D. consider the influence of the modernist positon on younger Koreanists
E. explain some of the unique features of the Korean nation
2. Select the sentence in the third paragraph that provides some information that supports the
position of younger Koreanists regarding the creation of the Korean nation.
189


3. The author would probably agree with which of the following statements regarding the work 
of Gellner and of Anderson?
A. Neither Gellner’s nor Anderson’s work has had a significant influence on the study of the
Korean nation.
B. Their argument that the nation is a strictly modern phenomenon does not hold in the case of
Korea.
C. Both of them have downplayed the propagandizing efforts of Korean intellectuals as a
means of forging a Korean identity.
D. Both of them have exaggerated the homogenizing impact of the state as a factor in the
case of nations.
E. Both them have overestimated the extent to which disparate social groups find a common
sense of identity through belonging to the same nation.
4. According to the author of the passage, a difference between Korea and the “European,
Latin American, and Southeast Asian cases” has to do with
A. the extent of the differences among various regional dialects prior to the establishment of a
national language
B. the number of disparate social groups that existed prior to the creation of a national identity
C. when a nationally unified political entity came into existence
D. whether the bureaucratic state played a role in the creation of the nation
E. the extent to which the creation of the nation fostered significantly greater social and
cultural unity
5. Regarding the observation discussed in the highlighted sentence, the author would probably
agree with which of the following statements?
A. It tells more about the nature of the Korean language than it does about the creation of the
Korean nation in the twentieth century.
B. It contradicts the idea that Korean elites had outward-looking, universalistic orientations.
C. It shows the inappropriateness of trying to apply Western concepts to the Korean experience.
D. It may be true, but it does not mean that the creation of the Korean nation is a twentieth- century
phenomenon.
E. It testiﬁes to the inﬂuence of Western and Japanese thinking on the origin of the Korean nation.
Passage 179
The pepper Capsicum chinense grows as a native wild plant only in South America. Birds 
swallow the pepper’s fruit whole, thereby providing the plant with its means of distributing 
seeds. Domesticated varieties of C.chinense grow in the Caribbean islands as well as in South 
America. Although it is unknown just when C.chinense was introduced into the islands, the 
introduction of the species was probably the result of human activity, because _____.
Which of the following most logically completes the argument?
A. the fruits of the domesticated varieties are too large for birds to swallow
B. C.chinense grows in the Caribbean islands under climatic conditions very similar to those
under which the wild variety grows
C. the peppers are an important part of the Caribbean islands’ characteristic cooking
D. most of the plant species in the Caribbean islands originated is South America
E. many of the species of birds that are found in the Caribbean islands spend only the winter
there

 Passage 180
Data of modern and historic peasant communities suggest that individuals and communities 
specialize in ceramic production for trade primarily to offset subsistence shortfalls arising from 
inadequate or insufficient agricultural land. Harry investigated whether this correlation of 
ceramic specialization with agricultural marginality occurred among prehistoric inhabitants of 
the American Southwest. At Arizona’s West Branch site, occupied A. D. 900-1100, abundant 
pottery manufacturing materials suggest villagewide ceramic production in excess of that 
needed for household purposes. 
1. The final sentence of the passage primarily serves to do which of following?
A. cite a particular factor that may have influence the decision to settle the West Branch site
B. identify a possible reason why the inhabitants of the West Branch site may have specialized
in the manufacture of ceramics
C. suggest that inhabitants of the West Branch site may have had agricultural surpluses to use
for trade with other settlements in the region
D. present evidence to support a claim that the West Branch site was not a pottery consuming
settlement
E. cite one reason to doubt that the ceramic specialization at the West Branch site served to
offset subsistence shortfalls
2. Replacement of the word “marginality” with which of the following words results in the least
change meaning for the passage?
A. peculiarity
B. insignificant
C. nonconformity
D. deficiency
E. futility
191


 Passage 181
Although Klezmer—a style of traditional Jewish folk music from Eastern Europe—grew from 
very diverse musical traditions, Roma(Gypsy), Greek, and Romanian elements eventually 
became so predominant that some scholars refused to recognized klezmer as a separate 
genre. If one listens  closely, however, one can learn to distinguish the sound of  a Klezmer 
interpretation from other related performance styles. Yiddish-speaking Jews routinely use 
several uniquely descriptive words to identify the sounds found in the Jewish approach to 
music. Krekht(Yiddish for “groan”)refers to a wailing sound reminiscent of weeping, tshok 
refers to a laugh-like instrumental sound; and a kneytsh is a sob-like “catch”. These and other 
elements typical of klezmer are also found in other forms of Jewish musical expression, 
including cantorial music.
1. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about Roma, Greek, and Romanian
music?
A. They are frequently difficult to distinguish from one another.
B. They have had a significant influence on klezmer music.
C. They were not recognized as separate genres by certain scholars.
D. They contain elements analogous to the tshok.
E. They were ignored by Yiddish-speaking Jewish musicians.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. It can be inferred that the author would be likely to agree with the highlighted “some
scholars” about whether
A. any traditions other than Roam, Greek and Romanian contributed to the development of
klezmer
B. the degree of resemblance between klezmer and the Roma, Greek, and Romanian
traditions is  enough to preclude klezmer’s being a separate musical genre
C. such musical devices as the krekhts are found throughout Jewish musical expression
Passage 182
Samples taken from the ice of glaciers show that during the last ice age there was far more 
dust in the atmosphere than there is now. Since greater amounts of dust in the atmosphere 
would result in less sunlight’s reaching the Earth’s surface, it is likely that the large amount of 
dust then present helped maintain low global temperatures and thus prolonged the ice age.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weaken the argument?
A. Large amount of dust in the atmosphere would tend to keep heat from the Sun that reached
the Earth’s surface from escaping into outer space.
B. The glacial samples show that during the period between the two most recent ice ages the
level of atmospheric dust was far lower than it was during either of ice ages.
C. Volcanic eruptions in the recent past have released sufficient dust to cause detectable
changes in global temperature patterns.
D. The amount of dust in the atmosphere was significantly greater in the middle of the last ice
age than at the end.
E. Sunlight is the main heat source of the Earth’s surface.
192


 Passage 183
Climatologists observed in 1964 that a slow warming of the surface of the North Atlantic in the 
1910s and 1920s could well have been driven by a surge of warm water up the Gulf Stream. 
This Atlantic warming accompanied a global warming that by the 1940s had produced the 
highest global temperatures to that point in the records. It was so warm that statistical 
techniques used in the 1990s to detect the “fingerprint” of greenhouse warming in climate 
records also show the 1940s having greenhouse warming. However, no one believes enough 
greenhouse gases had reached the atmosphere by then to cause much of a human-induced 
warming. That inconsistency has led greenhouse contrarians to claim that any recent 
warming could be natural rather than anthropogenic.
1. It can be inferred that the “contrarians” mentioned in the passage would agree with which of
the
A. The extent of the global warming that occurred between the 1940s and the 1990s has been
exaggerated by some climatologists.
B. Changes in global temperatures in the 1990s are a part of a trend that is distinct from any
trend that may have existed in the 1910s and 1920s.
C. Recent changes in global temperature may not be the direct result of human activity.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. Which of the following statements about the global warming observed in the 1940s is
implied by the passage?
A. It was part of a climatic change that can be traced to the 1910s and 1920s.
B. Its cause was not apparent to climatologists until the 1990s.
C. It is doubtful that it was caused primarily by greenhouse gases produced by humans.
193


 Passage 184
The area of literary rights is confusing for scholars whose work focuses on collaborative 
materials particularly materials of earlier Native American writers. Questions arise over 
authorship and the determination of literary heirs. For example, recognition of heirs turns on 
the European-based assumption of the private ownership of a written statement. The first 
person to writer down an oral tale can become legally recognized as the owner of that version 
of the story, just as the first chemist to patent a tribal healing practice becomes the owner of 
the resulting chemical formula. This instance on private rather than collective ownership, 
derived from the nineteenth-century notion of the autonomous, creative, authorial voice, flies in 
the face of those who come from an oral tradition. Thus a scholar concerned with finding 
literary heirs in order to afford them the benefits of copyright laws must in so doing accede to 
legal concept of ownership that has been used to appropriate knowledge from community-
based cultures.
1. The example of a chemical patent is used to illustrate a
A. legal mechanism by which community knowledge can be turned into private property
B. technological development that goes beyond the scope of nineteenth-century science
C. government action that creates a temporary form of intellectual property
D. kind of expression that exists only in written, rather than oral, form
E. way in which medical innovation can be rewarded
2. The author of the passage focuses on a contrast between
A. patents and copyrights as ways of protecting ownership
B. oral and written as means of artistic expression
C. literary heirs and authors of literary works as creative thinkers
D. individual and collective ownership of cultural products
E. contemporary and nineteenth-century views of authorship
3. According to the passage, the notion of a literary heir depends on a presupposition that can
be traced to
A. a confusion over the purposes of collaboration
B. a misunderstanding between people from different cultures
C. a nineteenth-century view of authors as creative individuals
D. oral traditions that hand down knowledge through generations
E. scholars who first recorded oral tales in written form

 Passage 185
In Stanton the average number of people injured per automobile accident is consistently 
higher for accidents involving a taxicab than for those not involving a taxicab. Although all 
Stanton taxicabs are equipped with passenger seat belts, taxicab drivers report that 
passengers tend not to use them. It is likely, therefore, that if taxicab passengers were 
required to use seat belts, the number of people injured per accident would soon be no higher 
for taxicabs than for other automobiles.
Which of the following, if true about Stanton, most seriously weakens the argument?
A. The number of automobile accidents has been declining in recent years.
B. Since taxicabs are driven more miles annually than most other vehicles, they are more
likely to be in an accident during any given year than is the average vehicle.
C. There are more taxicabs in operation, relative to the overall number of motor vehicles, than
there are in most cities of Stanton’s size.
D. The number of people, including the driver, who occupy a vehicle is generally greater for
taxicabs than for other vehicles.
E. Not all passengers in automobiles other than taxicabs use seat belts.
Passage 186
Growing grapes in greenhouses containing air enriched with carbon dioxide increases crop 
yields, an effect that is enhanced when the growing temperature is also raised several 
degrees. Although enclosed cultivation is impractical in vineyards, increases in yields from 
grape cultivation in the open can be expected because emissions from the burning of fossil 
fuels will almost certainly lead to an increase in the carbon dioxide content of atmospheric air 
over the next century.
1. Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?
A. When grapes are grown in greenhouses, it is relatively easy to control the grape pests that
thrive in air enriched with carbon dioxide.
B. Recent improvements in pest control have increased grape yields in many vineyards.
C. Increasing carbon dioxide levels in greenhouses has not been shown to improve the quality
of grapes grown in greenhouses.
D. Increasing carbon dioxide levels in greenhouses increases the sweetness of raisins made
from grapes grown in the greenhouses.
E. As the carbon dioxide level in the open air increases, temperatures at the Earth's surface
will also increase.
2. Which of the following would be most useful to determine the possibility that the grapes yields
increase with the raise of the temperature?
A. Whether increasing carbon dioxide levels in greenhouses improves the eating quality of the
grapes grown in the greenhouses
B. Whether in the future the market for grapes will be greater than it is now
C. Whether temperatures today often get so high in regions where grapes are grown that the
grapes suffer serious damage
D. Whether the use of greenhouses for growing grapes serves research purposes only
E. Whether the economic beneﬁts that might be derived from a major increase in world grape
production would outweigh any economic harm resulting from negative health effects associated
with increased worldwide carbon dioxide levels

 Passage 187 
One way to assess This is the American Earth, a collection of photographs selected and 
arranged by Nancy Newhall, is to apply Newshall's own criteria for judging photographic art. 
Does this photographic essay achieve results impossible in other media? By contrasting the 
small with the vast—for example, placing a photo of a rock pool next to one of a spiral galaxy
—Newhall exploits the camera's ability to manipulate the size of an object, thereby challenging 
viewers to question their conventional concepts of size. However, a similar result could be 
achieved in the medium of painting.
Does the work bear its creator's imprint, and does it draw viewers' interest even after repeated 
viewings, Newhall's second and third criteria? Indeed, Newhall's work bears her unmistakable 
imprint in the juxtaposition of the photos and in the rhythmic prose accompanying them, but 
the individual viewer must decide whether Newhall's work evokes, as it did for this reviewer, 
new experiences upon subsequent viewings.
1. According to the passage, which of the following is a way in which This is the American
Earth satisfies Newhall's criteria for judging photographic art?
A. It takes advantage of on of the camera's unique abilities.
B. It leaves viewers with a particularly strong visual impression.
C. It contains elements identifying it as a particular person's work.
D. It consistently evokes an emotional response from viewers.
E. It successfully destroys an overemphasis on humans' concept of size.
2. According to the passage, one of the criteria Newhall uses in making judgments about
photographic art is the degree to which the art
A. provides viewers with an experience what will encourage subsequent viewings
B. challenges viewers to question their preconceptions
C. evokes similar experiences for different viewers in different circumstances
D. achieve results that have not been realized by earlier works of photographic art
E. produces results that can only be achieved in the medium of photography
Passage 188
Spiders of many species change color to resemble the color of the flowers they sit on. Many 
animals that prey on such spiders possess color discrimination so acute that they, unlike 
human beings, can readily see the spiders despite the seeming camouflage. It is unlikely, 
therefore, that the spiders' color changes confer significant survival benefit on these spiders.
Which of the following would it be most useful to determine in order to evaluate the argument?
A. Whether the spiders' own ability to discriminate color-camouflaged species is as acute as
that of their predators
B. Whether the spiders have a color that could properly be regarded as their natural color
C. Whether the spiders' color-changes allow them to remain undetected by prey
D. Whether different species of color-changing spiders tend to favor different species of flower
E. Whether the color-changing spiders prey on any insects that themselves change color

 Passage 189
Most feminist labor historians believe that the emergence and rapid general adoption of 
industrial unionism in the late 1930s was essential for the success of efforts to organize large 
numbers of women workers into unions. They argue that industrial unionism's commitment to 
recruiting unskilled workers and its abandonment of racial and gender exclusiveness was more 
attractive to women workers (who, according to these scholars, were largely unskilled) than 
was the earlier exclusionary craft-union model. The successful organization of women garment 
workers in the 1910s does not undermine this dominant view, since the garment unions 
welcomed women workers of every skill level, prefiguring the industrial form of unionism.
According to the author, the successful organization of women garment workers is consistent 
with the dominant view of women labor history because
A. garment unions concentrated their recruitment efforts exclusively on attracting unskilled
workers as members
B. those women garment workers who joined the garment unions were not as skilled as those
who refused to join
C. garment unions accepted both skilled and unskilled workers as members
D. garment unions lacked exclusionary racial rules as well as rules barring unskilled workers
E. most garment workers were relatively skilled craft workers rather than unskilled workers
Passage 190
The United States Civil Rights movement, which began in the 1950s and gained momentum in 
the 1960s and 1970s, owed a heavy debt to African American newspapers. This is not to 
suggest that the African American press caused the Civil Rights era. But its continual push 
from 1910 to 1950 or more African American rights, using a compelling form of advocacy 
journalism rather than the standard objective newspaper style, allowed those who in the 1950s 
began pushing nationally for equality to start at a far higher level than if the African American 
press had not existed. This point has largely been missed by many Americans, who seen to 
believe the Civil Rights era erupted from a standstill like a dormant geyser. But that is not how 
history occurs.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. challenge a particular scholarly argument
B. identify the cause of a historical development
C. present a summary of a long-standing debate
D. explain the origins of a flawed theory
E. correct a commonly held misconception
2. According to the passage, African American newspapers contributed to the Civil Rights
movement primarily by
A. exposing bias in supposedly objective newspaper accounts
B. connecting the movement's leaders with local communities
C. providing a platform for leaders to be heard by a wide audience
D. laying the groundwork for a later national effort
E. building momentum for efforts that were already in progress

 Passage 191
Except in special situations, human beings' battle with mosquitoes will not be won by a simple 
campaign to eliminate the insects. Social tradition and habits, it seems, do much to ensure 
continual contact between mosquitoes and people. On the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, for 
example, mosquitoes breed in the leaf axils of a plant called dracaena. Although dracaena is 
not a food plant for humans, its use as a hedge or boundary marker is is deeply rooted in 
tradition. Here, as in other parts of the world, human behavior ensures contact and conflict 
between people and mosquitoes.
I am not advocating a policy of live and let live; we already know that living with mosquitoes is 
very unpleasant. But until we accomplish the difficult task of understanding how our habits 
often perpetuate--even create--our problems, efforts to resolve our battle with mosquitoes will 
probably fail.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. discussing shortsighted proposals to eliminate problems with mosquitoes
B. outlining ways in which people can alleviate the problems caused by mosquitoes
C. arguing that social traditions can perpetuate people's problems with mosquitoes
D. discussing various ways in which people come into contact with mosquitoes
E. suggesting how the breeding habits of mosquitoes create problems for people
2. Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?
A. A hypothesis is presented, weighed, and qualified, and then the modified hypothesis is
reaffirmed.
B. An argument is advanced, then it is refuted, and an alternative is suggested.
C. A claim is made, a supporting example is provided, and then a conclusion is offered.
D. Opposing views are presented, evaluated and then reconciled.
E. A problem is identified, a solution is proposed, and potential difficulties with the solution are
raised
3. Select a sentence in which a potential misinterpretation of the author's position is
addressed.

 Passage 192
In an experiment, a group of pregnant mice were each given food containing minute doses of 
the hormone BPA. A control group of pregnant mice were given no BPA. Offspring of mothers 
that had been given BPA were 10 percent bigger when weaned from their mothers than were 
offspring of mothers in the control group. Clearly, this result supports the hypothesis that the 
physical development of mice is significantly affected by prenatal exposure to BPA.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A. Prenatal exposure of mice to doses of BPA even smaller than those used in the experiment
would not have significantly affected the physical development of the mice.
B. At birth, there was no difference in size between offspring of mothers that had been given
BPA and offspring of mothers in the control group.
C. Postnatal exposure of mice to BPA before the mice are weaned has significant effects on
the physical development of the mice.
D. Exposure of a pregnant mouse to the doses of BPA used in the experiment does not
significantly enhance its ability nurse its offspring.
E. Significant differences in size between offspring of mothers that had been given BPA and
offspring of mothers in the control group persisted long after the offspring were weaned
Passage 193
In 1995, after an absence of nearly 70 years, wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone 
National Park. During the wolf-free era, heavy browsing of aspen trees by elk populations 
spelled doom not only for trees themselves but for a host of other creatures dependent on 
them, such as beavers, whose population in Yellowstone crashed after wolves were removed. 
Without beavers to create ponds, wetland ecosystems--aquatic plants, amphibians, birds--
were devastated. When wolves returned, grazers and browsers resumed normal patterns of 
behaviors, preferring safer, open areas over the dense cover and streamsides where 
carnivores can lurk. Keeping elk wary and on the move, wolves gave aspen and other young 
trees the opportunity to grow and become reestablished.
1. The passage asserts which of the following about beaver populations in Yellowstone?
A. They have rebounded since the reintroduction of wolves.
B. They were adversely affected by the feeding habits of elk population.
C. They increased during the period when wolves disappeared from the park.
D. They have historically had an adverse effect on the park's wetland ecosystems.
E. They are essential to the health of the park's aspen trees.
2. The author would most likely agree with which of the following claims about the
reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone?
A. It indirectly harmed some of the park's amphibian habitats
B. It reduced the number of elk feeding along streamsides
C. It led to greater species diversity among the park's grazers and browsers.
D. It significantly increased competition for food among the park's carnivores.
E. It fostered the resurgence of tree species that once flourished in the park's open areas.

 Passage 194
Unlike herbivores and omnivores, predators have traditionally been thought not to balance 
nutrient intake because of the assumption that animal tissue as a food source varies little and 
is nutritionally balanced. But chemical analysis of invertebrate prey reveals remarkable 
variation in nutrient composition among species; even within species, nutrient composition 
may vary considerably. Greenstone suggested that predators may select food items according 
to their nutrient contents. Jensen et al (2011) have shown experimentally that even sit-and-
wait invertebrate predators with limited mobility can work to address nutrient deficiencies. The 
wolf spider, for instance, has been shown to regulate nutrient intake by extracting more dry 
mass from a prey item if it contains a higher proportion of a nutrient that was deficient in the 
previous prey.
1. The passage supplies information for answering which of the following questions?
A. Do invertebrate predators with full mobility address nutrient needs in the same fashion as
sit-and-wait invertebrate predators with limited mobility?
B. Why would there be a considerable variation in nutrient composition within prey of a given
species?
C. Is all of the nutrient content of invertebrate prey contained in the dry mass?
D. What would a wolf spider do if a fly it was eating contained a higher proportion of a certain
nutrient than was present in the spider’s recent prey?
E. How is a wolf spider able to determine that some prey it is eating contains a higher
proportion of a nutrient that was deficient in the previous prey?
2. Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage as a whole?
A. A phenomenon is described, and an interpretation is offered.
B. A claim is made, and the corroborating evidence is evaluated.
C. A hypothesis is presented and undermined by recent findings.
D. A contrast is noted and shown to be specious based on recent findings.
E. A series of assumptions is presented and shown to be based on sound reasoning.

 Passage 195
Wild Diana monkeys are preyed upon by leopards and chimpanzees. These two predators 
differ in their hunting tactics and Diana monkeys use two distinct antipredator strategies to 
defend themselves. After detecting a leopard, Diana monkeys respond by giving loud, 
conspicuous alarm calls that function both to warn others and to signal to the predator that it 
has been detected. Leopards tend to leave the area once they have been discovered. In 
contrast, upon detecting a chimpanzee, male Diana monkeys do not vocalize at all, while 
females give only a few quiet alarm calls and flee quickly to hide in the forest canopy, 
chimpanzees have sophisticated climbing skills that would allow them to pursue monkeys, 
even in the high strata of the forest canopy.
Choosing an antipredator strategy appropriate to chimpanzees is complicated for Diana 
monkeys by the fact that chimpanzees themselves also fall prey to leopards. When 
encountering a leopard, chimpanzees give loud, conspicuous alarm calls. To escape 
successfully from leopards and chimpanzees, therefore, Diana monkeys must distinguish 
between, and respond differently to, chimpanzees alarm calls and chimpanzee vocalizations 
simply signal the presence of a leopard and should elicit the monkeys’ loud, conspicuous 
alarm calls.
To investigate Diana monkeys’ understanding of such cause-effect relationships involving 
predators, Zuberbuhler examined the monkeys’ responses to chimpanzee vocalizations in two 
different types of experiments. In the first, he played tape recording of either chimpanzees’ 
alarm calls or their social vocalizations and noted the monkeys’ responses. Diana monkeys 
differed in their response to chimpanzees’ alarm calls. In some groups, monkeys behaved as if 
they recognized that these alarm calls signaled the potential presence of a leopard: they 
responded to chimpanzees’ leopard alarm calls by giving leopard alarm calls themselves, in 
contrast to their normal response to the presence of chimpanzees. Groups of monkeys living 
in the core area of the resident chimpanzee community were more likely to behave in this way 
than were peripheral groups.
In the second set of experiments, Zuberbuhler played leopard growls to Diana monkeys shortly 
after exposing them to recording of either chimpanzees’ alarm calls or their social 
vocalizations. After first hearing chimpanzees’ alarm calls, some monkeys failed to respond to 
the subsequent recording of leopard growls, even though this stimulus normally elicited a 
strong vocal response. These monkeys behaved exactly like the Diana monkeys in a 
comparison group, who also gave many leopard alarm calls to an initial recording of leopard 
growls but no longer called to the second recording of leopard growls five minutes later. This 
similarity in behavior suggests that these monkeys had some knowledge of the causal factors 
underlying the production of chimpanzees’ alarm calls.
1. According to the passage, the behavior of male and female Diana monkeys differs in that
female Diana monkeys
A. give alarm calls upon detecting a chimpanzee
B. hide in the forest canopy upon detecting a leopard
C. give loud alarm calls in response to chimpanzees’ alarm calls
D. give loud, conspicuous alarm calls upon detecting a leopard
E. respond differently to the presence of leopards than they do to the presence of
chimpanzees
201


2. It can be inferred that the purpose of the highlighted “loud, conspicuous alarm calls” is in
part to
A. cause the chimpanzees to leave the areas
B. warn other monkeys of the presence of the chimpanzees
C. enable chimpanzees to flee quietly from the leopard
D. signal to the chimpanzees that they have been detected
E. signal to the leopard that it has been detected by the monkeys
3. The author mentions the “sophisticated climbing skills” of chimpanzees most likely in order
to present information that helps to
A. explain why chimpanzees are less vulnerable to predation by leopards than are Diana
monkeys
B. question the hypothesis that Diana monkeys hide in the forest canopy to defend themselves
from chimpanzees
C. argue that the antipredator strategies Diana monkeys use to defend themselves against
chimpanzees
D. suggest a possible reason for chimpanzees’ and Diana monkeys’ use of similar antipredator
strategies to defend themselves against leopards

 Passage 196
Matisse's art, with its spectacular immediacy and its mysterious depths, poses confounding 
problems for analysis. When Hilary Spurling writes of The Piano Lesson that “the picture can 
not be confined to any single source or meaning,” she might be writing of any of Matisse’s 
works. Picasso’s themes, with their collage of traditional signs and symbols, are far more 
susceptible to conventional iconographic analysis than anything in Matisse. Similarly, the 
cubism of Picasso and Braque, while rejecting traditional perspective, can nevertheless be 
studied as an inversion of traditional norms, using the same tools that one uses to study those 
norms. But the solutions that Matisse arrives at are always idiosyncratic and tend to be 
unrelated to any system of ideas. Intuition is his only system. 
1. The passage suggests which of the following about Braque’s cubism?
A. It lends itself more readily to systematic analysis than does Matisse’s work.
B. It is more radical in terms of form than most paintings by Matisse.
C. It was influenced by Matisse’s idiosyncratic and intuitive approach.
D. It can not be confined to any single source or meaning.
E. It is overly dependent on traditional signs and symbols.
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
2. The passage identifies which of the following as a reason that Matisse’s art can confound
analysis?
A. Traditional analytical tools are not well suited to Matisse’s art.
B. Matisse's art is marked by a freedom from systematic influence.
C. The norms that Picasso and Braque rejected were not ones that Matisse rejected.

 Passage 197
Attempts to identify New Guinea’s hunter-gatherers face the well-known difficulty of defining 
what constitutes a hunter-gatherer group. According to the common definition, hunter-
gatherers are those who subsist by hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants. Yet those 
who subsist by hunting wild animals and gathering wild issue of what constitutes “wild” The 
very presence on a landscape of humans who are consumers affects food resources, blurring 
the lines between wild and domesticated and, hence, between hunting and pastoralism and 
between gathering and cultivation. Moreover, it is unclear how groups should be classified that 
are hunter-gatherers in their procurement strategies but that make use of pastoralism and 
cultivation in their consumption patterns---subsisting, for example, by trading wild foods to 
neighbors in return for domesticated crops.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. suggest that there are not as many hunter-gatherers in New Guinea as is commonly
thought
B. explain why identifying New Guinea’s hunter-gatherers is not a straightforward process
C. point to certain difficulties in establishing what constitutes a wild plant and a wild animal
D. establish new, more relevant criteria for what constitutes a hunter-gatherer group
E. discuss the implications of an inappropriate definition of pastoralism
2. Replacement of the word “common” with which of the following results in the least change in
meaning to the passage?
A. trite
B. mutual
C. unexceptional
D. collective
E. conventional

 Passage 198 
Only since the late 1960s have literary scholars attempted to establish an accurate and 
systematic literary history of women novelists. Many previous histories suffered from “Great 
Traditionalism,” an approach that, by limiting itself to a group of women writers termed 
“great,” ignored the diversity among women novelists. These histories excluded the minor 
novelists, who are the links in the chain that binds literary generations together, and who allow 
us to see the continuities in women’s writing. Given the distortions produced by this 
concentration on “great” writers, as well as the obviously problematic tendency of many literary 
scholars to apply stereotypes of femininity, it was not surprising that some literary scholars 
in the early 1960s evaded the important issue of women’s sexual identity entirely, focusing 
instead on the form and style of women’s writing. Such an approach, while insightful and very 
valuable, did not consider the crucial connections between women’s writing and changes in 
their legal and economic status.
1. According to the passage, some literary scholars in the early 1960s tended to do which of
the following in their considerations of women novelists’ works?
A. attack the traditional distinction between “great” women novelists and those women
novelists considered less important
B. consider sexual identity when evaluating the works of “great” women novelists but not the
works of minor women novelists
C. ignore the issue of the sexual identity of women novelists altogether
D. address issues of form and style more frequently when discussing “great” women novelists
than when discussing minor women novelists
E. apply more stringent stylistic standards when evaluating minor women writers than when
evaluating the group of women writers traditionally termed “great”
2. Information in the passage suggests that literary histories that adhere to “Great
Traditionalism” have which of the following flaws?
A. They overemphasize the issue of sexual identity in women’s writing.
B. They overemphasize the degree of continuity between literary generations.
C. They do not help to explain the connections between different generations of women
novelists.
D. They denigrate the achievements of “great” female novelists in comparison with those of
male novelists.
E. They do not incorporate the insights of literary histories produced before the late 1960s.
3. The attitude of the author of the passage toward the approach taken toward women
novelists by “some literary scholars in the early 1960s” can best be described as
A. disinterested and aloof
B. condescending and dismissive
C. respectful but critical
D. favorable but brusque
E. interested but puzzled

 Passage 199
The accepted model of planetary formation holds that Jupiter-sized planets could only form in 
orbits much farther from their parent star than Earth is from the Sun. Recently, astronomers 
have detected planets, though as large a Jupiter, have orbits around stars older than the Sun 
that are much closer to those stars than Earth’s orbit is to the Sun. Nonetheless, most 
astronomers continue to regard the accepted model as correct.
Which of the following, if true, provides astronomers with the strongest support for continuing 
to regard the accepted model of planetary formation as correct, despite the new discoveries?
A. The instruments used to detect planets orbiting other stars are incapable of detecting
planets that are smaller than Jupiter.
B. Only a small fraction of the stars likely to have planets have been examined so far
C. After being formed, planets as small as Earth might be attracted to large planets, eventually
becoming their satellites.
D. There is no known reason why older stars would tend to be more likely than younger stars
to have planets
E. Planets tend to drawn into closer orbits of their parent star as time passes.
Passage 200
What causes size variation in bumblebee workers? In pollen storing species larvae develop in 
individual nest cells and are fed directly by adults. Thus, adults probably determine the size 
attained by each larva. Bumblebee larval cells are not as neatly organized as are those of 
honeybees, and larvae at the periphery of the brood may receive less care than a ten-fold 
variation in worker mass results from the accidental neglect of some larvae. Given that larvae 
are reared in a controlled environment by specialized nest workers, it seems more likely that 
this size variation has an adaptive function and that the colonies benefit from rearing workers 
of a range of sizes.
1. It can be inferred that the author of the passage considers the variation in size of
bumblebee workers to be
A. serendipitous
B. unpredictable
C. inconsequential
D. advantageous
E. unfortunate
2. In the context in which it appears, “determine” most nearly means
A. order
B. discover
C. control
D. decipher
E. terminate

 passage 201
Pueblo Bonito, the most impressive of the “great houses” at the prehistoric Chaco Canyon site in 
New Mexico, comprised over 600 rooms and 4 to 5 stories. Traditional interpretations have viewed 
the great houses as almost entirely residential, with some archaeologists estimating the population 
of Pueblo Bonito at 1,200. But Windes recently challenged this view by pointing out the paucity of 
hearths recorded during the excavation of Pueblo Bonito, which revealed only 3 upper-story 
hearths, in contrast to 59 ground-ﬂoor hearths: habituation rooms would have required hearths for 
cooking and heat. It is possible, however, that the collapse of upper-story ﬂoors disturbed evidence 
of upper-story hearths to such an extent that they were not revealed by early excavations such as 
those conducted by Pepper’s ﬁeld crews in the 1890s and Judd’s in the 1920s. Additionally, 
reliance on room features for early population estimates is complicated by the Chacoan’s later 
remodeling, especially given Judd’s disinclination to destroy later structures and features to expose 
earlier ones. The failure of early excavations to strip off intact ﬂoors may have concealed evidence 
of hearths in upper-story rooms. 
1. The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements
about Windes’ argument? 
A. It relies on evidence that is irrelevant to the examination of structures as large as Pueblo Bonito.
B. It fails to acknowledge crucial evidence from great houses other than Pueblo Bonito.
C. It fails to incorporate crucial evidence from excavations before the 1920s.
D. It is based on a false notion about the signiﬁcance of hearths. 
E. It is based on evidence that may be incomplete.
2. It can be inferred from the passage that Windes would be most likely to agree with which of the
following statements about room usage in Pueblo Bonito? 
A. Upper-story rooms were rarely used as storage areas. 
B. Rooms that were remodeled were most likely to have been residential rooms.
C. The majority of residential rooms were located on the ground ﬂoor. 
D. Early excavations of Pueblo Bonito disturbed much of the evidence indication room usage. 
E. Upper-story rooms with hearths were probably used for different purposes than were lower story
rooms with hearths.
3. Which of the following can be inferred about the excavation work performed by Judd’s ﬁeld
crew?
A. It did not unearth many room features that existed prior to Chacoan remodeling. 
B. It did not unearth any evidence of upper-story hearths. 
C. It revealed only habitation rooms.
D. It resulted in the collapse of some room features and upper-story ﬂoors.
E. It conﬁrmed traditional population estimates for Pueblo Bonito.

 passage 202
Since the 1970s, archaeological sites in China’s Yangtze River region have yielded evidence of 
sophisticated rice-farming societies that predate signs of rice cultivation elsewhere in East Asia by 
a thousand years. Before this evidence was discovered, it had generally been assumed that rice 
farming began farther to the south. This scenario was based both on the geographic range of wild 
or free-living rice, which was not thought to extend as far north as the Yangtze, and on 
archaeological records of very early domestic rice from Southeast Asia and India (now known to be 
not so old as ﬁrst reported). Proponents of the southern-origin theory point out that early rice-
farming societies along the Yangtze were already highly developed and that evidence for the ﬁrst 
stage of rice cultivation is missing. They argue that the ﬁrst hunter-gatherers to develop rice 
agriculture must have done so in this southern zone, within the apparent present-day geographic 
range of wild rice. 
Yet while most strands of wild rice reported in a 1984 survey were concentrated to the south of the 
Yangtze drainage, two northern outlier populations were also discovered in provinces along the 
middle and lower Yangtze, evidence that the Yangtze wetlands may fall within both the present-day 
and the historical geographic ranges of rice’s wild ancestor. 
1. Which of the following, if true, would most clearly undermine the conclusion that the author
makes based on the 1984 survey? 
A. Areas south of the Yangtze basin currently have less wild-rice habitat than they once did. 
B. Surveys since 1984 have shown wild rice populations along the upper Yangtze as well as along
the middle and lower Yangtze.
C. The populations of wild rice along the Yangtze represent strains of wild rice that migrated to the
north relatively recently. 
D. Early rice-farming societies along the Yangtze were not as highly developed as archaeologists
once thought. 
E. In East Asia, the historical geographic range of wild rice was more extensive than the present-
day geographic range is.
2. Based on the passage, skeptics of the idea that rice cultivation began in the Yangtze River
region pointed to which of the following for support? 
A. lack of evidence supporting the existence of rice-farming societies along the Yangtze at an early
date
B. lack of evidence regarding the initial stages of rice cultivation in the Yangtze region 
C. recent discoveries pertaining to the historical geographic range of rice's wild ancestor 
D. new information regarding the dates of very early domestic rice from Southeast Asia 
E. new theories pertaining to how hunter-gatherers ﬁrst developed rice agriculture in East Asia
3. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the “southern-origin theory?” 
A. The theory is based on an unconventional understanding of how hunter-gatherers ﬁrst
developed rice agriculture. 
B. The theory fails to take into account the apparent fact that evidence for the ﬁrst stage of rice
cultivation in the north is missing. 
C. The theory was developed primarily in response to a 1984 survey of wild rice's geographic
range.
D. Reassessment of the dates of some archaeological evidence has undermined support for the
theory.
E. Evidence of sophisticated rice-farming societies in the Yangtze region provides support for the
theory.

 passage 203
The disappearance of Steller’s sea cow from the Bering and Copper islands by 1768 has long 
been blamed on intensive hunting. But its disappearance took only 28 years from the time Steller 
ﬁrst described the species, a remarkably short time for hunting alone to depopulate the islands, 
especially given the large populations initially reported. However, by 1750, hunters had also 
targeted nearby sea otter populations. Fewer otters would have allowed sea urchin populations on 
which the otters preyed to expand and the urchins’ grazing pressure on kelp forests to increase. 
Sea cows were totally dependent on kelp for food, and within a decade of the onset of otter 
hunting. Steller noted that the islands’ sea cows appeared malnourished. 
1. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about kelp forests in the Bering and
Copper is lands between 1750 and 1768? 
A. They were reduced signiﬁcantly. 
B. They disappeared entirely from the region.
C. They were the primary food source for sea otters.
D. They were harvested in record numbers by humans.
E. They increased pressure on sea urchin populations.
2. According to the passage, it is likely that during the mid-1700s, sea urchin populations near the
Bering and Copper islands 
A. were diminished by sea cow predation 
B. experienced substantial increases
C. migrated to waters with more plentiful food supplies
D. were reduced by the pressures of hunting 
E. appeared to be malnourished

 passage 204
The conventional story of the American colonists’ revolt against Britain holds that the founders of 
the United States established a form of government that, although ﬂawed by its leaders’ failure to 
recognize the rights of women and African Americans, was nevertheless unsurpassed in its 
promise of human equality. There is, however, a cynical counterstory, which details the founders’ 
lust for property and their crass manipulation of the colonial population, and characterizes leaders 
like Thomas Jefferson as having wielded promises of equality merely as deceptive tools, discarded 
once the Revolution was won, and as having deliberately allowed the United States to be governed 
by a small, powerful elite. Both of these stories assume that a homogeneous revolutionary 
leadership employed an equally homogeneous egalitarian discourse to justify its actions. Even a 
cursory examination of the public discourse from the period, however, makes it clear that the 
leadership was anything but homogeneous in its discourse, and that overall the relative 
emphasis placed on the words “liberty” and “property” was far greater than that placed on 
“equality”. 
1. The author of the passage implies that an examination of public discourse from the
Revolutionary period shows that the 
A. revolutionary leadership was homogeneous in its attempts to justify its actions. 
B. revolutionary leaders were more concerned with liberty and property than with equality.
C. revolutionary leaders initially desired to provide freedom and wealth for all colonial citizens.
D. colonial population was cynically manipulated into supporting the revolutionary leadership. 
E. conventional story that the revolutionary leadership ignored the rights of women and African
Americans is wrong.
2. According to the passage, which of the following best summarizes the primary difference
between two accounts of the American Revolution? 
A. The ﬁrst account acknowledges the failure of the revolutionary leaders to recognize the rights of
women and African Americans, while the second does not address the issue of equal rights.
B. The ﬁrst account claims that the government succeeded in its goal of providing equal rights for
all of the colonists, while the second reports that the new nation was governed by a small, powerful
elite.
C. The ﬁrst account employs traditional historical scholarship and sources, while the second
reports that new nation was governed by a small, powerful elite.
D. The ﬁrst account suggests that the revolutionary leaders sincerely promised equality, while the
second reports that the leaders’ false promises of equality were a deceptive means of gaining
colonists’ support. 
E. The ﬁrst account does not address the issue of public discourse, while the second describes
how public discourse shaped the outcome of the Revolutionary War.
3. A subsequent research uncovered the following materials, which of them would most clearly call
into question the position taken by the author in the highlighted portion
A. A speech given by Thomas Jefferson during the Revolutionary War in which he speaks about
the Revolution’s goal of providing all citizens with equal access to property. 
B. Written statements by British leaders of the Revolutionary period revealing that the British
monarchy continually warned its colonial subjects that the revolutionary leaders were making false
promises of liberty and equality in order to gain support. 
C. Unpublished essays by major revolutionary leaders contradicting one another with regard to the
Revolution’s position on human equality. 
D. The diaries of revolutionary leaders revealing that the goals of the revolution were deﬁned
differently by different people and the leaders of the new government embraced many different
ideals and principles. 
E. A series of leaﬂets written by various revolutionary leaders and distributed widely among the
colonial population detailing the Revolution’s consistent dedication to the principles of human
equality.

 passage 205
Zora Neale Hurston's 1942 autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, has received some of the most 
negative criticism of any of Hurston’s books. Among critics’ complaints—some from Hurston's 
warmest admirers—is the work’s fragmentary nature, a nature which, while presented in other 
Hurston texts, including the universally acclaimed novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, is 
particularly conspicuous in Dust Tracks. The complaints about Dust Tracks are valid if one insists 
on the cardinal conventions of autobiography: traditional autobiographical structure and formal 
organization, and a focused projection of the autobiographical persona. But Dust Tracks portrays a 
persona that resists reduction to a coherent unity—a person of many moods who is in tension with 
the world in which she moves. In order to correspond better to this persona, Dust Tracks focuses 
on the fragmented life of Hurston’s imagination: the psychological dynamics of her family, 
community stories, and characters of friends. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is 
A. explain why Dust Tracks has been less well received than other similarly structured works by
Hurston. 
B. argue that a supposed deﬁciency in Dust Tracks actually contributes to the work’s presentation
of its subject. 
C. compare the critical reaction to Dust Tracks with the critical reaction to Their Eyes Were
Watching God. 
D. point out speciﬁc similarities between the structure of Dust Tracks and the structure of Hurston’s
other works. 
E. suggest that some critics’ evaluations of Dust Tracks is inﬂuenced by their rejection of certain
conventions of autobiography.
2. The author of the passage suggests that critics’ complaints about the structure of Dust Tracks
are
A. not valid, because Dust Tracks should not be judged by the standards of conventional
autobiography. 
B. unjustiﬁed, because they have not been directed at other Hurston texts that are similarly
structured.
C. justiﬁed, given the extent to which Dust Tracks is autobiographical.
D. inexplicable, given the critical response to Their Eyes Were Watching God. 
E. compelling, because Huston’s warmest admirers have complained the most strenuously.
3. Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage? 
A. A situation is presented and an explanation of how that situation developed is offered. 
B. Two opposing points of view are contrasted and their relative merits are evaluated. 
C. An orthodox view is discussed, a challenge to it is analyzed, and the original view is afﬁrmed.
D. A point of view is described and an analysis challenging that point of view follows. 
E. A dispute is analyzed and several points of agreement between the two sides are identiﬁed.

 passage 206
African American painter Malvin Gray Johnson (1896-1934) grew up in urban environments, 
including New York City, but in 1934 visited and painted scenes from the small town of Brightwood, 
Virginia. Some critics have celebrate the Brightwood paintings, which depict a vibrant natural 
landscape and close-knit Black community, as Johnson’s discovery of an “authentic” African 
American life in the rural South. This view, which reﬂects a common tendency to regard African 
American artists’ imagery as unmediated documentation of direct experience, overlooks Johnson’s 
interpretive thinking. In truth, Johnson’s conceptualization of the South was largely formed before 
he left New York, where he had studied the French expressionist Paul Cézanne. Johnson’s 
Brightwood paintings reﬂect Cézanne’s stylistic inﬂuence and tendency to present rural life 
as an idyllic alternative to modern industrialism. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to 
A. contest a particular interpretation of Johnson’s Brightwood paintings 
B. compare Johnson’s Brightwood paintings to French Expressionist art 
C. use information about Johnson’s historical context to illuminate the social signiﬁcance of his
Brightwood paintings 
D. explain why the work of African American painters is sometimes misunderstood 
E. call attention to an aspect of Johnson’s technique that has been largely overlooked
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. The highlighted sentence has which of the following functions in the passage? 
A. It expands upon a point made in the previous sentence. 
B. It helps explain a common tendency described earlier in the passage 
C. It identiﬁes a way in which Johnson sought to differentiate his work from that of other artists.
passage 207
The ability to recognize speciﬁc individuals has profound implications for the evolution of complex 
social behaviors such as reciprocal altruism. Many researchers assumed that recognition of 
individuals, a phenomenon predominantly observed in laboratory studies of ﬁsh, might also operate 
extensively in free-ranging ﬁsh populations, where it could underpin these complex interactions. In 
fact, evidence of individual recognition in free-ranging ﬁsh populations is equivocal. The possibility 
exists that for many species, individual recognition observed in the laboratory might be an artifact 
of experimental designs, which enforce prolonged interaction between individuals and which 
prevent the diluting effects on social structure of immigration into and emigration from the shoal, 
factors that in nature would erode group stability and prevent the learning of individual identities. 
1. Click on the sentence in the passage that speculates about the effect of human intervention on
an observation.
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. The author would likely agree with which of the following statements about the prevalence of
speciﬁc individual recognition that occurred in ﬁsh in the laboratory studies discussed? 
A. It suggests that the laboratory studies were well designed to simulate the natural habitats of the
ﬁsh studied. 
B. It might have been inﬂated due to continued exposure to the same individuals. 
C. It does not provide reliable evidence about the behavior of free ranging ﬁsh.

 passage 208
Hard Times, Charles Dickens’ shortest novel, was written and published in 1854. Despite the 
sensational success of its two immediate predecessors, David Copperﬁeld and Bleak House, and 
its immediate successors, Little Dorritt and A Tale of Two Cities, Hard Times seems to have been 
Dickens’ least popular novel during his own lifetime and subsequently. One critic speculated that 
editorial cuts imposed on the novel for serialization were responsible. However, as Jane Jacobs 
points out, Hard Times was serialized in Household Words, a periodical that Dickens not only 
founded but edited. Part of the reason for the book’s relative unpopularity may have been its 
despairing message, its depiction of pervasive emptiness in almost everything life has to offer, from 
marriage and family to success and community. Jacobs also suggests that the book’s structure 
may have played a role: action is slow and scant throughout, and descriptions and conversations 
during the ﬁrst two thirds of the book are repetitious. While the book’s tone changes abruptly in the 
last section, when Dickens, the master storyteller, jogs his characters into life by enmeshing them 
in convoluted coils of plot, the reader must ﬁrst endure the tedious way in which Dickens 
establishes the novel’s settings and characters. 
1. The passage suggests which of the following about the last section of Hard Times?
A. The last section compares unfavorably with the ﬁrst part of the book in terms of literary quality. 
B. In the last section the settings are presented in a more tedious fashion than is the case in other
Dickens’ works mentioned in the passage. 
C. In the last section the characters tend to be more optimistic than they are in the ﬁrst part of the
book D. The last section is atypical of Dickens’ general storytelling style. 
E. The last section would be more likely to appeal to readers than would the ﬁrst part of the book.
2. The author of the passage mentions David copperﬁeld, Bleak House, Little Dorritt, and A Tale of
Two Cities most likely in order to 
A. provide a context that helps to explain the public and critical reaction to Hard Times 
B. present examples of other works by Dickens that were not initially commercially successful
C. suggest that Hard Times’ lack of popularity was an anomaly during this period in Dickens’ career
D. imply that the quality of Dickens’ writing improved over time 
E. question the idea that the novels immediately preceding and following Hard Times were
extraordinarily successful
3. Each of the following is mentioned in the passage as a possible reason for the relative
unpopularity of Hard Times EXCEPT for the 
A. repetitive conversations throughout most of the book 
B. novel’s depiction of marriage and family
C. novel’s despairing message 
D. convoluted plot development in the last part of the book
E. way that the novel establishes its characters
213


 passage 209
Was resource intensiﬁcation—an increase in labor and time devoted to subsistence activities in 
order to increase food yields—by Dorset Paleo-Eskimos and Recent Indians on the island of 
Newfoundland simply a response to population pressure? Not exactly. On Newfoundland, 
population pressure did not result from a steadily growing resident population but, rather, from the 
arrival and lingering presence of new and signiﬁcantly different populations. Newfoundland’s 
hunter-gatherer populations—both resident and newcomer—adjusted to the presence of other 
populations through niche differentiation. Building on a tradition that emphasized marine resources, 
Dorset Paleo-Eskimos intensiﬁed their harvest of seals in response to the arrival of Recent Indians 
in the ﬁrst few centuries A.D. Recent Indians who were more familiar with broad-based, 
interior-maritime adaptation, intensiﬁed this strategy to cope with the Dorset. 
1. According to the passage, which of the following resulted from the arrival of the Recent Indians?
A. The Dorset Paleo-Eskimos were forced to compete with the Recent Indians for a limited supply
of seals. 
B. The Dorset Paleo-Eskimos spent more time harvesting seals than they had in the past. 
C. The Dorset Paleo-Eskimos increased the amount of labor and time devoted to defending their
territory. 
D. The Dorset Paleo-Eskimos began to adopt new subsistence strategies they learned from the
Recent Indians. 
E. The previously steady growth of the Dorset Paleo-Eskimo population came to a halt.
2. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context of
the passage as a whole? 
A. It points out a ﬂaw in a theory discussed earlier in the passage. 
B. It demonstrates the need for additional research on a phenomenon mentioned earlier in the
passage.
C. It underscores the importance of a trait mentioned earlier in the passage.
D. It supports an assertion made earlier in the passage. 
E. It questions the evidence for a tradition mentioned earlier in the passage.

 passage 210
Having a larger assortment to choose from increases consumers’ expectations about matching 
their preferences. The heightened expectations seem logical, since assortments containing more 
or more varied items should increase the degree to which preferences can be matched. In practice, 
however, as assortment size increases, the degree to which consumers realize better preference 
matches often rises relatively little. Larger assortments may not actually offer more variety, the 
market may simply not supply an envisioned offering, or in the absence of sophisticated search 
tools, consumers may miss a better preference match even if it is available. Therefore, larger 
assortments can increase the likelihood that expectations will not be met, leaving consumers 
less satisﬁed with options chosen from larger rather than smaller assortments. 
1. In the highlighted portion of the passage, the author assumes that 
A. consumers’ attitude toward the assortment of choices they are presented with depends almost
exclusively on the size of the range 
B. consumers who have clear preferences make their choices more quickly than those whose
preferences are relatively vague 
C. consumers’ anticipation of meeting speciﬁc expectations directly affects their satisfaction with a
selected option 
D. consumers presented with an assortment of choices often adjust the preferences they had
beforehand
E. consumers presented with a larger assortment of choices often make their decisions too quickly
2. Which of the following best describes the function of the ﬁrst sentence in the author’s argument
as a whole? 
A. It states a premise on which the author’s conclusion is based 
B. It provides information to support the inference made in the following sentence
C. It introduces a concept that the author proves is illogical 
D. It summarizes a position that the author proceeds to dispute 
E. It presents the phenomenon the argument is intended to explain
215


 passage 211
Founder mutations are a class of disease-causing genetic mutations, each derived from its own 
ancestral “founder” in whom the mutation originated. While most disease-causing mutated are 
found in humans at a rate of one in a few thousand to one in a few million people, founder mutation 
can occur at much higher rates. This apparent anomaly is partially explained by the fact that most 
founder mutations are recessive: only a person with copies of the affected gene from both parents 
becomes ill. Most people with only one copy of the gene—“carriers”—survive and pass the gene to 
offspring. Furthermore, the single copy of a founder mutation often confers a survival advantage on 
carriers. For example, the hereditary hemochromatosis mutation protects carriers from iron-
deﬁciency anemia because the mutated gene allows increased efﬁciency of iron absorption. 
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. The passage indicates which of the following about founder mutations? 
A. Carriers of founder mutation may receive certain beneﬁts from the mutated gene.
B. People who inherit founder mutations from both parents can become ill as a result.
C. Founder mutations are less likely than other mutations to be passed to offspring.
2. The author of the passage mentions the “hereditary hemochromatosis mutation” primarily in
order to illustrate 
A. the circumstances under which a founder mutation fails to cause a disease. 
B. how difﬁcult it is to predict the effects of founder mutations on carriers.
C. the difference between harmful founder mutation and those that are beneﬁcial.
D. how a single copy of a founder mutation can beneﬁt a carrier. 
E. a challenge to a particular theory about the transmission of founder mutations.
216


 passage 212
The recently announced discovery of the ﬁrst known planet orbiting a pulsar (the ultradense, 
pulsating remnant off the supernova explosion of a star) turned out to be based on faulty data. Had 
this discovery been conﬁrmed, theorists would have had difﬁculty accounting for the existence of 
such a planet. The supernova would certainly have destroyed any preexisting planets. This 
particular pulsar is relatively young, allowing little time for a new planet to have coalesced, and it 
rotates relatively slowly, implying that it has not interacted with any nearby star since the 
supernova. 
But newer evidence of a different pulsar with planets is more promising. This is a rapidly spurring 
“millisecond pulsar” thought to be a much older object that has pulled gaseous material from a 
stellar neighbor, causing its rotational speed to increase. Leftover, unconsumed gas around such a 
pulsar could, in theory, coalesce into planets. Or the pulsar’s radiation might have vaporized a 
companion star, providing new material for planetary formation. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to 
A. provide an example of the dangers of a recent discovery based on faulty data. 
B. illustrate the difﬁculty of explanation concerning a recent discovery 
C. assess the credibility of recent ﬁndings concerning the as yet unveriﬁed existence of a class of
objects. 
D. argue that a certain hypothesis fails to account for a seemingly contradictory phenomenon 
E. demonstrate how difﬁcult it might be to ﬁnd out the reality of a phenomenon
2. Which of the following best describe the organization of the passage? 
A. Two sets of research ﬁndings relating to similar phenomenon are mentioned, and the theoretical
implication of each are discussed. 
B. A theoretical explanation of a phenomenon is presented and rejected, and a more attractive
alternative is offered 
C. Two independent and divergent interpretations of a set of observational data are compared and
one is favored over the other 
D. An example of careless scientiﬁc research is introduced and contrasted with a more rigorous
analysis of the same material. 
E. The state of knowledge of an unexplainable phenomenon is outlined and an approach to further
investigation is recommended.
3. Which of the following can be inferred regarding the pulsar discussed in the ﬁrst paragraph? 
A. Theorists initially doubted its existence 
B. If its existence had been conﬁrmed, astronomers would and have turned their attention to the
pulsar discussed in the second paragraph. 
C. If the supernovas explosions that created it had been more powerful, the resulting radiation
would have preceded the subsequent formation of a planet. 
D. If it had interacted with a nearby star since the supernova explosion, it would rotate faster than it
does. 
E. Astronomers’ interest in it ultimately led to a new theory of planetary formation.
217


 passage 213
There have been numerous well-documented extinctions of indigenous species caused by the 
introduction of nonindigenous predators and pathogens. However, surprisingly few extinctions of 
indigenous species can be attributed to competition from introduced species. For example, during 
the past 400 years, 4,000 plant species have been introduced into North America, and these 
nonindigenous plants currently account for nearly 20 percent of North America’s plant species. Yet 
no evidence exists that any indigenous North American plant species became extinct as a result of 
competition from introduced plant species. The scarcity of documented extinctions caused by 
competition from new species could mean that such extinctions take longer to occur than scientists 
initially believed or, alternatively, that extinctions are rarely caused by competition from 
nonindigenous species. 
1. The passage is concerned primarily with 
A. Pointing out that a particular type of species extinction is rarely known to occur 
B. Proposing a possible explanation for conﬂicting data about a particular type of species extinction
C. Resolving a debate about the frequency of a particular type of species extinction 
D. Comparing two theories regarding possible causes of a particular type of species extinction 
E. Refuting a proposed explanation for the increasingly rare occurrence of a particular type of
species extinction
2. The author introduces statistics about North America’s nonindigenous plant species primarily in
order to 
A. undermine a proposed explanation for the absence of any evidence for the occurrence of a
particular phenomenon. 
B. contrast the effect of introduced plant species in North America with the effect that introduced
animal species have had. 
C. suggest that North America’s indigenous plants are a domain in which there has been ample
scope for a particular effect to have occurred. 
D. emphasize how much the ecology of North America has been affected over the past 400 years
by the introduction of nonindigenous species 
E. substantiate a claim about the overall effect that the introduction of nonindigenous species tends
to have on indigenous populations.
218


 passage 214 
Marine ecosystems certainly have less permanence than terrestrial ecosystems. Ashore, 
ecologists are not confronted with shifting ecological discontinuities, or with changes in the 
characteristic conditions of individual ecosystems, because, unless man intervenes, the tree line 
on a mountain or the passage between grassland and savannah remains approximately static over 
a human lifetime. It is only on the millennial scale that such boundaries migrate signiﬁcantly, or that 
characteristic regional ecosystems disappear. Urban sprawl, deforestation, overgrazing, and 
intensive agriculture are accomplishing in a few decades what nature cannily do in centuries, but 
that sad fact does not alter the argument. Although the human population explosion can produce 
pressures that rapidly shift ecological boundaries and modify ecosystems ashore, it is 
paradoxically more difﬁcult directly to modify the average locations of the ephemeral and shifting 
ecological boundaries of the sea. We can accomplish this only indirectly by atmospheric 
modiﬁcation, resulting in a changed global climate and a shifted ocean circulation. 
Indeed, if we are agreed that the regional characteristics of marine ecosystems are consequent on 
the characteristics of the physical environment, then we must assume that ecological conditions 
are as impermanent as the physical conditions themselves. And these, it is now well understood, 
are in continual ﬂux and state of change at all scales of variability. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to 
A. examine differences in the threats faced by marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
B. explain how human intervention has affected marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
C. discuss a distinguishing feature of marine ecosystems 
D. present a debate regarding the causes of marine ecosystem impermanence 
E. discuss certain consequences of marine ecosystem impermanence
2. The passage indicates which of the following about the “ecological boundaries of the sea?”
A. They have become increasingly sensitive to changes in global climate. 
B. They are not signiﬁcantly impacted by changes in Earth’s atmosphere. 
C. Their stability is essential to the health of marine ecosystems.
D. They are more closely tied to surrounding physical conditions than are analogous boundaries on
land
E. They are less susceptible to direct human intervention than are analogous boundaries on land.
219


 passage 215
W.E.B. Du Bois’ exhibit of African American history and culture at the 1900 Paris Exposition 
Universelle attracted the attention of a world of sociological scholarship whose value his work 
challenged. Du Bois believed that Spencerian sociologists failed in their attempts to gain greater 
understanding of human deeds because their work examined not deeds but theories and because 
they gathered data not to affect social progress but merely to theorize. In his exhibit, Du Bois 
sought to present cultural artifacts that would shift the focus of sociology from the construction of 
vast generalizations to the observation of particular, living individual elements of society and the 
working contributions of individual people to a vast functioning social structure. 
1. The passage implies that Du Bois attributed which of the following beliefs to Spencerian
sociologists? 
A. Theorizing is important to the understanding of human actions 
B. Vast generalizations have limited value.
C. Data gathering is a relatively unimportant part of sociological research. 
D. Sociology should focus on the living elements of society rather than cultural artifacts.
E. Particulars are more important than universals.
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. The passage implies that Du Bois believed which of the following statements about sociology?
A. It should contribute to the betterment of society. 
B. It should study what people actually do. 
C. It should focus on how existing social structures determine individual behavior.
3. It can be inferred from the passage that Du Bois believed which of the following statements
about the artifacts he included in his exhibit?
A. They tended to support an established view of African American history and culture.
B. They documented the contributions of particular African Americans to American social structure.
C. They were chosen to encourage Spencerian sociologists to form useful generalizations.
220


 passage 216
Favorable environments do not necessarily lead to the occurrence of plant cultivation. South China 
is warmer and moister than North China and the Yangtze Basin, with wild rice and highly abundant 
natural resources. Yet archaeological data indicate that cereal cultivation did not occur in this 
region until approximately 7,000 to 6,500 years ago. This cultivation was likely a result of cultural 
contact with and expansion from the Yangtze Basin. Clearly, environmental factors were important 
for the occurrence of cultivation in China, but were not the absolute determining factors. While 
incipient cultivation might occur in areas of relatively abundant resources, it may not occur in areas 
of very abundant resources, such as South China, where foraging might be a more efﬁcient way of 
life. 
1. The author implies which of the following about natural resources in South China prior to 6,500
years ago? 
A. Their abundance may have actually served to discourage the development of plant cultivation.
B. They were not as abundant as most archaeologists have maintained.
C. They led indirectly to cultural contact with peoples from the Yangtze Basin. 
D. Their importance has been downplayed by scholars studying the beginnings of plant cultivation
in South China. 
E. They had little inﬂuence on the types of plants that were eventually cultivated in South China.
2. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about plant cultivation in the Yangtze
Basin? 
A. It occurred in spite of an unfavorable climate. 
B. It occurred prior to 6,500 years ago.
C. It occurred somewhat later than it occurred in North China. 
D. It occurred largely because of the abundance of wild rice in the region.
E. It occurred as a result of cultural contact with South China.
221


 passage 217
Wildcats are improbable candidates for domestication. Like all felids [cats], wildcats are obligate 
carnivores, meaning they have a limited metabolic ability to digest anything except proteins. 
Wildcats live a solitary existence and defend exclusive territories, making them more attached to 
places than to people. Furthermore, cats do not perform directed tasks and their actual utility is 
debatable; even as mousers, in this latter role, terrier dogs and ferrets are preferable. 
Accordingly, there is little reason to believe an early agricultural community would have 
sought out and selected the wildcat as a house pet. Rather, the best inference is that wildcats 
exploiting human environments were simply tolerated by people and, over time and space, they 
gradually diverged from their “wild” relatives. 
1. The author would most likely agree that in early agricultural communities cats would have been
A. more tolerant than ferrets of contact with humans 
B. as incapable of performing directed tasks as ferrets 
C. less likely to be solitary than ferrets
D. less useful than terrier dogs at controlling rodents
E. more easily domesticated than terrier dogs
2. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context of
the passage as a whole 
A. It challenges a widely accepted theory presented in the passage. 
B. It explains a fact that has long puzzled researchers.
C. It draws a conclusion from evidence presented in the passage. 
D. It presents new facts in support of a hypothesis. 
E. It formulates a new hypothesis from evidence presented in the passage.
222


 passage 218
George Milner cites three primary problems with the labeling of Cahokia, the large archaeological 
site by the Mississippi River, as a state rather than a chiefdom. First, ﬁnds at Cahokia are 
essentially similar to ﬁnds at other Mississippian chiefdoms, except that the amount of earth moved 
in building the mounds at Cahokia was greater than elsewhere. Second, fewer people lived at 
Cahokia than is commonly estimated (Milner estimates that there were only a few thousand 
inhabitants, more common estimates are 10,000 or 20,000 inhabitants); therefore, extensive taxes, 
trade, and tribute were not necessary to support them. Finally, while there is evidence of extensive 
earth movement, craftwork, trade, and elite at Cahokia, this does not indicate that Cahokia was 
politically centralized, economically specialized, or aggressively expansionistic. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. underscore a characterization 
B. outline a challenge 
C. point out an ambiguity
D. discuss an oversimpliﬁcation
E. deﬁne a category
2. The passage implies that political centralization is a feature that 
A. has not historically tended to emerge in centers with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants
B. distinguished other Mississippian chiefdoms from Cahokia 
C. is considered characteristic of state but not of chiefdoms 
D. often results from aggressive expansionism and economic specialization 
E. has historically been necessary for extensive trade to occur
223


 passage 219
Ecologists had assumed that trees in the consistently warm tropics grew at a slow but steady rate, 
unvarying from year to year. However, a study at La Selva, Costa Rica, showed that trees grew 
less in hotter years and more in cooler ones: between 1984 and 2000, dramatic differences 
occurred in the six species of trees studies, with trees adding twice as much wood in some cooler 
years as they did in the scorching El Nino year of 1997-1998. Because tree growth is an index of 
the balance between photosynthesis, in which trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the 
atmosphere and release oxygen, and respiration, in which the opposite occurs, the La Selva data 
were the ﬁrst hint that rapidly rising global temperatures, driven by human-generated emissions of 
CO2, may be pushing tropical forests to release more CO2, thereby intensifying global warming. 
This raised serious questions about a popular theory that tropical forests act as a sponge, soaking 
up much of the excess CO2 that humans pump into the atmosphere. The La Selva data are 
consistent with a model of global CO2 ﬂux developed by Keeling, who concluded that the amount 
of CO2 taken up in tropical landmasses rose in cooler years and fell in hotter ones, accounting for 
year-to-year changes in the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to 
A. present additional evidence to support a popular theory 
B. show the underlying similarities of two seemingly contradictory theories
C. point out the implications of a particular study for two related theories
D. provide an alternative explanation for a well-documented phenomenon
E. reconcile two competing theories that explain a phenomenon
2. The passage supports which of the following statements about the trees in the La Selva study? 
A. During the El Nino year, they added considerably less wood than they did in cooler years during
the period of 1984-2000. 
B. During the El Nino year, they typically had higher rates of photosynthesis than they did in other
years during the period of 1984-2000. 
C. During the El Nino year, they released considerably more oxygen than they did in cooler years
during the period of 1984-2000. 
D. During the El Nino year, they took up considerably more CO2 than they did in cooler years
during the period of 1984-2000. 
E. The amount of CO2 that they absorbed remained constant throughout the entire period of 1984-
2000.
3. The passage suggests that as temperatures rise, trees in the tropical regions
A. continue to grow at a slow but steady rate 
B. grow less and intensify photosynthesis 
C. emit more CO2 and oxygen
D. increase overall respiration and decrease overall photosynthesis
E. grow more and absorb more CO2

 passage 220
In the 2,000-year period immediately before European contact, many native groups of the Northern 
Plains of North America specialized in big-game hunting, subsisting primarily on bison. Bison 
routinely became fat-depleted in the spring, reducing their nutritional value, yet these groups did 
not supplement their diets with the nutritious, fat-rich ﬁsh that were abundantly available. Malainey 
et al. ﬁnd a possible explanation in late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth century accounts from 
three frontiersmen who had adapted to lean-meat diets during extended periods in the plains. Each 
had an opportunity to consume ﬁsh after extended meat dependence and upon eating it, became 
weak and ill. Malainey notes that prolonged lean meat dependence renders the body incapable of 
digesting lipids (fats), perhaps explaining native hunters’ ﬁsh avoidance. 
1. The author of the passage mentions accounts from three white frontiersmen primarily in order to 
A. show how the frontiersmen’s dietary choices were inﬂuenced by the native groups with whom
they came into contact. 
B. suggest that these frontiersmen had not adapted well to a diet composed primarily of lean meat. 
C. indicate what kind of diet was habitually followed by native big-game hunters of the Northern
Plains. 
D. identify evidence for a hypothesis regarding native hunters’ ﬁsh avoidance. 
E. call into question an assumption about the effects of ﬁsh consumption on people who have
adapted to a lean-meat diet.
2. Select the sentence that describes the phenomenon that the passage is concerned with ﬁnding
an explanation for.
passage 221
Migratory songbirds breeding in Eurasia’s temperate forests depend on a summer ﬂush of insects, 
particularly caterpillars, to feed themselves and their offspring. In some places, these caterpillars 
are emerging earlier in responses to rising global temperatures. In theory, the songbirds could 
simply push up their departure from their winter quarters to catch the earlier ﬂush of insect 
prey. If, however, the birds rely on a ﬁxed cue such as increasing day length to begin ﬂying north, 
they may be unable to adjust the timing of their migration. Precisely this disruption in the 
emergence of insects relative to the timing of songbird migration has been identiﬁed as the cause 
of a signiﬁcant decline in populations of pied ﬂycatchers in the Netherlands. 
1. The primary function of the highlighted sentence is to
A. refute the legitimacy of an earlier claim. 
B. hypothesize about a response to a particular situation.
C. point out a distinction between two theories.
D. present an explanation for a shifting environment.
E. illustrate a problem by providing an example.
2. According to the passage, populations of insects preyed upon by pied ﬂycatchers. 
A. are ﬁnding less food as temperatures rise in the Eurasian forests that they inhabit 
B. are endangered because of global warming 
C. have recently experienced changes in the timing of their life cycles relative to the calendar
D. have recently begun inhabiting cooler climates largely unfrequented by pied ﬂycatchers.
E. have increased signiﬁcantly because of lack of predation.
225


 passage 222
Widespread climate change challenges traditional notions that preserving speciﬁc chunks of land is 
an adequate way to protect endangered species. Commitment to particular places has taken 
conservation a long way, but it works only when the climate is relatively stable. When climate 
change rather than degraded habitat threatens a species’ survival in a particular location, moving 
the species to new locales might become one way of preserving it. Some ecologists argue that 
such assisted migration is simply a way to mimic the natural process of dispersal: its adherents 
intend to transport species from places that have become uninhabitable through places that 
humans have made impassable. Although it has its risks, assisted migration may be a necessary 
step in the evolution of conservation. 
1. The author of the passage implies that some endangered species are unlikely to migrate
naturally to habitats better suited to their survival because 
A. climate change is making such habitats disappear 
B. few if any viable routes to such habitats exist
C. the pace of natural migration is typically slower than the current pace of climate change 
D. their numbers are already below the thresholds necessary for the typically random processes of
natural dispersal 
E. their dependency on their current habitats is too strong
2. The passage suggests that, in order to adapt to changing conditions, conservationists should
A. reformulate their goals regarding the preservation of species 
B. turn their attention to reversing climate change 
C. end the practice of labeling certain species as endangered
D. reconsider the measures they use to protect endangered species
E. rely on natural processes of dispersal and change
passage 223
The North American red squirrel has expanded its range into Indiana in conjunction with an 
increase in the fragmentation of forests due to agriculture and with a decrease in the number of 
gray squirrels, whose population is sensitive to forest fragmentation. Red squirrels tend to hoard 
food in a central location, while gray squirrels are scatter hoarders. Burial of nuts by scatter 
hoarders is highly beneﬁcial for the regeneration of nut-producing trees. Red squirrels would have 
to collect 1,000 walnuts to achieve the same germination success that results from the handling of 
150 walnuts by gray squirrels. If red squirrels successfully colonize the fragmented landscapes of 
Indian in response to decreasing numbers of gray squirrels, they may not compensate completely 
for the loss of gray squirrels as seed dispersers. 
1. The passage implies that compared with gray squirrels red squirrels
A. are less effective seed dispersers 
B. are less successful colonizers 
C. are more efﬁcient at scatter-hoarding
D. do not bury as many nuts
E. do not collect as many nuts
2. Select the sentence in the passage that provides an illustration of a claim stated elsewhere in
the passage.
226


 passage 224
Norman Rockwell was the most popular illustrator in the United States during the mid-twentieth 
century, yet no important artist of his time showed interest in his work. This prompts the question; 
how good an artist was Rockwell? His technique is an adaptation of standard nineteenth-century 
verismo (an artistic movement marked by use of common everyday themes), competent but 
undistinguished. While he had an acute sense of gesture and facial expression, his anatomical 
competence was limited. In No Swimming (1921), for example, there is a bit of leg visible between 
the legs of the central ﬁgure that belongs to the boy lagging behind, but it is so shapeless that one 
cannot be considered a sophisticated perversion of expressive purposes as, for example, would 
the elastic spine in Ingres’s Grande Odalisque. However, Rockwell’s work does exhibit a genius in 
its fastidiousness about the absolute justness of every expression and its precise positioning of 
each prop. It is this attention to detail that renders unforgettable his best images, such as the open 
mouth in the form of an O of the little who has just discovered that there is no Santa Claus. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with 
A. describing a change in the reputation of a particular artist. 
B. suggesting that the work of particular artist has been overrated
C. evaluating the skill of particular artist. 
D. placing the work of a particular artist in its historical context.
E. contrasting two view of particular artist.
2. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would probably agree with which of the
following statements about Rockwell’s work? 
A. Rockwell’s work was evaluated fairly by the important artists of the mid-twentieth century. 
B. Rockwell’s work was dismissed by many of his mid-twentieth-century contemporaries because
they considered it primarily a product of popular culture rather than high art.
C. Although Rockwell’s work lacked artistic merit, it is important for what it reveals about mid- 
twentieth-century culture. 
D. Although Rockwell’s work was rejected by his contemporaries, he is now considered one of the
most important artists of the mid-twentieth century.
E. Although Rockwell’s work demonstrated a lack of certain skills, it does have qualities that make
it worthy of appreciation.
3. Select the sentence in the passage that indicates Rockwell’s artistic reputation among his
contemporaries.
227


 passage 225
Ecologists study how millions of species share the world, rather than take on the whole planet at 
once; they generally focus on a single ecosystem, be it a prairie, a tidal ﬂat, or a sand dune. Even 
within those limits, they are frustrated by porous frontiers. As a result, ecologists have done some 
of their most important work on islands, nature’s own isolated laboratories, which may be 
colonized only a few times over the course of millions of years. On them, ecologists have ﬁgured 
out how the size of a given habitat determine how many species it can support. They have then 
applied that knowledge to the mainland, showing how fragmented ecosystems become like 
archipelagoes, where extinctions can strike. 
1. It can be inferred that the term “porous frontiers” is used to refer to
A. a tendency for the area of an ecosystem to shrink 
B. human-caused processes that alter the character of an ecosystem
C. movement of species into an ecosystem from outside
D. variation in what the term “ecosystem” signiﬁes
E. lack of protection for endangered habitats
2. In the context in which it appears, “isolated” most nearly means
A. completely uncontaminated 
B. somewhat unusual 
C. extremely rare
D. relatively inaccessible
E. strictly conﬁned
passage 226
The border decoration in medieval manuscripts referred to as pen ﬂourishing reached great artistic 
heights in the northern Netherlands in the 1400s. The regional variants in form that evolved make 
ﬂourishing a useful tool for localizing and roughly dating manuscripts. When the ﬁrst printed books 
appeared in that region, many copies were still traditionally decorated by hand with such 
ﬂourishing. Since books’ publication can usually be dated with far more accuracy than manuscripts, 
studying these decorations in early printed books might lead to a more precise dating of the 
penwork in manuscripts. It is of less help in localizing the ﬂourishing. Upon completion, copies of 
printed books were often sold unadorned, to be decorated elsewhere as commissioned by 
their buyers. 
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It points out a difﬁculty involved in studying pen ﬂourishing 
B. It restates an assertion about the ﬁrst printed books 
C. It corrects a misconception regarding the decoration of manuscripts
D. It provides support for a claim about the dating of printed books 
E. It summarized an argument about how to interpret certain type of penwork.
2. According to the passage, pen ﬂourishing in manuscripts can provide historians with valuable
information about 
A. who commissioned the manuscript 
B. the source from which the manuscript was copied
C. the value placed on the contents of the manuscript 
D. where the manuscript was produced 
E. the collaborative process used to produce the manuscript

 passage 227
Early in the twentieth century, San Francisco was the main venue for African American jazz 
musicians on the West Coast of the United States. Musical activity was centered in a district known 
as the Barbary Coast, where an abundance of nightclubs provided ample work opportunities for 
local players and drew musicians and other entertainers, many of them African American, from 
throughout the country. In 1921, as part of its Prohibition-era efforts, the government closed the 
Barbary Coast. This closure was the decisive event that established Los Angeles as the premier 
center for jazz on the West Coast. Once the Barbary Coast was shut down, it became far harder 
for jazz musicians to make a living in San Francisco; thus, many headed south to Los Angeles. 
Yet even before that closing, the center of jazz activity had begun to swing southward. With the 
largest and fastest growing African American urban community in the West, as well as the growing 
movie industry and an emerging recording industry, Los Angeles was already a magnet for jazz 
musicians from other parts of the country, especially New Orleans, where jazz players suffered a 
devastating blow with closing of the Storyville district in 1917. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to 
A. point out the parallel effects on jazz music of governmental actions in San Francisco and New
Orleans 
B. offer an alternative to the standard explanation for the decline of San Francisco as a jazz center
C. argue for the importance of Californian cities in the development of jazz 
D. present and refute an argument about the reasons for a demographic shift in jazz activity 
E. outline the factors that contributed to a change in the Geographical locus of jazz activity
2. The passage cites which of the following as a factor helping to explain San Francisco’s
preeminence as a center for jazz music on the West Coast early in the twentieth century? 
A. The number of job opportunities for musicians in San Francisco’s nightclub district 
B. The efforts by the government to enforce Prohibition in San Francisco
C. The existence of venues for many different types of jazz in the San Francisco area 
D. The relative accessibility of San Francisco, as compared to Los Angeles, for musicians from
elsewhere in the country 
E. The fact that San Francisco at that time had a larger African American population than Los
Angeles
3. It can be inferred from the passage that, for African American musicians, which of the following
became an advantage of Los Angeles over San Francisco only after 1921? 
A. It became easier to travel to Los Angeles than to San Francisco 
B. Prohibition had less impact on the availability of work opportunities in Los Angeles
C. Nightclubs in Los Angeles offered better pay to jazz musicians than did nightclubs in San
Francisco
D. The movie industry in Los Angeles became an important source of employment for jazz
musicians
E. The African American community in Los Angeles began to expand rapidly

 passage 228
A recent exhibition of works by late-nineteenth-century painters Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, and 
Eva Gonzales offered a rich visual counterpart to studies focusing new attention on the social and 
ideological forces that inﬂuenced their work. The paintings by Gonzales were particularly 
illuminating. Long marginalized by scholars as little more than an apprentice of Edouard Manet, 
Gonzales is revealed by the exhibition as possessing remarkable, if uneven, talents. Given the 
exhibition’s focus, and especially the provocative new emphasis on Gonzales, the accompanying 
catalog proved disappointing. There often-quoted essays by critics contemporary to the artists—
essays in themselves noteworthy but historical artifacts nonetheless—provided the exhibition with 
its only critical readings. Thus, a signiﬁcant opportunity for scholarly debate was not only lost but 
even seemed pointedly avoided. 
1. Select the sentence in which the author describes and counters an assessment of a particular
artist.
2. In the context in which it appears, “counterpart to” most nearly means
A. duplicate of 
B. alternate to 
C. complement to
D. opposite of
E. emblem of
passage 229
Between 1970 and 1980, energy consumption by United States industry peaked and then declined, 
so that by 1980 total industrial use of energy was below the 1970 level even though total industrial 
output had grown substantially in the same period. Industry must have instituted highly effective 
energy conservation measures in those years to have achieved such impressive results. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the conclusion of the argument? 
A. Many industries switched to the greatest extent possible from high-priced oil to lower- priced
alternatives throughout the 1970's. 
B. Total residential energy consumption was higher in the United States in 1980 than it had been in
1970
C. Many industrial users of energy had paid little attention to energy conservation prior to 1970. 
D. Industrial output grew less rapidly from 1970 to 1980 than it had from 1960 to 1970.
E. The industries whose production dropped sharply during the 1970's included a
disproportionately large number of energy-intensive industries.
230


 passage 230
In the shallow end of Lake Tomwa, there are remains of numerous Jeffery pine trees that grew 
there during a lengthy drought. Researchers had believed that this drought lasted at least 150 
years, but carbon dating reveals that pines were growing in the lake bed for only 120 years, from 
1200 until 1320. Since the Jeffrey pines, which cannot survive in water, must have died at the end 
of the drought, the dating shows that the drought lasted less than 150 years. 
The argument given relies on which of the following as an assumption? 
A. No other species of tree started growing in the bed of Lake Tomwa after 1200. 
B. No tree remains of any kind are present at the bottom of deeper parts of Lake Tomwa. 
C. There was at least one tree in the lake bed that was alive for the entire period from 1200 to
1320.
D. There has not been a more recent drought that caused a drying up of the shallow end of the
lake. 
E. The shallow end of the lake had been dry for less than 30 years by the time Jeffrey pines started
growing in the lake bed.
passage 231
When on an airplane, Consuelo never enjoys movies that have been widely recommended 
because the poor quality of the picture spoils her enjoyment. Since in no circumstances does she 
ever enjoy movies that have been widely derided, it follows that she never enjoys movies on 
airplanes. 
Which of the following, if true, would enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn? 
A. The only place where Consuelo enjoys widely recommended movies is a movie theater.
B. Widely recommended movies are never shown on airplane.
C. If a movie shown on an airplane is not widely derided, then it is invariable widely recommended. 
D. If the picture quality of the movies shown on airplanes was better, Consuelo would enjoy the
widely recommended movies. 
E. Some movies are neither widely recommended nor widely derided.
passage 232
Recently an unusually high number of dolphins have been found dead of infectious diseases, and 
most of these had abnormally high tissue concentrations of certain compounds that, even in low 
concentrations, reduce dolphins’ resistance to infection. The only source of these compounds in 
the dolphins’ environment is boat paint. Therefore, since dolphins rid their bodies of the 
compounds rapidly once exposure ceases, their mortality rate should decline rapidly if such boat 
paints are banned. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
A. The levels of the compounds typically used in boat paints today are lower than they were in boat
paints manufactured a decade ago. 
B. In high concentrations, the compounds are toxic to many types of marine animals. 
C. The compounds break down into harmless substances after a few months of exposure to water
or air. 
D. High tissue levels of the compounds have recently been found in some marine animals, but
there is no record of any of those animals dying in unusually large numbers recently. 
E. The compounds do not leach out of the boat paint if the paint is applied exactly in accordance
with the manufacturer’s directions.
231


 passage 233
Iridium, a hard, whitish metal similar to platinum, is extremely rare on Earth. Extremely high 
concentrations of iridium on Earth result from only two scenarios: massive volcanic eruptions that 
release iridium from deep within the Earth and meteorites that shower down on Earth from space. 
When scientists found concentrations of iridium 30 times higher than normal in rock stratum from 
65 million years ago, they concluded that a massive meteor or comet hit the Earth and caused the 
massive extinction of the dinosaurs. 
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the scientist’s conclusion? 
A. Volcanoes massive enough to generate high concentrations of iridium are very rare. 
B. Massive volcanic eruptions occurred frequently 80 million years ago. 
C. Most scientists support the hypothesis that a cosmic impact wiped out the dinosaurs. 
D. The massive extinction that occurred 70 million years ago killed not only the dinosaurs but also
70 percent of all life on Earth. 
E. A comet struck the earth some 120 million years ago, but no widespread extinction occurred.
passage 234
Upon maturity, monarch butterﬂies travel hundreds of miles from their places of origin and lay their 
eggs on milkweed. The caterpillars that emerge feed on milkweed and absorb the glycosides in 
milkweed sap. The speciﬁc glycosides present in milkweed differ from region to region within the 
monarch butterﬂy’s range. Since mature butterﬂies retain the glycosides, the glycosides in a 
mature monarch butterﬂy could be used to determine its place of origin. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
A. Mature monarch butterﬂies do not feed on parts of milkweed that contain glycosides.
B. The glycosides in milkweed sap are slightly toxic to caterpillars of other species. 
C. The vast majority of the monarch butterﬂies that are laying eggs in a given region will have
traveled there from a single region.
D. There are substances other than glycosides in milkweed sap that accumulate in a monarch
caterpillar and are retained in the body of the mature butterﬂy. 
E. There are certain glycosides that are found in the sap of all milkweeds, no matter where they
grow within the monarch butterﬂy’s range.
232


 passage 235
When rats are placed under conditions of stress, their adrenal glands immediately increase 
production of the hormone corticosterone, and soon thereafter the rats’ white blood cell count 
drops substantially. Yet rats without functioning adrenal glands experience little decrease in white 
blood cell count when placed under conditions of stress. It is likely, therefore, that an increase in 
corticosterone produced by a rat’s adrenal glands causes the rat’s white blood cell count to 
decrease. 
Which of the following would it be most useful to know in evaluating the reasoning of the 
argument? 
A. Whether the drop in white blood cell count that occurs in rats under conditions of stress is
sufﬁcient to make the rats more susceptible to diseases that white blood cells normally combat
B. Whether normal white blood cell counts vary widely among healthy rats that are not under
conditions of stress 
C. Whether the adrenal glands of rats that are under conditions of stress increase production of
any hormone other than corticosterone
D. Whether the adrenal glands of rats produce elevated levels of corticosterone on occasions
when the rats are not under conditions of stress 
E. Whether rats’ adrenal glands are affected by hormones produced by any of the rats’ other
organs.
passage 236
Some psychologists have proposed the hypothesis that children in different cultures have different 
psychologies, demonstrated, for example, by culture-speciﬁc tendencies for the children’s behavior 
to be relatively self-assertive or obedient. However, that hypothesis is incorrect, since the 
psychological mechanisms by which children acquire behavioral traits are identical for all cultures. 
In the argument, the author’s position and the position challenged by the author differ in the criteria 
they use to distinguish different 
A. behaviors 
B. cultures
C. mechanisms
D. psychologies
E. traits
233


 passage 237
Scholars have tended to treat the ideas of American social reformer Jane Addams as unique, 
failing to compare them sufﬁciently those of other social activists and public intellectuals. Recent 
work, however, has situated her more thoroughly in the thinking and events of her time. For 
example, labor historians have usefully contextualized Addams’ close work with labor unions in the 
1890s. When Addams’ interest in the workers’ reform agenda is understood in relation to the 
history of trade unionism in Chicago and its impressive record of political action, her 
contribution emerges as far more cooperative than groundbreaking. Workers inﬂuenced her in 
ways not preciously appreciated. Such contextualizing efforts make it possible to see what Addams 
learned from other reformers and what she contributed herself.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. criticize Addams for not realizing the extent of her debt to other social activists and public
intellectuals
B. describe how scholars have misunderstood Addams’ ideas regarding social reform
C. outline a debate within the historical community regarding Addams’ approach to social reform
D. emphasize the importance of placing Addams’ work in a larger framework of reform and
activism
E. discuss the impact of Addams’ close work with labor union on working conditions in the 1890s
2. The author refers to the “history of trade unionism in Chicago” primarily as
A. an issue that has been largely ignored by historians
B. an issue that has inspired contention among historians
C. a model for how trade unionists might engage in political action
D. an area in which Addams’ contributions have been underestimated
E. a valuable context for understanding the nature of Addams’ contributions
passage 238
Because different mammalian species favor different environments, identifying and counting bones 
from prehistoric deposits in caves can reveal much about climatic change. However, using large 
mammals’ bones can be problematic. Some species, such as red deer, are very adaptable—at 
home on both open may have traveled considerable distances before being discarded: both 
carnivores and humans can have large hunting territories and bring home large animals quite 
unlike those near their den or campsite. Consequently, the bones of the small mammals found with 
cave sediments provide a better index of climate change they are generally more numerous, the 
species are more sensitive to environmental conditions, and few travel far within their short lives.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. The passage mentions which of the following as an obstacle to using animal bones to
reconstruct past climate changes?
A. The size of some carnivorous species’ hunting territories
B. The range over which some small mammals travel
C. The ability of some species to thrive in multiple types of environment
2. The passage mentions “red deer” as an instance of an animal that
A. is likely to be transported long distances by carnivores or human
B. is frequently represented in prehistoric bone deposits
C. can be used to reconstruct past climate changes
D. can travel considerable distances over the course of its life
E. yields limited information about past environmental conditions
234


 passage 239
Seeding a forest with nonnative species after a ﬁre can impede native plant regeneration and 
spread invasive species in vulnerable ﬁre-affected soils. Moreover, native seed sources are almost 
always sufﬁcient for early nature reestablishment of native species, so planting should be 
considered only when natural regeneration is unlikely. Replanting dense stands of fast-growing 
conifers---a common postﬁre management practice---truncates the biologically rich early stage of 
ecological succession and can increase the severity of future ﬁres. Other treatments should be 
carefully scrutinized for their potential to spread noxious weeds. For instance, straw much applied 
extensively to reduce erosion after the 2002 Hayman Fire in Colorado was contaminated with 
cheatgrass, an invasive grass difﬁcult to control or eradicate once established.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. According to the passage, which of the following is a consequence of replanting an area with
dense stands of fast-growing confers after a ﬁre?
A. The normal progression of ecological development will be affected.
B. The conifers will be slower growing than if they had been less densely planted.
C. Subsequent ﬁres may be more severe than they would have been if such a replanting had not
been done.
2. The passage implies which of the following about native plant regeneration in forests after a ﬁre?
A. It is hampered by the changed nature of the ﬁre-affected soils.
B. It will generally occur without the human interventions of reseeding or replanting.
C. The likelihood of its success increases when forest managers have on hand a good supply of
native seed sources.
D. Native plants will inevitably have to compete with nonnative plants.
E. The earlier nature reestablishment occurs, the more complete it will be.

 passage 240
In the late 1990s, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft detected magnetized patches of terrain 
near the north pole of Mars and also in the Terra Sirenum region, which is in the planet’s southern 
hemisphere. These magnetic features may be relics of a global magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of 
several huge, ancient craters in the Terra Sirenum region, astronomers believe these craters were 
formed some 3.8 billion years ago from the impact of chunks of debris pelting the inner solar 
system, where Mars orbits the Sun. If a global magnetic ﬁeld once existed on Mars, it must have 
vanished before these craters formed. Such large impacts beat rock to temperatures well above 
600 degrees Celsius---high enough to erase any magnetic ﬁeld that metallic particle within the rock 
strong at the time the craters formed, it would have realigned and remagnetized the articles as they 
cooled. The Surveyor ﬁndings thus suggest the magnetic ﬁeld vanished early in the planet’s 
4.5 billion year existence.
1. According to the passage, astronomers believe which of the following about the “chunks of
debris”?
A. They may have destroyed a global magnetic ﬁeld that once existed on Mars.
B. They affected Mars more substantially than other planet in the inner solar system.
C. Some of them contained a higher concentration of metallic particles than did rocks on Mars.
D. Some of them caused craters that exist in the Terra Sirenum region of Mars.
E. Few of them were large enough to cause impacts that would beat rocks to 600 degrees Celsius.
2. The author’s conclusion in the ﬁnal sentence of the passage is based in part on which of the
following points?
A. Elsewhere on Mars there are likely to be patches of magnetized terrain similar to those that the
Mars Global Surveyor detected.
B. Planets other than Mars could have been affected by the chunks of debris that pelted the inner
solar system 3.0 billion years ago.
C. A global magnetic ﬁeld on Mars could have remagnetized metallic particles that had lost their
magnetic ﬁeld.
D. Not all collisions between debris chunks and planets result in the formation of craters.
E. Impacts much smaller than the ones that probably created the craters in the Terra Sirenum
region do not heat rocks to temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius.
3. The author of the passage mentions the “inner solar system” in the course of
A. explaining how Mars may have acquired a global magnetic ﬁeld
B. explaining how scientists estimate the probable age of Mars
C. accounting for the size and location of magnetized patches of terrain detected on Mars

 passage 241
Standard accounts of the history of Brazilian samba often fail to distinguish the dance 
from the music. The particular features of the speciﬁc musical genre now called 
samba ﬁrst appeared together in the 1917 carnival hit “Pelo telefone,” and histories of 
samba tend to date its musical origins accordingly, although modern samba did not 
fully crystallize until the 1920s. But the word samba    was used in Brazil during the 
nineteenth century to refer rather generically to polyrhythmic dance with percussive 
accompaniment enjoyed by Brazilians of African origin (Afro-Brazilians). It was more 
of an event or a style of body movement than a particular step. In this nineteenth-
century sense of the word, samba was already a part of Rio de Janeiro’s annual pre-
Lenten carnival a full generation before the ﬁrst samba schools (neighborhood 
dancing clubs) developed in the late 1920s.
In the elaboration of Brazilian national identity, this difference in timing is signiﬁcant. 
In the years following 1917, a widely endorsed vision of national identity founded on 
the idea of racial mixing developed. To many * Brazilians * , post 1917 samba, 
understood as a blend of African and Portuguese musical ideas, stands as one of the 
most persuasive emblems of a cherished vision of racially mixed national identity, 
linked through carnival to a myth of social leveling which, though enacted only during 
the few days of the festival, still forms part of a unifying national spirit. To some 
critics, on the other hand, the national gloriﬁcation of what they consider an Afro 
Brazilian dance is a kind of theft, an appropriation of Black culture by the primarily 
Euro Brazilian dominant class. According to these critics, the powerful rhythms of 
batuque, a sacred dance of African origin that is the ancestor of samba, emerged 
abruptly from the conﬁnes of Black culture in the early twentieth century and entered 
the wider popular culture transformed into samba, a misleading symbol of the 
supposed esteem in which the nation held Afro Brazilians. In fact, these critics argue, 
the symbol was used in the 1920s and 1930s during a period of political turmoil by 
Euro Brazilian elites and the anti-democratic nationalist government of Getúlio 
Vargas to consolidate political dominance.
While there is some truth to this view, it is a mistake to see modern samba as a ﬁrst-
generation child of batuque. Samba, the dance, does have its ultimate origins in 
seventeenth-century batuques, but during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it 
evolved through several intermediate stages and split into various, mutually 
inﬂuencing, genres, including not only the Black street pageant Congos, long agreed 
to be one of samba’s ancestors, but also polyrhythmic Afro-Brazilian dances with 
percussive accompaniment, such as lundu and maxixe, that thrived in social 
situations where partners of different races came together. Because one source of 
samba's power as a symbol of racially mixed Brazilian identity is its history of racial 
mixing, that symbol is more than a simple appropriation of a “pure” Afro-Brazilian 
culture.

 passage 242
Paintings of property—anything that was possessed—such as those created by eighteenth-century 
British painter George Stubbs were condemned by several of Stubbs’s contemporaries: objects 
thus  “individualized”  would appeal to our appetite to own and enjoy them, whereas “generalized” 
objects in other paintings were no longer merely things but abstract ideas. To collect or commission  
paintings displaying lofty unconcern with materiality was considered by these commentators a 
mark of taste and civic virtue, the ability to subordinate private material interests to the abstract, 
public interest. Yet this  notion  of disinterested taste and virtue was founded on private interest: it 
was because the “public” man or woman already owned enough that he or she was presumed to 
be free from the urge to own more. Political power and status were thus based on the ownership of 
property, while at the same time they were legitimated by the claim that the avaricious behavior  
associated with the acquisition of property was somehow transcended by those who had already 
acquired it.

C. Such paintings were often collected by people who were quite property-rich.
D. Collectors of such paintings often displayed them for the public’s beneﬁt.
E. Collectors of such paintings were, as a class, the most avaricious members of their society.

 passage 243
Typical of Argentine melodrama of the 1930s were the ﬁlms starring Libertad Lamarque, the 
genre’s biggest box-ofﬁce attraction. Her most frequent role was that of the tango singer whose 
romance with a wealthy suitor is blocked by his elitist family. Despite its widespread social 
acceptance by the 1930s, tango continued to be associated in ﬁlm melodramas with criminality and 
vice. As Diana Paladino remarks, in these ﬁlms,  “the tango songstress was doomed from the 
start.”  Nevertheless, if melodramatic logic dictated that Lamarque be punished for the 
transgressive act of singing tango, surely that judgment was not shared by the members of the 
audience, many of whom were drawn to her early movies precisely because of her fame as a 
tango singer.
1. Which of the following claims about Lamarque can be inferred from the passage?
A. She considered herself to be primarily a tango singer rather than a movie actor.
B. By the end of her movie career, she was exercising considerable control over the writing and
direction of her ﬁlms.
C. Her personality differed greatly from those of the characters she portrayed in ﬁlms.
D. Her popularity as a tango singer preceded her popularity as an actor.
E. She continued to act in movies after she had ceased performing as a tango singer.
2. According to the author of the passage, which of the following is true about the tango?
A. By the time Lamarque starred in ﬁlms as a tango singer, the tango was socially acceptable.
B. Outside Argentina the tango’s reputation was quite different from what prevailed in Argentina.
C. The tango began to gain popularity in Argentina once it became an element in melodramatic
ﬁlms.
D. By the 1930s, no one in Argentina associated the tango with criminality and vice.
E. Until the 1930s, the tango was primarily thought of as a dance form rather than as a genre of
song.

 passage 244
Progressivism, the wave of reform movements in the early twentieth century whose stated intention 
was to make United States society more democratic, has undergone signiﬁcant scholarly 
reevaluation by historians over the years. In the 1960s, leftist scholars dismissed progressive 
reform as a mask for the empowerment of individuals forming a corporate, capitalist elite. In the 
two subsequent decades, many scholars began to question whether there was any such thing as 
progressivism; the phenomenon seemed so diverse and amorphous that the word itself, some 
claimed, had no meaning. In the early 1990s, however, the tone, if not always the substance, of 
historical accounts of progressivism changed again. Although some scholars admitted that 
progressivism was diverse, they insisted that there is an identiﬁable “progressive minimum, ” a 
core of belief and action that lends coherence to the concept Further, some scholars, while 
acknowledging that progressivism had some conservative and even reactionary results, argue that 
the motives behind many of the reform movements of the era were genuinely democratic.
1. Which of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
A. A theory is proposed, refuted, and then amended.
B. The thesis of the passage is stated and several views for and against that thesis are compared
and contrasted.
C. Opposing views are presented, classiﬁed, and then reconciled.
D. An assertion is made and an elaboration of that assertion is provided.
E. An argument is advanced and evidence is presented to refute it.
2. According to the passage, the term “progressive minimum” is used by scholars who have
A. determined the quintessential elements of reform movements in general
B. claimed that progressivism was a movement grounded in a set of common beliefs
C. underrated the impact and historical signiﬁcance of progressivism
D. deﬁned progressivism as a uniﬁed effort led by a core of proponents
E. questioned the basic motivation underlying the inception of progressivism
3. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. analyze the early-twentieth-century sociopolitical environment of the United States
B. afﬁrm the profound differences among reformist groups contending for power in the early- 
twentieth-century United states
C. explain a radical approach to promoting democracy in the early twentieth-century United States
D. argue that the results achieved by several decades of reform activity begun in the early- 
twentieth-century United States were paradoxical
E. trace the course of inquiry over time regarding an aspect of early twentieth-century United
States history

 passage 245
Native American music is unique in the world in having almost no string instruments. The fretless, 
single-string violin of Mexico’s Seri Indians is therefore often remarked on in studies of Native 
American music. Most scholars assume that the Seri violin descended from the European violin. 
The Spanish introduced a variety of string instruments to Mexico following the conquest (1519), 
and these subsequently spread widely in many forms. However, Helen Roberts questions other 
scholars’ arguments that Mexican string instruments could not have preconquest origins simply 
because they are not mentioned by early Spanish sources and do not appear in indigenous 
Mexican illustrations. Roberts argues that because of their low volume, string instruments would 
not have been used in loud group contexts such as those depicted in Mexican manuscripts.
1. In the context in which it appears, “simply” most nearly means
A. artlessly
B. frankly
C. ordinarily
D. slightly
E. just
2. It can be inferred from the passage that the view held by most scholars regarding the origins of
the Seri violin is based in part on
A. differences between the Seri violin and European violins
B. the rarity of string instruments among Native American peoples
C. the fact that the Seri violin lacks frets and has only a single string
D. a resemblance between the Seri violin and Spanish string instruments of the sixteenth century
E. the means by which string instruments spread in Mexico following the conquest
3. The passage suggests that in Roberts’ view, the Seri violin
A. may be represented in Mexican manuscripts that have yet to be found
B. was probably modeled on string instruments introduced to Mexico by the Spanish
C. was not likely to have been in use prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico
D. was best suited for playing in relatively quiet settings
E. was probably capable of greater volume than most scholars have assumed
4. Which of the following best describes the purpose of the highlighted sentence in the passage as
a whole?
A. It introduces an alternative to a widely held view.
B. It casts doubt on a point made in the ﬁrst sentence of the passage.
C. It explains why scholars disagree about a particular issue.
D. It cites evidence overlooked by scholars previously mentioned in the passage.
E. It suggests a reason for the assumption mentioned in the preceding sentence.

 passage 246
Chimpanzees can detect when others can and cannot see them. With one another, for example, 
they use visually based gestures mostly when the potential recipient is attending to them already. 
Indeed, if the potential recipient is not attending to them, they will sometimes walk around in front 
of her before gesturing. In support of these ﬁndings, Liebal et al. found in an experimental study 
that when a human who was facing a chimpanzee and giving him food then turned his back to the 
chimpanzee, the chimpanzee subject walked around him to face him again before gesturing.
Povinelli and Eddy found that chimpanzees do not preferentially beg food from a human with 
uncovered eyes over begging it from one wearing a blindfold. This suggests that they do not know 
when others can and cannot see them. But Kaminski et al. modiﬁed this paradigm slightly to reﬂect 
more natural communicative situations, and they found different results. Their modiﬁcation was that 
the chimpanzees did not have to choose between two human communicators—a very unnatural 
situation—but were always faced with only one communicator who was oriented in different ways 
in different experimental conditions. For example, in one condition the human faced the subject. In 
another, his back and head were both facing away. In yet another, his body was turned away as he 
looked back over his shoulder at the subject. The main ﬁnding was that chimpanzees gestured 
differently to the human depending on whether the human’s face was oriented toward them, but 
only if the human was facing them bodily as well. Kaminski et al. argued, therefore, that body 
orientation and face orientation indicate two different things to an ape when it begs food from a 
human. Whereas body orientation indicates the human’s disposition to give the subject food (i.e., 
when he is oriented so as to transfer food effectively), face orientation indicates whether the 
human is able to see the subject’s begging gesture. This two-factor account helps to explain 
Povinelli and Eddy’s negative ﬁndings.
Interestingly and signiﬁcantly, Kaminski et al, found that as long as the human was facing 
them, chimpanzees did not differentiate between the human's eyes being open and closed. 
This accords with the ﬁndings of Tomasello et al. that in gaze-following situations chimpanzees 
follow mainly the direction of the head as a whole, and to a much lesser extent the direction of the 
eyes.
1. The author of the passage would probably agree with which of the following about Povinelli and
Eddy’s study?
A. The chimpanzees in the study thought that the blindfolded human was able to see them.
B. The study was ﬂawed because it put chimpanzees in the unnatural position of begging for food.
C. The chimpanzees in the study were confused by the body orientation of the human subjects.
D. It would be difﬁcult for Povinelli and Eddy to repeat the results of their study even with the same
experimental conditions.
E. It is likely that the chimpanzees in the study thought that both humans were unable to see them.
2. Based on the discussion of Kaminski et al., which of the following situations would indicate to a
chimpanzee that it cannot be seen by a human?
A. The human’s body is facing the chimpanzee, but the human’s face is turned away.
B. The human’s body is turned away, but the human’s face is turned over the shoulder toward the
chimpanzee.
C. The human’s body and head are both facing away from the chimpanzee.
3. It can be inferred that for Kaminski et al. the examples highlighted were meant to
A. explore the range of gestures that chimpanzees have been known to use
B. illustrate the communicative situations in which chimpanzees tend to be most comfortable
C. examine the possibility that chimpanzees might become confused under certain experimental
situations
D. provide a range of communicative conditions similar to those likely experienced by chimpanzees
E. illustrate how chimpanzee gesturing changes according to the species of the recipient

perception
D. discuss the signiﬁcance of certain gestures commonly manifested by wild chimpanzees
E. challenge the methodology used in several experimental studies of chimpanzee behavior

A. delineate the nature of an ongoing controversy
B. consider the viability of several alternative views
C. reveal a contradiction in the conventional perspective
D. call into question the work of Liebal et al.
E. account for an apparently discrepant ﬁnding
6. The author would be likely to agree with which of the following about Povinelli and Eddy’s study?
A. The chimpanzees in the study were confused by the body orientation of the human subjects
B. The chimpanzees in the study probably thought that the blindfolded human was able to see
them.
C. The validity of the study’s conclusions was compromised by the artiﬁciality of the study’s
conditions.
7. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about gesturing in chimpanzees?
A. It is done purposefully.
B. It is difﬁcult for humans to interpret.
C. It is ineffective as a means of communication.
D. It is something that only some chimpanzees do regularly.
E. It is used primarily in relation to food.

 passage 247
The evolutionary battle between farmers and the pests that attack their crops began during the 
earliest days of agriculture, when farmers selected the healthiest plants from one season as the 
source of seed for the next, making it more likely that each generation would produce more of the 
repellents and toxins needed to fend off pests. But the pests represented a moving target. As a 
result, pest populations evolved characteristics and behaviors that enabled them to resist such 
toxins and repellents. In recent years, this conﬂict has escalated sharply, as modern farmers not 
only rely on old methods of dealing with pests but also develop new ones, and the resulting 
pressure on pests to adapt thereby increases. For this reason, many of the shorter-term triumphs 
by farmers have carried within them the seeds of longer-term failure.
Some years ago, for example, geneticists theorized that one way to control caterpillars would be to 
incorporate into crop plants genes that stimulated the production of caterpillar toxins derived from a 
species of bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt. Since this bacterium and the caterpillars had both 
been around for millions of years, geneticists assumed that if the caterpillars had the genetic 
potential to develop resistance to the toxins, they would have done so. What the geneticists 
overlooked was the fact that in natural environments, outbreaks of this bacterium were extremely 
rare, so the pressure on the caterpillar to adapt to the toxins was quite low in nature. The 
caterpillars’ genetic potential may never have had occasion to prominently display itself. Indeed, 
this point was borne out when some caterpillar populations developed signiﬁcant resistance to 
these bacterial toxins as a result of farmers’ unusually heavy reliance on them for controlling 
caterpillars.
Food deprivation appears to offer another effective approach to pest control. Farmers alternate 
planting of an insect’s normal host plant with a plant that it cannot feed on, and the pest dies of 
starvation. But some insects have even begun to adapt to this normally quite effective strategy. 
During the 1980s, farmers in South Dakota reported experiencing trouble with the northern corn 
rootworm, despite the fact that they were routinely rotating corn and soybean crops. Scientists 
discovered that the rootworm had in fact adapted to this strategy. In large areas of the Midwest, 
where corn is grown every year, the corn rootworms produce eggs that remain in the soil for one 
winter and then hatch and feed on young corn roots in the following spring. In areas where fanners 
rotated corn with other crops that the rootworm could not eat, about 40%percent of the rootworm 
eggs were remaining in diapause, a rest state, for a second winter. This part of the rootworm 
population now exhibited a diapause that was synchronized to the rotation of the corn crop.
1. Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?
A. A generalization is made and two speciﬁc instances are provided to illustrate it.
B. A phenomenon is described and two possible explanations are presented and evaluated.
C. A new explanation of a phenomenon is presented and evidence of its advantages over earlier
explanations is provided.
D. An approach to solving a problem is described and certain obstacles to its implementation are
discussed.
E. A hypothesis is summarized and evidence that has traditionally been presented in support of it is
evaluated.
2. According to the author, the strategy of rotating crops to eliminate pests has been
A. effective in many instances
B. used since the earliest days of agriculture
C. less effective than genetic manipulation of plants
D. most popular in the midwestern United States
E. less effective against the northern corn rootworm than against caterpillars
245


3. Each of the following, if true, could provide a logical explanation for why farmers in large areas
of the midwestern United States do not rotate their corn crops EXCEPT:
A. The cost of rotating corn with soybeans is greater than the cost of accepting lower yields of corn
as a result of damage inﬂicted by the northern corn rootworm.
B. A safe and effective combination of insecticides has been found to be more effective at
eradicating northern corn rootworm than has crop rotation.
C. The capacity of the northern corn rootworm to synchronize its diapause with farmers rotation
schedule has made this method of control signiﬁcantly less effective.
D. The price that the farmers can get for soybeans and other crops that could be effectively rotated
with corn has dropped signiﬁcantly.
E. Farmers have yet to discover a variety of corn that can effectively resist northern corn rootworm.
4. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. outlining the assumptions underlying an incorrect theory about the evolution of pests
B. discussing the use of bacteria to control certain kinds of agricultural pests
C. countering a claim regarding the nature of a seemingly intractable pest control problem
D. evaluating some innovative proposals for overcoming pest control problems
E. explaining why farmers have been unable to overcome a continuing pest control problem
246


 passage 248
After the identiﬁcation of three of the main macronutrients that plants need to grow— nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and potassium (N-P-K)—and the development of manufactured nitrogen fertilizer in 
the 1910s, agricultural soils began receiving large doses of N-P-K but little else. Early agronomists 
overlooked the importance of biological activity provided by the underground ecosystem of soil 
microbes, earthworms, and Mycorrhizal fungi. Chemical fertilizers such as N-P-K depress this 
activity, increasing plants’ vulnerability to pests and diseases. They might also diminish crops’ 
nutritional quality, which has declined substantially since the widespread adoption of chemical 
fertilizers. Some researchers attribute this decline to the condition of the soil; others cite the 
tendency of modern plant breeding to select for characteristics such as yield rather than nutritional 
quality.
1. According to the passage, which of the following typically distinguishes soil nourished
exclusively by N-P-K fertilizers from unfertilized soils?
A. Lower average yields
B. Higher earthworm populations
C. Slower crop growth
D. Less microbial activity
E. Increased resistance to pests
2. The author of the passage would most likely agree that the widespread use of N-P-K fertilizers
A. has encouraged plant breeders to select for yield rather than other characteristics
B. caused early agronomists to ignore the importance of biological activity in soils
C. has diverted attention away from the nutritional value of crops
D. spurred attempts to reproduce the effect of microbial activity in the soil
E. has resulted in plants that are less hardy
passage 249
Meltzoff and Moore reported experiments showing that human newborns possess the ability to 
imitate certain facial expressions, such as a protruding tongue or an open mouth. Yet numerous 
researchers challenge Meltzoff’s interpretation that such neonatal imitation is the origin of later 
imitation, which appears at approximately eight to twelve months of age. These researchers point 
out that the neonatal imitative response disappears or is lessened at approximately two months. 
Moreover, since in follow-up studies only one type of imitative response toward a facial expression 
(that is, tongue protrusion) was observed, some researchers assert that neonatal imitation is not 
imitation at all but may simply be a form of exploratory behavior in response to interesting stimuli.
1. The passage implies which of the following about the experimental results reported by Meltzoff
and Moore?
A. They were, at best, only partially borne out by subsequent studies.
B. They cast doubt on the validity of a particular claim about newborns.
C. They formed the basis for revised interpretations of other behaviors of newborns.
D. They derived from a methodology that turned out to be ﬂawed.
E. They challenged the distinction between imitative and nonimitative behavior in newborns.
2. According to the passage, those who challenge “Meltzoff’s interpretation” do so on the basis that
it
A. implies inaccurate predictions
B. lacks testable consequences
C. assumes a discredited theory
D. leaves an unexplained gap
E. involves circular reasoning
247


 passage 250
In “The Franklin’s Tale,” from Chaucer’s fourteenth-century Canterbury Tales—, a Clerk uses 
medieval astronomical tables, calculating lunar and solar positions, to predict an extraordinarily 
high ﬂood tide. Literary scholar Phyllis Hodgson has concluded that Chaucer’s purpose here is 
artistic, not scientiﬁc, and that even though Chaucer was a master of astronomy and author of an 
astrolabe treatise, this “highly technical account of the Clerk’s astrological calculations need not be 
taken too seriously.” Recently, however, astronomer Don Olson concluded that Chaucer’s account 
actually describes a very rare astronomical conﬁguration of the Sun, Moon, and Earth that 
produced an exceptionally high tide in December 1340.  But why would Chaucer be aware of a 
high tide that occurred in 1340, some ﬁve decades before “The Franklin’s Tale” was written  Some 
scholars place Chaucer’s birth in late 1340 or early 134A.   When Chaucer was studying 
astronomy during the 1380s and 1390s, it is plausible that he investigated his own horoscope. 
Chaucer may have discovered the remarkable tide-raising conﬁguration in 1340 while calculating 
celestial positions at the time of his own birth and then used this knowledge as inspiration for the 
plot device in “The Franklin’s Tale.”
1. Which of the following statements regarding medieval astronomers can be inferred from the
passage?
A. They were skeptical of the idea that certain astronomical conﬁgurations could produce high
ﬂood tides.
B. They had an understanding of the effect of the Sun and Moon on ocean tides.
C. They could calculate lunar positions with some accuracy, but not the positions of the Sun and
Earth.
D. Although they were highly skilled in celestial calculations, they were unlikely to apply this
knowledge to predictions of events on Earth.
E. They possessed the mathematical skills for performing only the simplest of astronomical
calculations.
2. It can be inferred that Hodgson would agree with which of the following statements about the
Clerk’s astronomical calculations?
A. The Clerk’s calculations do not add artistic merit to “The franklin’s Tale.”
B. Chaucer’s purpose in describing the Clerk’s calculations is to instruct readers in the rudiments of
astronomy.
C. Chaucer’s intent in using technical material was not to provide a scientiﬁcally valid discussion.
D. The Clerk’s ability to predict a high ﬂood tide is implausible, given the level of scientiﬁc
knowledge in the late fourteenth century.
E. The technical language that Chaucer uses in describing the calculations does not reﬂect the
scientiﬁc terminology of the time.
3. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. explain how fourteenth-century astronomers used complicated astronomical calculations to
predict unusually high tides
B. show how medieval and modern methods predict similar effects of astronomical conﬁgurations
on tides
C. argue that modern literary scholars should take Chaucer’s scientiﬁc references throughout The
Canterbury Tales more seriously
D. describe Chaucer’s fascination with astronomy in general and with horoscopes in particular
E. present an explanation that supports the scientiﬁc veracity of a particular passage in The
Canterbury Tales
248


 passage 251
In 1876 Edmond Duranty dubbed the style of emerging French impressionist artists “The New 
Painting.” More than a style, the Impressionists’ luminous landscapes were regarded as a new way 
of seeing. Of course, it was not wholly new. The English painters Constable and Turner, whose 
work French artists knew, had already painted out of doors earlier in the century and 
brilliantly sought to capture the impact of natural scenes on their sensibility. Courbet’s 
tough-minded realism and Jongkind’s harbor scenes also had much to teach the emergent 
movement. The Impressionists never denied this ancestry; but they were aware, too, that they had 
taken these painters’ unconventional experiments to unfamiliar levels and, consolidating 
themselves as a movement, had indeed made painting new.
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It provides support for an assertion made previously in the passage.
B. It undermines a claim made earlier in the passage.
C. It questions the usefulness of categorizing artists into particular movements.
D. It identiﬁes painters whose works were praised by some Impressionists.
E. It suggests that painting out of doors was unusual during the early 1800s.
2. The passage suggests that the impact of Impressionism can be attributed in part to
A. Duranty’s enthusiastic promotion of the movement
B. the moribund state of painting when Impressionists ﬁrst presented their works
C. the widespread popularity in France of works by Courbet and Jongkind
D. a lack of earlier examples of outdoor painting
E. the solidarity of its practitioners

 passage 252
Shapin’s book demonstrates that contrary to a widely held belief, industrial research has not 
invariably been more regimented than academic science. He argues that the intellectual freedom 
historically available to industrial scientists during the twentieth century has been underestimated. 
Many companies, recognizing that the results of scientiﬁc investigation were necessarily uncertain  
and that proﬁts, if any, might take years to materialize, granted scientists considerable latitude to 
develop their ideas and follow them in unexpected directions. Some companies even provided 
senior scientists with free time to pursue their own research interests, whatever they might be. 
Consequently, some scientists were drawn to industrial research not primarily because of the 
generally good ﬁnancial compensation but because they saw industry as the best place to do 
cutting-edge research.
1. The passage’s discussion of “free time” suggests that
A. senior scientists in industry have been less likely than junior scientists to remain in positions
where opportunities to conduct their own research are restricted
B. scientists who work in industry can gain ﬁnancially from their own independent research as well
as from research they conduct for their companies
C. scientists who work in industry have tended to become frustrated by their employers’
expectations that their research will be restricted to areas deemed to be in the employers’ interests
D. industry has sometimes been willing to support scientiﬁc research that has no prospect of
yielding a direct proﬁt
E. industrial scientists have not differed from academic scientists in the amount of time they are
able to dedicate to pure research
2. It can be inferred that those who hold the “belief” mentioned in the passage would be most likely
to agree with which of the following statements about scientists?
A. Scientists who conduct research in university settings have generally been less motivated than
researchers employed in industry to pursue scientiﬁc inquiries solely for the sake of advancing
knowledge.
B. Scientists have not been primarily motivated by ﬁnancial considerations in choosing among
different professional settings in which to conduct their research.
C. Scientists employed by for-proﬁt companies have always tended to have their research
restricted by their companies’ interests.
D. Scientists have tended to be less concerned about the regimentation of industrial research than
nonscientists generally assume.
E. Scientists should be more skeptical than they generally have been about the reliability of
research conducted by for-proﬁt companies.
3. The author of the passage mentions companies’ recognition that “the results of scientiﬁc
investigation were necessarily uncertain” primarily in order to
A. suggest that industrial scientists often faced a different set of challenges than did academic
scientists
B. present a premise that motivated some companies’ policies regarding their scientists’ research
C. explain how companies calculated possible future proﬁts from research undertaken by their
scientists
D. refute a common assumption about the costs associated with industrial research relative to the
costs of academic research
E. explain how the expectations of scientists conducting industrial research differed from those of
scientists conducting academic research

 passage 253
Certain practices common in the early United states make it easy for historians to underestimate 
the extent of American women’s paid labor. Under the legal principle called coverture, married 
women had no legally recognized economic existence apart from their husbands and could not 
receive wages for their work. Records of payments for outwork (work performed in the home on a 
piece-rate basis) show male names as wage recipients. One has to look in the columns recording 
the amount of work completed to see that female names are listed as producers. Furthermore, 
most wage laborers were paid partly in goods and received cash wages only quarterly or once or 
twice a year. The infrequency of such payments has sometimes made it difﬁcult for historians to 
recognize them as wages.
1. The passage suggests which of the following about records of payments for outwork?
A. They have only recently received attention from historians.
B. They could easily be misinterpreted by historians.
C. They have frequently been overlooked by historians.
D. They show a discrepancy between the amount of men’s and women’s wages.
E. They fail to reﬂect the infrequency of payments for completed work.
2. According to the passage, payments to wage laborers in the early United States were
A. usually lower for outwork than for other kinds of wage labor
B. consistently higher for male workers than for female workers
C. paid to male workers at more frequent intervals than to female workers
D. often paid partly in forms other than cash
E. often not recorded by employers
251


 passage 254
Bat studies in Indiana between 1961 and 1993 recorded bat roost locations. All of the roosts of 
evening bats were in buildings. Consequently, the fact that all evening bats radio-tracked since 
1993 have roosted in trees was notable. The building roosts may have been the result of spillover 
from large populations of evening bats in the woods along rivers, where, prior to 1993, scientiﬁc 
data were not collected. The building roosts may also indicate that this species had adapted well to 
human structures. However, the disappearance after 1993 of previously known roosts in buildings 
suggests that this adaptation became less successful. Big brown bat populations have been 
increasing in Indiana, and perhaps evening bats do not compete successfully with them for roosts 
in buildings.
1. The author mentions the fact that evening bats radio-tracked since 1993 have roosted in trees
primarily in order to
A. account for a puzzling aspect of evening bat behavior mentioned earlier in the passage
B. introduce evidence that indicates a change in evening bat behavior discussed later in the
passage
C. undermine a theory about evening bat behavior presented earlier in the passage
D. provide a contrast between evening bat behavior and big brown bat behavior
E. provide an example of evening bat behavior that ﬁts well-established scientiﬁc views of the
species
2. According to the passage, the disappearance after 1993 of known evening bat roosts in
buildings suggests which of the following?
A. After 1993 evening bats in Indiana were less likely to live near rivers.
B. Humans and their structures became increasingly threatening after 199C.
C. The spillover of large bat populations from woods near rivers increased after 199C.
D. Evening bats in Indiana inhabited the roosts previously used by big brown bats.
E. In Indiana, evening bats’ adaptation to buildings was ultimately undermined by other factors.
252


 passage 255
Witnesses to a meteor in Australia in 1978 claimed to have heard strange noises as it streaked 
overhead. Yet, given that the meteor was 30 kilometers up, if these sounds had come directly from 
the meteor, people on the ground could not have heard them until almost a minute after the meteor 
had disappeared. Physicist Colin Keay hypothesized that the light given off by a meteor’s trail must 
be accompanied by invisible electromagnetic radiation in the form of very low frequency (VLF) 
radio waves. Such waves, which travel at the speed of light, would reach the observer when the 
meteor itself came into view. 
Subsequent experiments in a soundproof chamber showed that many things can act as 
transducers to convert VLF waves into audible vibrations. Aluminum foil, thin wires, pine needles, 
or dry hair all responded to a VLF ﬁeld. VLF waves induce small charges in such objects, thereby 
causing them to vibrate in time with the waves’ oscillation. This transducer effect would explain 
why some people heard the noises while others close by heard nothing. Those who heard 
sounds were simply nearer to transducers. It could also explain why attempts to record meteor 
sounds have failed: scientists carefully place their microphones away from possible sources of 
interference. 
1. Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It explains why observers who were looking at the meteor would be the only ones who could
hear the sounds made as it went overhead.
B. It explains why the witnesses’ claims could not be veriﬁed by scientiﬁc experts.
C. It shows that Keay’s hypothesis provides the correct explanation of the sounds heard by
observers of the meteor.
D. It suggests that Keay’s hypothesis is capable of explaining an important aspect of the witnesses’
observations.
E. It suggests that Keay’s hypothesis is able to explain how observers can see a fast-moving
meteor.
2. The passage suggests that Keay formulated his hypothesis in response to
A. scientists’ failure to record meteor sounds
B. an inference based on the speed of sound in the atmosphere
C. measurements of the strength and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation from a meteor’s trail
D. the fact that observers who heard meteor sounds were close to objects that could act as
transducers of VLF waves
E. experiments in a soundproof chamber to determine what objects would transduce VLF waves
into audible vibrations
3. It can be inferred from the passage that if Keay’s proposed explanation of meteor sounds is
correct, it is true that
A. meteors themselves produce no audible vibrations, even though the meteor does cause the
sounds that observers hear
B. when an observer hears the sounds, it is his or her own hair that is causing the audible
vibrations
C. if two observers in widely separated locations hear sounds caused by the same meteor, the
audible vibrations that reach the observers are produced by different objects
D. visible light and VLF radio waves are the only forms of electromagnetic radiation that are given
off by a meteor’s trail
E. atmospheric conditions, such as clouds, that made a meteor invisible to observers on the
ground would also prevent those observers from hearing any sounds caused by that meteor
253


 passage 256
Larvae of many marine invertebrate species delay their metamorphosis into juveniles when cues 
signaling an appropriate juvenile environment are absent, thereby increasing their likelihood of 
thriving as juveniles and of ultimately reaching adulthood. Nevertheless, delayed metamorphosis 
has potential costs for juveniles, including reduced growth and increased mortality. Nearly all 
evidence of such costs involves species whose larvae do not feed but rather subsist on stored 
nutrients, indicating that insufﬁcient energy reserves may be an underlying cause of these costs. 
Supporting this hypothesis are laboratory studies showing that in a certain bryozoan, the prolonged 
larval swimming that results from delayed metamorphosis is associated with size reductions in the 
juvenile feeding organ (the lophophore) and that one factor inﬂuencing the size of juveniles of 
certain barnacle species is how long larvae delay metamorphosis.However, other studies show 
that while signiﬁcantly fewer juvenile Capitella worms survived to adulthood when metamorphosis 
had been delayed, prolonged larval swimming had no signiﬁcant effect on juvenile size, 
suggesting, perhaps, that in some species, factors other than insufﬁcient energy reserves account 
for the negative effects of the larval stresses that result from delayed metamorphosis. 
1. The passage suggests that the “bryozoan,” the “barnacle species,” and “Capitella worms” all
share which of the following characteristics?
A. The larvae of these species do not feed but rather subsist on stored nutrients.
B. The larvae of these species are unable to undergo metamorphosis if larval swimming is
signiﬁcantly prolonged.
C. The larvae of these species do not have enough energy to meet their needs when
metamorphosis is delayed.
D. The juveniles of these species manifest the negative effects of delayed metamorphosis as a
decrease in size.
E. The juveniles of these species are not signiﬁcantly larger than their respective larvae.
2. The “hypothesis” implies that compared to marine invertebrate larvae that subsist on stored
nutrients, marine invertebrate larvae that feed are less likely to
A. exhibit prolonged larval swimming as a result of delayed metamorphosis
B. experience negative effects as a result of delayed metamorphosis
C. thrive as juveniles in environments inappropriate for juveniles
D. delay metamorphosis in the absence of appropriate environmental cues
E. delay metamorphosis for an extended period of time
3. The passage is primarily concerned with
A. weighing the relative beneﬁts and costs of delayed metamorphosis
B. illustrating the range of costs that can result from delayed metamorphosis
C. speculating on why the costs of delayed metamorphosis have gone unrecognized
D. discussing a possible explanation of the costs of delayed metamorphosis
E. debunking the notion that the costs of delayed metamorphosis are negligible
254


 passage 257
The presence of work themes in the painting of the Impressionist movement of the late nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries has until recently been largely discounted, despite the body of 
Impressionist works that continued the tradition, initiated by Courbet and Millet and developed 
through the 1880s by Breton, Bastien-Lepage, Pissaro, and Berthe Morisot, of representing rural 
labor, and notwithstanding the signiﬁcant body of Impressionist work—including that of Degas, 
Caillebotte, and Morisot—representing urban or suburban labor. The notion of Impressionism as 
concerned primarily with the representation of leisure has less to do, however, with the subject 
matter of the paintings than with the acceptance of the view, widely held in nineteenth-century 
France, that considered peasants performing physically demanding rural labor as the epitome of 
work. The numerous Impressionist representations of activities (often those of women) that we 
might classify as work—a woman serving beer in a cafe, many paintings by Degas of the ballet (a 
physically demanding activity by any standard)—were instead classiﬁed as representations of 
leisure by those who held this view. 
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. propose a new theory about the techniques used to represent work themes in Impressionist
painting
B. expand the meaning of the term “work” as it applies to painting
C. note that work themes were often overlooked in Impressionist painting and suggest a reason
why
D. provide insight into why certain activities were not considered work in the late nineteenth
century
E. provide speciﬁc examples of rural work themes in Impressionist painting and explain the
signiﬁcance of such themes
2. The “tradition” refers to the
A. view that work themes are of little importance in Impressionist painting
B. representation of leisure
C. representation of urban and suburban labor
D. representation of rural labor
E. works of Degas, Caillebotte, and Morisot
3. With which of the following statements about Impressionist painting would the author of the
passage be most likely to agree?
A. The view that Impressionist painting is concerned primarily with themes of leisure is based in
part on a limited deﬁnition of what constitutes work.
B. Many Impressionist paintings once regarded as representing work themes are now viewed as
being concerned primarily with the representation of leisure.
C. Most of the Impressionist paintings that treat work themes depict activities representing urban
and suburban labor.
D. Although themes of work appear frequently in Impressionist paintings, these themes are limited
to the traditional representations of work as rural physical labor.
E. Notwithstanding the large body of Impressionist painting in which work themes are present, the
notion that Impressionist paintings are primarily about leisure activities is essentially correct.

 passage 258
The ship Mary Rose, ﬁrst launched in 1511, underwent extensive repairs in 1528 and 1536 and 
sank in 1543.  Researchers raised the ship in 1982 and analyzed the wreck’s preserved timbers; 
some timbers came from trees felled after 1511, so they must have been added during repair. 
There were some beams, however, that came from trees felled before 1511. It is likely, therefore, 
that these beams were part of the original ship.
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
A. The repair caused the Mary Rose to be signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult to handle and ultimately may
have led to the ship’s sinking.
B. The beams were fastened with wooden nails that came from trees felled after 151A.
C. The beams came from a part of the ship that quite commonly needs to be repaired every few
years.
D. One structurally important timber came from a tree felled after 1528.
E. Shipbuilders of the 1500s preferred to work with recently felled wood that was still green with
sap.
passage 259
Tea is rich in compounds called polyphenols, which are similar to certain compounds known to help 
prevent cancer. Among people in Japan, those who drink over ten cups of tea per day have lower 
rates of stomach cancer than others. On average, people in Japan drink much more tea than 
people in the United States and have lower rates of lung cancer. It is therefore likely that 
polyphenols also help prevent cancer.
Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the argument?
A. Smoking, a known cause of lung cancer, is more common in Japan than it is in the United
states.
B. Few people in the United States drink more than ten cups of tea per day.
C. Stomach cancer is much more common in Japan than it is in the United States.
D. Soy products, which are known to help prevent cancer, are more widely used in Japan than in
the United States.
E. Coffee, which like tea is a source of caffeine, is more popular in the United States than in Japan.
256


 passage 260
Few central Asian textiles from the Timurid period (1370-1526C. E.) have survived to be dated. 
However, scholars have long assumed that Timurid rugs with geometric patterns were replaced in 
royal courts by ﬂoral-patterned rugs only at the end of the 1400s, under the inﬂuence of the painter 
Behzād (circa 1455-circa 1536). Nevertheless, the presence of ﬂoral-patterned rugs in court 
scenes from two paintings in a 1440s Timurid manuscript suggests that ﬂoral-patterned rugs were 
already being used at that time. Whether the occasional presence of geometric rugs in similar 
paintings after the 1440s means the tradition of weaving rugs with geometric patterns also 
continued, or whether here the painters simply followed a well-established formula, is still 
an open question.
1. According to the passage, after the 1440s, Timurid paintings of court scenes
A. generally followed well-established formulas
B. are more likely to have survived than Timurid textiles
C. were greatly inﬂuenced by the painter Behzād
D. are frequently found in Timurid manuscripts
E. sometimes showed rugs with geometric patterns
2. The passage implies which of the following about the introduction of ﬂoral-patterned rugs in
Timurid royal courts?
A. It explains the absence of any surviving geometric-patterned rugs.
B. It predates any inﬂuence wielded by the painter Behzād.
C. It occurred earlier than scholars have long thought.
3. Which of the following statements best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the
context of the passage as a whole?
A. It notes a fact about Timurid rugs, that explains why they have been the subject of scholarly
controversy.
B. It emphasizes the fragility of central Asian textiles from the period in question,
C. It situates Timurid rugs within the wider context of textile arts from the same period.
D. It suggests why the author is relying upon indirect evidence for the dating of trends in Timurid
rugs.
E. It describes a constraint on the study of Timurid rugs that the author thinks has been
overemphasized.
4. In the context in which it appears, “formula” most nearly means
A. fact
B. symbol
C. ritual
D. maxim
E. recipe
257


 Passage 261
The sixteenth-century art historian Vasari wrote about a building only when he himself had seen it 
or a detailed model of it. The thorough description of the new chapel at Larcona contained in the 
second edition of Vasari’s Lives of the Artists    must have been contributed by someone else, 
since the edition was published the year before Vasari’s travels took him to Larcona, and no model 
of the chapel was ever shown in Florence, Vasari’s home.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A. Vasari discussed with his collaborators the new chapel at Larcona described in the second
edition of the book.
B. A model of the proposed chapel at Larcona was displayed in Rome, a city Vasari visited often.
C. There were many printings of the second edition of the book, all of them textually identical.
D. Vasari did not intend to provide in his book detailed descriptions of buildings outside of his
native Florence.
E. Most sections of the book are devoted to works of art and buildings of Vasari’s native Florence.
Passage 262
Setting conservation objectives often mixes scientiﬁc knowledge with political 
feasibility in such a way that one cannot tell where the science stops and the political 
pragmatism takes over. For example, Tear found that for endangered species with 
recovery plans, over a quarter of the plans set quantitative recovery objectives at or 
below the species’ existing population size or number of populations. Most likely 
these objectives were so low because they were politically palatable. Another 
possible explanation for such modest recovery objectives is what is known as the 
shifting-baseline syndrome. In this scenario, successive generations of wildlife 
managers use as their baseline the conditions they experienced at the start of their 
careers, resulting in lower expectations with each new generation.
1. In the context in which it appears, “modest” most nearly means
A. conventional
B. appropriate
C. unpretentious
D. difﬁdent
E. unambitious
2. According to the passage, the “shifting-baseline syndrome” is a result of which of
the following?
A. Modest recovery objectives determined by political pragmatism
B. The difﬁculty of determining existing population size and number of populations for
endangered species
C. Changes in the criteria that are used in determining whether a given quantitative
objective has been met
D. Each new generation of wildlife managers using recent conditions to set numerical
baselines for wildlife populations
E. The way that hopes for recovery of endangered species populations color the
expectations of successive generations of wildlife managers

 Passage 263
People who have low bone density have a markedly higher-than-average incidence of stroke, as 
do people with high blood pressure. There are well-known mechanisms by which high blood 
pressure can cause a stroke, but since it is highly unlikely that there are any mechanisms by which 
low bone density can cause a stroke, or vice versa, a possible hypothesis to account for the 
association between low bone density and stroke is that __________.
Which of the following most logically completes the argument?
A. a higher proportion of people with high blood pressure than of people with low bone density
have strokes
B. whatever causes low bone density in people protects them from high blood pressure
C. there is a condition that can cause both low bone density and strokes
D. those people with high blood pressure who take steps to lower it in order to prevent a stroke
generally take no steps to increase their bone density
E. there are few initial symptoms of high blood pressure or of low bone density
Passage 264
About 20 percent of professors at Torellia National University were not educated in Torellia. The 
average pay of professors at the university who were educated in Torellia is about 10 percent lower 
than that of professors with comparable levels of training and experience who were educated 
outside Torellia. These ﬁgures clearly indicate the existence of a university policy, though probably 
an unwritten one, of favoring foreign-educated professors over those educated in Torellia when 
determining salaries.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the editorials conclusion?
A. The salaries of professors at the university are increasing more slowly than the salaries of
people with comparable levels of training and experience employed by corporations.
B. The business school of the university, where most of the professors who were educated outside
Torellia teach, must pay high salaries to its faculty to compete with salaries available to them from
corporations.
C. The beneﬁts other than salary offered to the university’s professors are about the same for
professors educated in Torellia as for those not educated in Torellia.
D. The university has an explicit policy setting broad salary ranges for professors at all levels of
experience.
E. Most of the professors at the university who were educated outside Torellia are native-born
citizens of Torellia.
259


 Passage 265
Harriet Martineau’s Illustrations of Political Economy, a series of didactic novellas about 
industrialists and workers that were immensely popular upon their publication (1832-1834), are 
considered the ﬁrst industrial novels. But instead of foregrounding suffering individuals, as other 
industrial novels do, they champion the impersonal economic laws that determine individuals’ 
behavior. Martineau’s explicit aim is to convince her readers of the truth of the principles laid out by 
such economic philosophers as Thomas Malthus. Yet the novellas’ embrace of predetermined 
truths blunts their narrative force. Their claim to be “illustrations,” in which stories of human choice 
serve only to make vivid an abstract law, contravenes the relation in most realist ﬁction between 
abstract law and lived experience, in which the former is found inadequate to explain the latter. 
1. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about industrial novels written after
Martineau’s Illustrations of Political Economy   ?
A. They drew on the same subject matter as Illustrations of Political Economy    but approached
that subject matter with a different emphasis.
B. They were written by authors who aimed to capitalize on the popularity of Illustrations of Political
Economy.
C. They differed from Illustrations of Political Economy in that they were more directly concerned
with abstract economic laws than with the experiences of individuals.
D. They were more popular with readers than were Illustrations of Political Economy   .
E. They differed from Illustrations of Political Economy in that they tended to present industrialists
more sympathetically than workers.
2. The author of the passage mentions Thomas Malthus primarily to
A. cite a feature of Martineau’s writing that makes it particularly vivid
B. clarify a poorly understood aspect of Martineau’s ﬁction
C. explain Martineau’s intentions in writing Illustrations of Political Economy
D. contrast Martineau’s ﬁction with the writings of economic philosophers
E. help account for the popularity of Martineau’s Illustrations of Political Economy
260


 Passage 266
Nielsen is aware that for many readers, including the anthologists who create textbooks, African 
American literature is thought to be primarily realistic in style and sociological or political in content. 
Avant-garde expressions—beyond the obvious examples offered by Langston Hughes, Amiri 
Baraka, and Ishmael reed—are frequently overlooked. While such a narrow view is more readily 
apparent in critical attention given to ﬁction than in that given to poetry, it certainly skews 
anthologies. Nielsen is acutely aware of the serious political motives that often underlie such 
compilations and is also concerned that the currently popular critical paradigm of an oral tradition 
might deﬂect proper attention due African American literary traditions.
1. The passage suggests that compared with critical writing on African American ﬁction, critical
writing on African American poetry
A. is more often driven by serious political motives
B. is more inﬂuenced by currently popular critical paradigms
C. draws clearer distinctions between oral and literary traditions
D. acknowledges a broader range of style and content
E. focuses more on the sociological implications of the works discussed
2. The passage suggests that Nielsen has which of the following concerns regarding anthologies of
African American literature?
A. That the anthologies overlook the work of the important avant-garde writers Langston Hughes,
Amiri Baraka, and Ishmael Reed
B. That the anthologies focus on a particular type of literature at the expense of other types
C. That the anthologies give insufﬁcient attention to the oral tradition in African American literature
Passage 267
We take for granted that island populations must have a continental origin, and not the other way 
around. The number of islands that acquire their biota [i.e., plant and animal life] from a larger 
source supports this notion. There is, however, no fundamental mechanism in the equilibrium 
theory of island biogeography to preclude island species from colonizing the mainland. The belief 
in one-way biogeographic trafﬁc has only begun to erode as phylogenetic analyses have revealed 
island origins for continental rodents and lizards. Among plants, the genus Exostema has 
successfully diversiﬁed in the continental Neotropics, while two populations in the angiosperm 
genus Erithalis have colonized Florida. At least two Neotropical bat lineages can be added to the 
growing list of island-to-continent colonizers.
1. According to the passage, which of the following is true of the “equilibrium theory”?
A. It implies that very few island populations are able to colonize continental areas.
B. It can accommodate two-way biogeographic trafﬁc between islands and mainlands.
C. It necessarily assumes that island species originate on continents.
D. It has been undermined recently by phylogenetic analyses.
E. It questions the distinction between island and continental populations.
2. Select the sentence that presents a presupposition.
261


 Passage 268
The temperance movement, aimed at combating alcohol use, comprised the largest women’s 
movement and the largest group of women orators in nineteenth-century America. While the sheer 
quantity of material these women produced justiﬁes critical attention, their importance is by no 
means solely quantitative. Although they lacked formal rhetorical training, these women exhibited 
an exceptional understanding of language use within their cultural context and demonstrated 
remarkably effective rhetorical strategies in relation to their own purposes and the audiences they 
addressed. Despite the success that temperance activists had in creating change, twentieth-
century feminists tended to focus on the suffrage movement as women’s only signiﬁcant political 
act, an oversight that has resulted in a distortion of women’s participation in the political process.
1. In the context in which it appears, “critical” most nearly means
A. urgent
B. censorious
C. judgmental
D. scholarly
E. crucial
2. The passage suggests which of the following about the temperance movement’s audiences?
A. They were usually composed exclusively of women.
B. They were often persuaded by the speeches they heard by women temperance orators.
C. They were typically hostile to the idea of outlawing the use of alcohol.
D. They were more numerous in the beginning of the nineteenth century than they were at its end.
E. They were drawn largely from the same population as the audiences for women’s suffrage
groups.
Passage 269
It was recently discovered that the editors of a scholarly journal rejected a paper submitted for 
publication, even though expert reviewers had strongly recommended it. The editors said they had 
concerns about possible political reactions to this paper. This sorry episode shows that what many 
people have long suspected is true: that the journal routinely rejects papers on the basis of political 
rather than scholarly considerations.
The reasoning in the argument is open to criticism on the grounds that the argument
A. presumes that just because something happens frequently, it invariably happens
B. presumes that something is true simply on the grounds that many people think it
C. relies on evidence that contradicts the conclusion that is drawn
D. relies on a single example to establish a general claim
E. relies on claims made by people who are not experts in the ﬁeld
262


 Passage 270
A year ago, the government of Portran predicted that Torre City would experience strong net job 
growth for the following year but that Glanville, Portran’s other major city, would not. Events have 
clearly proved otherwise, however; in Torre City, but not in Glanville, the number of people who are 
unemployed is greater now than it was a year ago.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the editorial’s argument depends?
A. The unemployment rate is higher in Torre City than in Glanville.
B. The unemployment rate in Torre City is higher now than it has ever been.
C. Since making the prediction a year ago, the government of Portran has taken no steps to
improve job growth in the country.
D. Few, if any, unemployed people moved to Torre City from Glanville during the year.
E. Government predictions about the economy in Portran are generally not reliable.
Passage 271
In a ﬁve-year study of people with coronary heart disease, 85%percent of those given Artilase, a 
new drug developed as a treatment for coronary heart disease, were still alive at the end of the 
study. Since without Artilase only 75 percent of this group would have been expected to have lived 
the entire ﬁve years, Artilase is clearly effective in extending the lives of people with coronary heart 
disease.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument given?
A. Eighty-ﬁve percent of those in the study who were given a placebo (a medically ineffective but
harmless pill) rather than Artilase were still alive at the end of the study.
B. The study was funded by the manufacturers of Artilase.
C. The study did not include people whose coronary heart disease was so far advanced at the time
the study began that they were not expected to live more than one year.
D. At least 75 percent of the people in the study would have been expected to live an additional
ﬁve years or more had they undergone surgical treatment for their heart disease.
E. The study had originally been intended to last only four years.
263


 Passage 272
Writings by Renaissance artists are often prized for the light they can shed on artists’ lives and 
personalities. Despite their nearly equal life spans and impressive artistic output, 
Michelangelo, whose surviving writings are copious, is accessible in a way that Donatello is 
not. Other artists now less appreciated for their oeuvres, such as Cennino Cennini, are of greater 
value to modern historians for their written than for their painted output. The great paradox, 
however, is Leonardo da Vinci, who left thousands of pages of writing. These texts have been 
categorized for study, segmenting his body of writings into smaller groupings on subjects such as 
painting, science, anatomy, optics, and engineering. Yet despite the exhaustive application of this 
method, Leonardo, as an individual, remains thoroughly obscure. 
1. The author introduces the subject of Leonardo da Vinci primarily in order to
A. note an exception to the usefulness of a particular approach to studying Renaissance artists
B. emphasize the difﬁculty of interpreting the writings of Renaissance artists 
C. vindicate a particular approach to interpreting the work of Renaissance artists 
D. cite an artist whose writings have attracted particularly keen scholarly interest 
E. cast doubt on a particular assumption about the relationship of biography and painting
2. Which of the following best characterizes the function of the highlighted sentence?
A. It acknowledges an important exception to a particular generalization. 
B. It helps to account for a scholarly tendency mentioned earlier in the passage. 
C. It contrasts two kinds of evidence used in the study of Renaissance artists.
D. It provides an illustration of a point articulated in the preceding sentence. 
E. It notes an important distinction between the reputations of two Renaissance artists.
Passage 273
Arctic sea ice belongs to two categories. Seasonal ice freezes in winter and then dissolved in 
summer, while perennial ice perseveres year-round. To the untrained eye, all sea ice looks the 
same, but by licking it, one can evaluate how long a speciﬁc piece has been ﬂoating round. When 
ice starts to form in seawater, it drives out salt, which has no position in the crystal structure. As the 
ice gets thicker, the rejected salt collects in small pockets of brine too greatly concentrated to 
freeze. A piece of ﬁrst-year ice will taste salty. Finally, if the ice survives, these pockets of brine 
drain out through ﬁne, veinlike channels, and the ice becomes fresher; multiyear ice can even be 
dissolved and drunk.
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. The passage mentions which of the following as being a feature of seasonal ice?
A. It is similar in appearance to perennial ice.
B. It is typically ﬁlled with ﬁne, veinlike channels.
C. It tastes saltier than perennial ice.
2. In the context in which it appears, “ﬁne” most nearly means
A. acceptable
B. elegant
C. precise
D. pure
E. small

 Passage 274
The novel Georges, published under Alexander Dumas’ name, may actually have been written by 
Felicien Malleﬁlle. A comparison of Georges with well-known Dumas novels such as The Count of 
Monte Cristo suggests that Dumas had little to do with Georges. For example, Georges’ characters 
are tiresomely earnest, while those from Dumas’ well-known novels crack jokes and utter colorful 
oaths. Meanwhile, in a technical sense, Georges is well-written, while The Count of Monte Cristo, 
with all its verve and sparkle, is full of redundancies, repetitions, and non sequiturs. As Umberto 
Eco discovered while attempting to translate The Count of Monte Cristo, the charm of Dumas’ 
novel and its “narrative wisdom” are inseparable from its “linguistically sludgy and gasping” prose. 
1. The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements
about Dumas as a novelist? 
A. His use of non sequiturs detracts from the stylistic verve of his writing. 
B. His use of repetition has been overrated as effective novelistic technique.
C. His reliance on humor results in one-dimensional characters. 
D. His novels, while technically well written, have predictable plots.
E. His writing displays narrative skill despite certain technical ﬂaws.
2. According to the passage, which of the following is true regarding the novel Georges?
A. Its authorship was widely questioned soon after its publication. 
B. Its characters are less interesting than those in most Dumas novels. 
C. It is marred by redundancies, repetitions, and non sequiturs.
D. It presents unusual problems for translators. 
E. It has often been compared favorably to The Count of Monte Cristo
Passage 275
Pharmaceuticals imported into Bornland are inspected for quality to the extent that staff limitations 
permit. For the last few years, the proportion of shipments examined that have been found to be 
deﬁcient has been consistently around 25 percent. This year, the number of inspectors and 
inspections was doubled, and only 21 percent of shipments inspected were found deﬁcient. 
Clearly, therefore, the quality of pharmaceuticals being imported into Bornland has greatly 
improved. 
1. The answer to which of the following would be most helpful in evaluating this argument? 
A. What is the maximum ﬁne that the inspectors can impose when they ﬁnd that an importer’s
pharmaceutical shipments are of deﬁcient quality? 
B. Can the newly hired inspectors detect deﬁciencies in shipments at least as well as their more
experienced colleagues? 
C. Is Bornland currently a major exporter of pharmaceutical products? 
D. How many pharmaceutical companies import pharmaceuticals into Bornland? 
E. When did Bornland ﬁrst consider the hiring of additional inspectors for pharmaceutical imports?
265


 Passage 276
While studying different-sized ant colonies, Cole discovered that when there were only a few ants 
in the space provided, each individual exhibited a chaotic pattern of activity and rest. As the density 
of the colony increased by the addition of more ants, Cole observed a sudden transition to dynamic 
order: patterns of activity and rest over the colony as a whole suddenly changed from chaotic to 
rhythmic. Why should the density of ants play an apparently crucial role in the transition from 
chaotic to ordered behavior? Ants interact with one another, and an active ant encountering an 
inactive one will stimulate the latter into movement. At low densities there are few encounters, but 
at higher densities activity can spread like a contagion through the colony. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. According to the passage, which of the following statements about ant interactions is true? 
A. The interaction between active and inactive ants leads to a change in the inactive ant’s
behavior.
B. When the density of an ant colony is low, there are relatively few interactions between ants. 
C. When there are many ants in an ant colony, the perceived lack of space often leads ants to
inactivity.
2. In the context in which it appears, “ordered” most nearly means
A. prepared 
B. prearranged 
C. regular
D. peaceful
E. restricted
Passage 277
Spiders of the species Argiope build distinctive zig-zag patterns, called stabilimenta, into their 
webs. Recent research has established that Argiope spiders use stabilimenta to collect drinking 
water. This discovery, far from discrediting the long-standing hypothesis that stabilimenta serve to 
reinforce the webs, actually supports that hypothesis since ________. 
Which of the following, if true, most logically completes the argument? 
A. the source of the spiders’ drinking water is not rainwater but morning dew.
B. spiders would not make structures as energy-consuming as the stabilimenta are unless those
structures conferred some beneﬁt on the spiders
C. the role of stabilimenta in collecting drinking water was discovered independently of attempts to
verify the reinforcement hypothesis
D. a spider web designed to trap rather than shed water needs to be structurally stronger than one
that sheds water
E. the threads that make up the stabilimenta are as strong as the threads that make up the rest of
the web.
266


 Passage 278
A team of researchers has claimed that by drilling below the Earth’s surface, they have been able 
to recover microorganisms that inhabit depths where it was previously thought that no life existed. 
Although other microorganisms that were at ﬁrst thought to have been recovered from these 
depths were later determined merely to have come from surface soil, that cannot be so in this 
case, because ________. 
Which of the following most logically completes the argument? 
A. some of the microorganisms found by the researchers are incapable of living near the Earth’s
surface 
B. some of the microorganisms found by the researchers are known to inhabit the surface soil near
the researchers’ drilling site 
C. when drilling below the Earth’s surface, it is impossible to prevent contamination of the drill by
surface-soil microorganisms 
D. it is difﬁcult to keep microorganisms alive once they have been recovered from underneath the
Earth’s surface 
E. the drilling equipment used by the team of researchers was similar to drilling equipment used by
most previous teams of researchers investigating life below the surface of the Earth
Passage 279
In November 1753, the British author Sarah Fielding received half the payment for her novel The 
Cry and asked  that the other half, when due, go to her “or to whomsoever I shall appoint,” 
probably implying that the remaining share was purposed for someone else. In fact, many believe 
that the novel was a collaborative venture between Fielding and Jane Collier. This speciﬁc 
collaboration was likely enough, as the two were close friends with similar interests. They wrote 
jointly authored letters, were both published authors with a lively interest in each other’s work, and 
were passionate supporters of didacticism and innovation in ﬁction—core concerns of The Cry. 
However, contemporaries accredit the work solely to Fielding, and there is nothing in the novel that 
is incompatible with Fielding’s other writings.
For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. The passage presents which of the following as evidence in favor of Fielding and Collier’s
having collaborated in writing The Cry?
A. Their friendship
B. Their joint authorship of correspondence
C. Their approach to ﬁction
2. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would agree with which of the following claims
about The Cry?
A. It develops themes commonly found in published works.
B. It reﬂects an interest in the purposes to which ﬁction may be put.
C. It contains elements that are incompatible with any of Collier’s solo writings.
D. It shows that the extent of Collier and Fielding’s shared interests was not as wide as is generally
thought.
E. Parts of it were written jointly by Fielding and Collier.
267


 Passage 280
The Moon once had a magnetic ﬁeld, and Mars shows evidence of having had one early in its 
history, but neither object currently possess a magnetic ﬁeld. But Mercury, which is halfway in size 
between the Moon and Mars, has an active and relatively strong magnetic ﬁeld. Planetary 
scientists think that planets require a liquid core to sustain such a ﬁeld, but the smaller the planet, 
the faster it cools. Mercury, by all right, should have a core as cold and dead as the Moon’s, yet 
the magnetic ﬁeld persists. This may result from the presence of elements like sulfur that, when 
mixed with iron, lower the melting point and keep the core molten. 
1. The primary basis for the author’s use of the expression “by all right” is Mercury’s
A. size
B. early history
C. temperature
D. magnetic ﬁeld
E. chemical composition
2. In the context in which it appears, “dead” most nearly means
A. latent
B. inert 
C. dormant
D. deceased
E. obsolete
268


 Passage 281
Experts have disagreed about where the genus Varanus (monitor lizards) derived. Since most 
existing species live  in Australia, early researchers believed that Varanus originated in Australia 
and subsequently island hopped westward along the Indo-Australian archipelago. Herpetologist 
Robert Mertens later argued that Varanus possibly originated in the archipelago. Chromosomal 
analysis has since supported Mertens’ contention, and additionally, geologic evidence refers to a 
crash between the archipelago and the Australian landmass after Varanus originated—a fact that 
could account for the genus’ present distribution.
A relevant puzzle for scientists is the current distribution of Varanus’ largest surviv ing species, the 
Komodo dragon. These carnivores inhabited only on four small islands in the archipelago where, 
scientists note, the prey base is too small to support mammalian carnivores. But the Komodo 
dragon has recently been revealed to control body tem- perature much more efﬁciently than do 
mammalian carnivores, enabling it to survive on about a tenth of the food energy demanded by a 
mammalian carnivore of comparable size.
1. It can be inferred from the passage that the geographical distribution of the Komodo dragon is
A. currently less restricted than it was at the time researchers ﬁrst began investigating the origins
of the genus Varanus
B. currently more restricted than it was at the time researchers ﬁrst began investigating the origins
of the genus Varanus
C. less restricted than is the distribution of the genus Varanus as a whole
D. more restricted than is the distribution of the genus Varanus as a whole
E. viewed as evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the genus Varanus originated in the Indo-
Australian archipelago
2. Which of the following elements in the debate over the origin of Varanus is NOT provided in the
passage?
A. The evidence that led Mertens to argue that Varanus originated in the Indo-Australian archipelago
B. The evidence that led early researchers to argue that Varanus originated in Australia
C. A possible explanation of how Varanus might have spread to the Indo-Australian archipelago if it
had originated in Australia
D. A possible explanation of how Varanus might have spread to Australia if it had originated in the
Indo-Australian archipelago
E. An indication of the general present-day distribution of Varanus species between Australia and
the Indo-Australian archipelago
3. It can be inferred that which of the following is true of the “geologic evidence” ?
A. It was ﬁrst noted by Mertens as evidence in favor of his theory about the origins of Varanus.
B. It cannot rule out either one of the theories about the origins of Varanus discussed in the
passage.
C. It accounts for the present distribution of the Komodo dragon.
D. It has led to renewed interest in the debate over the origins of Varanus.
E. It conﬁrms the conclusions reached by early researchers concerning the origins of Varanus.
269


 Passage 282
For Temnothorax ants in search of suitable rock crevices for new nest sites, size is an important 
consideration, and certain behaviors suggest how scouts might compare the size of several sites. 
After entering a crevice, scouts invariably exit and reenter. During their ﬁrst inspection, they mark 
their route with their personal pheromones. (Experiments have shown that workers can distinguish 
their own pheromones from those of nest mates.) Some researchers believe that these ants are 
counting the frequency of intersections between their two exploratory trails. The smaller the area, 
the more likely they are to cross a spot twice. The observation that Temnothorax scouts always 
pave out a path of the same length on their ﬁrst visit to sites strongly supports this 
hypothesis.
1. In light of the claim made by the “researchers”, it can be inferred that ants’ ability to distinguish
their
A. own pheromones from these of nest mates is important primarily because ants would otherwise
be unable to tell whether potential mating sites were occupied by related colonies.
B. the ability aids in the assignment of speciﬁc tracks such as scouting for new nests, among the
various members of a nest.
C. ants who could not distinguish their own personal pheromones would be unable to tell if they
had previously embraced a site
D. pheromone differentiation is essential to account evaluation of potential nesting sites
E. pheromone differentiation is essential to ants’ ability to evaluate the size of crevices before
entering them
2. Which of the following best describe the function of the highlighted portion of the passage?
A. It clariﬁes the relationship between the scout ants’ behavior and the quality of a potential nesting
site.
B. It offers a hypothesis to explain why ants make only two trips through each potential nesting site
C. It attempts to reconcile the behavior of scout ants with the nesting locations eventually chosen
by their colonies
D. It challenges the conclusion of researchers about scout ants ‘speciﬁc behavior
E. It undermines observations of former experiments about Temnothorax ant’s ability to distinguish
pheromones
270


 Passage 283
If a supernova (the explosion of a massive star) triggered star formation from dense clouds of gas 
and dust, and if the most massive star to be formed from the cloud evolved into a supernova and 
triggered a new round of star formation, and so on, then a chain of star-forming regions would 
result. If many such chains were created in a differentially rotating galaxy, the distribution of stars 
would resemble the observed distribution in a spiral galaxy.
This line of reasoning underlies an exciting new theory of spiral-galaxy structure. A computer 
simulation based on this theory has reproduced the appearance of many spiral galaxies without 
assuming an underlying density wave, the hallmark of the most widely accepted theory of the large-
scale structure of spiral galaxies. That theory maintains that a density wave of spiral form sweeps 
through the central plane of a galaxy, compressing clouds of gas and dust, which collapse into 
stars that form a spiral pattern.
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. describe what results when a supernova triggers the creation of chains of star-forming regions
B. propose a modiﬁcation in the most widely accepted theory of spiral-galaxy structure
C. compare and contrast the roles of clouds of gas and dust in two theories of spiral-galaxy structure
D. describe a new theory of spiral-galaxy structure and contrast it with the most widely accepted
theory
E. describe a new theory of spiral-galaxy structure and discuss a reason why it is inferior to the
most widely accepted theory
2. The passage implies that, according to the new theory of spiral-galaxy structure, a spiral galaxy
can be created by supernovas when the supernovas are
A. producing an underlying density wave
B. affected by a density wave of spiral form
C. distributed in a spiral pattern
D. located in the central plane of a galaxy
E. located in a differentially rotating galaxy
3. Which of the following, if true, would most discredit the new theory as described in the passage?
A. The exact mechanism by which a star becomes a supernova is not yet completely known and
may even differ for different stars.
B. Chains of star-forming regions like those postulated in the new theory have been observed in
the vicinity of dense clouds of gas and dust.
C. The most massive stars formed from supernova explosions are unlikely to evolve into
supernovas.
D. Computer simulations of supernovas provide a poor picture of what occurs just before a
supernova explosion.
E. A density wave cannot compress clouds of gas and dust to a density high enough to create a
star.
271


 Passage 284
In the mid-seventeenth century, some Native Americans in colonial New England started to keep 
and manage livestock for the ﬁrst time, doing so according to their own cultural priorities and 
interests. Several factors inﬂuenced their decision to keep animals, including threats to their land 
base and to the productivity of their hunting. It might appear that animal husbandry as practiced by 
Europeans would have posed an insurmountable sociocultural challenge for Indians. Scholars 
studying the issue have argued that livestock would have compromised the mobility 
needed for winter hunting, destroyed crops, competed with wild game for resources, and 
violated prevailing conceptions of property and of human-animal interconnectedness. Such 
obstacles were indeed difﬁcult, but creative ways to overcome them were found.
1. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the highlighted sentence? 
A. It identiﬁes an atypical scholarly viewpoint regarding Native Americans and animal husbandry.
B. It helps to explain why animal husbandry was not adopted by more Native Americans in colonial
New England. 
C. It points out some of the typical misconceptions that scholars have regarding Native Americans
in colonial New England. 
D. It identiﬁes factors that ultimately transformed the Native American way of life. 
E. It identiﬁes certain challenges that practicing animal husbandry posed for Native Americans in
colonial New England.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. It can be inferred that the author would agree with which of the following statements about
animal husbandry by Native Americans in colonial New England? 
A. Its adoption required some cultural adjustment by Native American societies. 
B. Its inﬂuence eventually led to changes in the husbandry practices used by Europeans in the
regions.
C. It may have allowed those who adopted it to compensate, in whole or in part, for reduced
hunting yields.
272


 Passage 285
Analyzing the physics of dance can add fundamentally to a dancer’s skill. Although dancers 
seldom see themselves totally in physical terms —as body mass moving through space under the 
inﬂuence of well-known forces and obeying physical laws—neither can they afford to ignore the 
physics of movement. For example, no matter how much a dancer wishes to leap off the ﬂoor and 
then start turning, the law of conservation of angular momentum absolutely prevents such a 
movement.
Some movements involving primarily vertical or horizontal motions of the body as a whole, in which 
rotations can be ignored, can be studied using simple equations of linear motion in three 
dimensions. However, rotational motions require more complex approaches that involve analyses 
of the way the body’s mass is distributed, the axes of rotation involved in different types of 
movement, and the sources of the forces that produce the rotational movement.
1. The author mentions all of the following as contributing to an understanding of the physics of
dance EXCEPT
A. the law of conservation of angular momentum
B. analyses of the way in which the body’s mass is distributed
C. equations of linear motion in three dimensions
D. analyses of the sources that produce rotational motions
E. the technical terms for movements such as leaps and turns
2. Analysis of which of the following would require the kind of complex approach described in the
last sentence?
A. A long leap across space
B. A short jump upward with a return to the same place
C. A sustained and controlled turn in place
D. Short, rapid steps forward and then backward without turning
E. Quick side steps in a diagonal line
273


 Passage 286
The most believable justiﬁcation for higher taxes on automobile fuel is that fuel consumption 
diminishes the environment and thus increases the costs of trafﬁc congestion. But the fact that 
burning fuel generates these “negative externalities” does not indicate that no tax on fuel 
could ever be too high. Economics is accurate about the tax that should, in principle, be levied to 
cope with negative externalities: the tax on a liter of fuel should equals the harm resulted from 
using a liter of fuel. If the tax is more than that, its costs (including the inconvenience to those who 
would rather have used their cars) will exceed its beneﬁts (including any reduction in congestion 
and pollution).
1. In the last sentence, “exceed” most closely means
A. outstrip
B. magnify
C. delimit
D. offset
E. supplant
2. Which of the following best features the function of the indicated portion of the passage?
A. It restates a point made earlier in the passage.
B. It provides the evidence on which a theory is based.
C. It presents a speciﬁc application of a general principle.
D. It summarizes a justiﬁcation with which the author disagrees.
E. It suggests that the beneﬁts of a particular strategy have been overestimated.
Passage 287
The national crime rate has been declining, but television news coverage of crime has been 
increasing. Many media analysts hold that the increasing emphasis on crime is making viewers 
more mistrustful of others and more afraid of crime. To support this position, they cite survey 
results that show that the people most likely to be mistrustful of others and to overestimate the 
crime rate are those who watch the most television.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the support provided by the survey results 
for the media analysts’ position?
A. There are many people who are deeply mistrustful of others and watch little or no television.
B. Most people who have themselves been victims of a crime overestimate the crime rate and are
mistrustful of others.
C. Among people who say that they are not mistrustful of others, the great majority say that they
believe that when an individual event is portrayed on television, it is portrayed accurately.
D. Most people who watch television news on a regular basis say that they ﬁnd crime stories more
interesting than most other kinds of stories.
E. People who are unusually suspicious and particularly afraid of crime tend to stay home watching
television more than do people who are not.
274


 Passage 288
Only since the Second World War has graphic design been categorized as a ﬁeld worth knowing 
about and preserving, and most design collections have been narrowly deﬁned. There are few 
extant archives of advertisements, some design collections include only political posters by 
established artists, other collections focus on such speciﬁc historical documents as election 
posters. Rigidly deﬁned collections like these can foster pigeonholed concepts of design 
history. In contrast, Merrill Berman’s ambitious reach as a collector- one that includes avant-
graphics, anonymous political posters, and commercial advertisements- preserves graphics in a 
wide range to show how graphic designs pervade a culture, not in isolation from on another but all 
mixed together part of the daily inundation of meanings and visual stimulation. 
Which of the following best describes the function of the highlight sentence 
A. It offers a critique of the design collections referenced in the preceding sentence 
B. It questions the motivation behind Berman’s graphic design collection 
C. It illustrates why graphic design was not viewed as an important ﬁeld of study before the Second
World War 
D. It identiﬁes an understanding of design history that informed Berman’s early career 
E. It supports an argument against Berman’s eclectic approach to collecting
Passage 289
During the early nineteenth century, the demand for ever-louder sound led to ever-increasing 
tension on piano strings, making evident the need for stronger framing. Sooner or later, long after 
factories had taken over the manufacture of other commodities, the Industrial Revolution 
nevertheless shaped the attitudes of those who decided whether to accept this innovation. To build 
pianos with steam-powered tools was one thing, to put a cast-iron frame at the center of the 
instrument, making the product itself a modern factory of sound rather than a fully handcrafted 
artwork, in wood, was quite another. The resulting debate was vigorous, with many feeling certain 
that iron in the piano would ruin the tone. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. Which of the following statements about the development of the piano can be inferred from the
passage?
A. Pianos continued to be made by artisans well into the nineteenth century.
B. The use of steam-powered tools in piano making led to a decline in tone quality.
C. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the framing in piano was made entirely of wood.
2. In the context in which it appears, “tone” most exactly means
A. interval
B. mood
C. timbre
D. pitch
E. shade
275


 Passage 290
Virtually everyone who speaks Torvic lives in Torvia, a small country that takes pride in its unique 
culture. Since Torvia trades with many other countries, however, most people who live in Torvia 
speak several languages, and many languages are taught in Torvia’s public schools. Nevertheless, 
from these facts it should not be inferred that most speakers of Torvic speak several languages, 
because ________.
Which of the following most logically completes the argument? 
A. very few languages are as difﬁcult to learn as a second language as Torvic is 
B. of all the people in the world who speak several languages, only a small minority speak Torvic 
C. few people who live in Torvia actually speak Torvic 
D. few people who live in Torvia have ever lived outside Torvia 
E. some of the languages taught in Torvia’s public schools are not spoken in any of the countries
with which Torvia trades
276


 Passage 291
During the 1920s, most proponents of scientiﬁc management, Frederick Taylor’s approach for 
maximizing workers’ productivity by intensively routinizing their jobs, antagonized the ﬁve-day 
workweek. Despite scientiﬁc managers conceded that decreasing hours might supply an incentive 
to workers, in practice they more often utilized pay differentials to encourage higher productivity. 
Those reformers who wanted to accept both scientiﬁc management and reduced hours had to 
make a greatly negative case, depicting the latter as an antidote to the rigors of the former. In 
conﬂict to the scientiﬁc managers, Henry Ford stated that shorter hours caused larger productivity 
and proﬁts. However, few employers matched either Ford’s vision or his particular interest in mass 
marketing a product—automobiles—that requested leisure for its use, and few unions succeeded 
in saving shorter hours through bargaining. At its 1928 convention, the American Federation of 
Labor (AFL) boasted of approachingly 165,000 members working ﬁve-day, 40-hour weeks. 
But even though this represented an raise of about 75,000 since 1926, about 70 percent of the 
entire came from ﬁve enormously well-organized building trades’ unions.
1. The passage is primarily concerned with discussing which of the following?
A. The relative merits of two points of view regarding a controversy
B. The potential beneﬁts to workers in the 1920s of a change in employers’ policies
C. The reasons for a labor-management disagreement during the 1920s
D. The status of a contested labor issue during the 1920s
E. The role of labor unions in bringing about a reform
2. It can be inferred that the author of the passage mentions “automobiles” primarily to suggest that
A. Ford’s business produced greater proﬁts than did businesses requiring a workweek longer than
ﬁve days
B. Ford, unlike most other employers, encouraged his employees to use the products they produced
C. Ford may have advocated shorter hours because of the particular nature of his business
D. unions were more likely to negotiate for shorter hours in some businesses than in others
E. automobile workers’ unions were more effective than other unions in securing a ﬁve-day
workweek
3. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would probably agree with which of the
following claims about the boast highlighted?
A. It is based on a mistaken estimation of the number of AFL workers who were allowed to work a
ﬁve-day, 40-hour week in 1928.
B. It could create a mistaken impression regarding the number of unions obtaining a ﬁve-day, 40-
hour week during the 1920s.
C. It exaggerates the extent of the increase between 1926 and 1928 in AFL members working a
ﬁve-day, 40-hour week.
D. It overestimates the bargaining prowess of the AFL building trades’ unions during the 1920s.
E. It is based on an overestimation of the number of union members in the AFL in 1928.
4. According to the passage, the “reformers” claimed that
A. neither scientiﬁc management nor reduced hours would result in an improvement in the working
conditions of most workers
B. the impact that the routinization of work had on workers could be mitigated by a reduction in the
length of their workweek
C. there was an inherent tension between the principles of scientiﬁc management and a
commitment to reduced workweeks
D. scientiﬁc managers were more likely than other managers to use pay differentials to encourage
higher productivity
E. reducing the length of the workweek would increase productivity more effectively than would
increases in pay
277


 Passage 292
Unlike the static, classically composed portraits produced by her mentor Walker Evans, twentieth- 
century New York photographer Helen Levitt’s photographs seem candid and spontaneous. 
Whereas Evans’ subjects look directly into the camera, so that photographer and subject conspire 
in the making of a portrait, Levitt’s subjects seem caught unawares. As a “street” photographer, 
before the term’s invention, Levitt has claimed to have attempted to capture life as she found it. But 
there is a paradox to her technique. Her off-the-cuff aesthetic seemingly guarantees objectivity, 
since she was recording street scenes she happened upon, yet her photographs could be said to 
be highly subjective, to be reﬂections of Levitt’s own distinctive preoccupations and ways of seeing. 
Unlike Evans’ images, Levitt’s are solely the products of the photographer without the conscious 
participation of their subjects. The repetitions evident in Levitt’s choices of subjects, for example, 
her many photographs of children in masks and disguises, reveal more about Levitt herself than 
about those subjects. 
1. According to the passage, which of the following appears to ensure the objectivity of Levitt’s
photographs?
A. She took photographs in public places rather than in a studio.
B. She was not personally acquainted with the subjects of her photographs.
C. She did not arrange the scenes or pose the subjects she photographed.
D. She avoided using classical principles of composition.
E. She was guided by her subjects’ preoccupations rather than by her own.
2. The passage asserts which of the following about Evans’ portrait photographs?
A. Evans’ photographs indicate a conscious rejection of the approaches associated with street
photography.
B.The subjects in an Evans’ photograph become collaborators in the portrait’s creation. 
C. Evans’ photographic portraits usually reveal more about Evans than they do about his subjects.
D. Evans’ static, classically composed portraits reveal Evans’ preoccupation with maintaining an
appearance of objectivity.
E. Evan’s static, classically composed portraits reveal little about his distinctive way of seeing.
3. The passage suggests which of the following about street photography?
A. It characteristically depicts groups of people rather than individual subjects.
B. It tends to depict a narrow and repetitious range of subject matter. 
C. It creates the impression of spontaneity but often actually involves scenes contrived by the
photographer. 
D. Its early practitioners were not accorded much recognition for their aesthetic achievements.
E. It had not been named as such when Levitt began practicing this kind of photography.

 Passage 293
United State women won the vote in 1920 after decades of campaigning. Yet, the impact on 
women’s status was more limited than women’s rights activists had anticipated. Women were 
granted suffrage at a historical point when voting was no longer a signiﬁcant political activity for 
many Americans. In the mid-nineteenth century, when women ﬁrst sought suffrage rights, voter 
turnout rates were unprecedentedly high, elections in much of the country very competitive, and 
political parties important. But when women ﬁnally received the vote in 1920, electoral politics was 
largely noncompetitive, with virtual one-party rule in many areas, and voter turnout had slipped to 
its all-time low. Nonetheless, the vote still mattered enough for women to seek it and for 
conservatives to try to restrict its availability. 
1. The author of the passage discusses voter turnout rates primarily in order to
A. conﬁrm an assumption about the impact of women suffrage on united states electoral politics
B. explain a signiﬁcant change in American political life that occurred over the course of the
campaign for woman suffrage
C. account for changes in the importance of political parties between the mid-nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries.
D. Identify a reason elections were less competitive after 1920 than they had been in earlier
decades.
E. Illustrate a point about the importance of political parties in the mid-nineteenth century
2. The author of the passage mentions conservatives in the highlighted sentence primarily in order
to
A. account for long lag between the beginning of the woman suffrage movement and the
achievement of voting rights for women
B. suggest that political parties had a larger role in opposing woman suffrage than has sometimes
been acknowledged
C. conﬁrm that the attaining of woman suffrage was politically important in spite of a national
devaluation of voting
D. identify a reason that the granting of voting rights to women had less political impact than
women’s rights activists hoped
E. argue that women’s votes had a greater impact on United States electoral politics than was
previously believed.

 Passage 294
Some studies have shown that red-backed salamanders (RBS) are scarce in areas with 
acidic soils and that those present in such conditions have smaller-than-average bodies. 
Explanations have included the possibility that young RBS are adversely affected by acidic soil, 
that adult RBS can sense and may avoid acidic soil conditions, or that loss of RBS prey 
populations due to acidic soil could result in reduced RBS populations. Yet researchers found fairly 
high densities of large- bodied RBS at Lake Claire Watershed, where soil conditions are acidic. 
One hypothesis is that intraspeciﬁc geographical variation in acidity tolerance (i.e., local adaptation 
to an acidic environment) could exist for RBS. Previous studies showed potential local adaptation 
of some salamander species to acidity. 
1. Which of the following can be inferred about the studies mentioned in the highlighted portion of
the passage? 
A. They may have undercounted RBS in their study areas due to faulty methodology. 
B. They focused less on adult RBS than on RBS in the early stages of their development.
C. They found evidence that acidic conditions adversely affect the prey on which RBS depend. 
D. They drew unsubstantiated conclusions about the possible adverse effects of acidic conditions
on RBS. 
E. They were conducted in areas where the soil conditions were similar to those at Lake Claire
Watershed.
2. The primary purpose of the passage is to 
A. cite evidence that appears to contradict a widely held assumption 
B. present contrasting interpretations of a particular research ﬁnding 
C. explain how a particular environmental change can produce diverse outcomes 
D. note an unexpected ﬁnding and summarize new possible explanation for it 
E. identify a correlation and explain why one hypothesis about it is more persuasive than others
passage 295
Tropical forests typically have many more species of plants and animals than do temperate forests 
of comparable size. During the Ice Age, forests in temperate regions were destroyed, while those 
in the tropics were not. Accordingly, one proposed explanation of this difference in the number of 
species is that tropical forests typically had a much longer period than temperate forests in which 
different species could take hold. 
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the proposed explanation? 
A. The greater warmth of tropical forests enables them to sustain a greater density of plants and
animals than temperate forests can. 
B. There is virtually no overlap between the species that are found in tropical forests and those
found in temperate forests.
C. Some areas that were temperate forests before the Ice Age are no longer forested.
D. The number of plants and animal species is no greater in tropical forests that have arisen since
the Ice Age than in temperate forests of comparable size. 
E. A change in climate tends to increase the rate at which new species become established in a
region.

 Passage 296
Federal courts in the United States, especially before the famous 1962 case of Baker v. Carr, were 
often thought to be powerless in the area of election law, voting rights, and other legal questions 
clearly bearing on politics. This perception was not entirely correct, of course, as pre-1962 
Supreme Court decisions such as that in the case of Smith v. Allwright demonstrated in the wake of 
that decision, voting participation among African Americans in the South increased substantially. 
However, political rights had not always been so clearly championed by the Supreme Court as they 
were in Smith v. Allwright. Indeed, the transformations between the Civil War and 1962 were such 
that, in reviewing voters’ rights cases over the intervening decades, one feels like an archaeologist 
cutting through distinct layers in which the judicial decisions uncovered reveal a pattern of 
ideological and societal change. 
1. The author of the passage uses the analogy of the archaeology most probably in order to
A. contrast judicial decisions made after 1962 concerning voters rights with decision made
immediately after the Civil War
B. suggest that the author is perplexed by many judicial decisions regarding voters’ rights
C. characterize the nature of change in judicial thinking regarding voters’ rights
D. indicate that much of the history of voters’ rights has been lost since the Civil War
E. illustrate the lack of concern for voters’ rights exhibited by federal courts before the Civil
War
2. Which of the following can be inferred regarding the case of Baker v. Carr? 
A. Its outcome required clariﬁcation in subsequent decisions rendered by the Supreme Court.
B. Its resolution attested to the power of federal courts to address legal issues related to politics.
C. It marked a radical change in judicial thinking in the United States.
D. It was decided before the Supreme Courts heard the case of Smith v. Allwright.
E. It has little historical signiﬁcance aside from its focus on laws affecting politics.

 Passage 297
In A Fine Brush on Ivory, his appreciation of novelist Jane Austen, Richard Jenkyns remarks that 
in Austen scholarship, there are pressure that cause ordinary critical circumspection to break 
down. Principal among those pressures is the peculiar affection in which the person of Jane Austen 
is held by many readers. This affection is not altogether explained by admiration for he genius, nor 
is it entirely a symptom of nostalgia for her orderly, decorous, even mysterious life. Writer has led 
critics to approach her work in mostly biographical or historical ways, often in deﬁance of other 
critical fashions, especially the various formal approaches that have dominated modern literary 
criticism. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. According to the passage, critics approach Jane Austen’s work in biographical or historical ways
for which of the following reasons?
A. They ﬁnd her work particularly well suited to biographical and historical readings.
B. They are unsatisﬁed with the formal approaches that have dominated modern literary criticism.
C. They feel the need to know the bafﬂing writer personally. 
2. In the context in which it appears, “appreciation of” most nearly means
A. gratitude toward
B. awareness of
C. appraisal of
D. esteem for
E. grasp of
Passage 298
The traditional color of ﬁre trucks is red, but in cities that have introduced yellow trucks into their 
ﬂeets, the rate of trafﬁc accidents per mile driven among these trucks has been far lower than the 
rate among red trucks. Some critics of the innovation have questioned whether this difference 
should be attributed to color, given that the yellow trucks were generally newer than the red      
trucks with which they were compared. But this criticism can be dismissed. Certainly, the mere 
difference in accident rates is not decisive evidence. The decisive fact is that the rates differed 
signiﬁcantly only in the hours around dawn and dusk. At these hours, the visibility of yellow is 
known to be better than that of red. 
In the argument given, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles? 
A. The ﬁrst is a statement of the position the argument as a whole opposes; the second is a
statement of the position it defends.
B. The ﬁrst is a claim that the argument as a whole calls into question; the second denies the
rationale presented by some critics of that claim.
C. The ﬁrst is a claim that the argument as a whole calls into question; the second points out an
error of reasoning made by defenders of that claim.
D. The ﬁrst is the position defended in the argument; the second is an intermediate conclusion
drawn to support that position.
E. The ﬁrst is the position defended in the argument; the second concedes a point to critics of that
position.

 Passage 299
Findings in biological anthropology suggest that Native Americans’ ancestors probably came to the 
Americas from northeastern Asia. Turner, for example, has studied the dentition of prehistoric and 
living Native Americans and northeastern Asians. Based on approximately twenty dental traits, 
including tooth-crown shape and number of roots, he has deﬁned an overall dental pattern called 
Sinodonty, which includes three-rooted lower ﬁrst molars and shovel-shaped incisors. This 
distinctive pattern is shared among most Native Americans and people from northeastern Asia, but 
is not found in people who originated in southern Asia, Africa, or Europe. Another less complex 
pattern—Sundadonty—is shared among the people of southeastern Asia and is also found in 
prehistoric American populations, but Turner believes that widespread Sinodonty demonstrates 
most Native Americans’ northeastern Asian origins. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. The passage implies that Turner’s conclusion regarding the origins of most Native American
populations is based in part on which of the following ﬁndings? 
A. The presence of Sundadonty among prehistoric American populations
B. The prevalence od shovel-shaped incisors among Native Americans 
C. The absence of Sinodonty among people from southern Asia, Africa, and Europe.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. According to the passage, Sinodonty and Sundadonty differ from one another in that Sinodonty
A. has been found among prehistoric Native American populations, while Sundadonty has not.
B. is a more complex dental pattern than Sundadonty is
C. occurs frequently in modern Native American populations, while Sundadonty does not.

 Passage 300
Belnovia’s government provides health care to all its citizens Five years ago, with costs incurred 
from smoking-related health problems accounting for 5 percent of annual government 
expenditures, Belnovia’s health agency initiated a nationwide antismoking campaign. Although the 
campaign succeeded in reducing the number of smokers in Belnovia substantially, it clearly failed 
to reduce the annual costs incurred from smoking-related health problems, since these costs 
currently account for 6 percent of annual government expenditures. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A. Costs incurred from smoking-related health problems account for a greater portion of the
Belnovian government’s overall health expenditures now than they did ﬁve years ago.
B. The average cost of treatment for smoking related health problems in Belnovia has not
increased signiﬁcantly over the past ﬁve years.
C. Overall health expenditure account for a greater portion of the Belnovian government’s annual
expenditures now than they did ﬁve years’ ago
D. Belnovia’s annual government expenditures are not signiﬁcantly lower now than they were ﬁve
years ago.
E. Smoking-related health problems usually persist long after a person has quit smoking

Passage 301
Edith Wharton's reputation may be secure, but it is the wrong kind of reputation: she is celebrated 
as a novelist concerned with elegant surfaces and manners. Critics have misunderstood the 
nature of her contribution to modern ﬁction largely because they misperceive her subject matter 
as genteel and eﬀete. Even sympathetic critics fail to acknowledge the extent to which 
Wharton challenged contemporary mores. Between her early novel. The House of Mirth (1905) 
and her last, The Buccaneers (1938),Wharton addressed subjects that many might think of as 
decidedly un-Whartonesque, including marital strife and rural and urban poverty. Yet she remains 
ﬁrmly enshrined as a scion of rareﬁed.upper-class America, an image reinforced by Martin 
Scorsese’s sumptuous 1993 ﬁlm adaptation of The Age of Innocence. 
1. The author would most likely agree with which of the following statements about Scorsese's 
ﬁlm adaptation of The Age of Innocence? 
A. It is not as true to the novel as are other ﬁlm adaptations of Wharton's works 
B. It has encouraged a misguided impression of Wharton and her work. 
C. It was based on a highly unusual interpretation of The Age of Innocence 
D. It did some damage to Wharton's reputation as a major ﬁgure in modern ﬁction. 
E. It spent too much time dwelling on subject matter that many would consider un-Whartonesque. 
2. The author implies which of the following about the challenge referred to in the highlighted 
sentence? 
A. It goes against the main current of modern ﬁction. 
B. It has recently become a matter of scholarly controversy. 
C. It became bolder and more pronounced at the end of Wharton’s career. 
D. It does not manifest itself in Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence. 
E. It spanned all or nearly all of Wharton's writing career. 


Passage 302
While captive orangutans learn to use tools, wild orangutans have not been observed doing so 
until recently when researchers witnessed orangutans near Suaq Balimbing in Sumatra using tools 
to extract insects from tree holes and seeds from the Neesia fruitWhat explains this population's 
tool use? It is doubtful that the Suaq orangutans are intrinsically smarter: captive orangutans have 
demonstrated that the species has the brain capacity to use tools. Another explanation is 
environmental. While previously studied orangutans mostly inhabited dry forests, the Suaq 
orangutans inhabit a lush swamp where insects ﬂourish in tree holes and Neesia fruit is abundant. 
However, orangutans in other habitats where Neesia grows do harvest the seeds, but without 
tools they obtain fewer than do the Suaq orangutans. 
1. The passage mentions "orangutans in other habitats where Neesia grows" primarily in orderto 
A. explain why orangutans living in dry forests apparently do not use tools to obtain foods 
B. propose an alternative to the environmental explanation for Suaqorangutans' tool use 
C. demonstrate how environment may inﬂuence orangutan populations' brain capacity 
D. contrast the food preferences of the Suaq orangutans with those of orangutans living in other 
habitats 
E. Suggest that the Suaq orangutans' tool use cannot be explained merely by the availability of 
certain foods in their habitat
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. The passage suggests which of the following about orangutans that live mostly in dry forests? 
A. They probably use some tools, though this tool use has not been observed by researchers 
B. They dislike the foods that the orangutans living near Suaq Balimbing prefer. 
C. They probably have the same capacity for tool use as have orangutans living near Suaq 
Balimbing. 


Passage 303
In 431 B.C. several hundred cavalry soldiers received a state burial outside the gates of Athens. 
Archaeologists excavating at the location of these gates found the bones of hundreds of men that 
dated to the period of the funeral. There are other gravesites in the area; however, examination of 
the bones in question indicates that the men frequently rode horses, as would be true of cavalry 
soldiers. Therefore, the bones are probably those of the soldiers, since _______. 
Which of the following most logically completes the argument? 
A. there are no historical records of any state burial of foot soldiers in that location around that 
period 
B. none of the other gravesites in the area contain the bones of women, who were not permitted 
to be soldiers in ancient Athens  
C. few Athenian men who lived during that period rode horses frequently 
D. none of the bones at the gravesite are those of horses 
E. ancient historians do not provide speciﬁc enough descriptions to enable archaeologists to 
pinpoint the burial's exact location 


passage 304
In 1886 approximately 20 percent of United States workers belonged to the Knights of Labor, a 
labor-activist fraternal order. Nonetheless, soon after reaching this peak, the Knights membership 
began a rapid decline, and the organization never regained its national prominence. This collapse 
had wide-ranging repercussions: subsequent worker organizations took a less active and less 
broad-based organizational approach. The Knights' defeat demoralized those who championed 
radical reform and the organization of workers as a class, while empowering those who 
promoted a less inclusive strategy. 
Current scholarship has tended to attribute the Knights calamitous decline to two factors: 
persistent tension between skilled and unskilled workers, and ﬁerce opposition from employer 
associations, which used extralegal means to undermine unions. Voss examined both factors and 
found that employer associations’ opposition, not conﬂict among the Knights, led to the Knights' 
rapid decline. But Voss's account fails to explain why the Knights succumbed so easily when 
other union movements thrived. It seems that the Knights' particular organizational structure 
prompted factional disputes among members and, more important, that competition from rival 
trade and fraternal organizations lured members away. While dissension within the order might 
not itself have suﬃced to cause its demise, the profusion of organizational alternatives during this 
period induced mass defection, and, subsequently, the transformation of the American labor 
movement. 
1. The author would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements about "Current 
scholarship"? 
A. It underestimates the extent to which the American labor movement was aﬀected by the 
decline in inﬂuence of the Knights of Labor. 
B. It tends to downplay the intensity of the tension between skilled and unskilled workers who 
belonged to the Knights of Labor 
C. It oﬀers a more accurate view of the factors that led to the decline of the Knights of Labor than 
was oﬀered in earlier scholarship. 
D. It tends to characterize the organizational structure of the Knights of Labor in ways that 
obscure its eﬀect on the organization’s decline 
E. It fails to identify a key factor that accounts for the decline in membership of the Knights of 
Labor. 
2. According to the passage, the rapid decline in the Knights of Labor membership resulted in 
which of the following? 
A. Greater prominence of labor activists who advocated a relatively moderate approach to 
organizing workers 
B. Increasing tensions between labor activists who advocated a broad-based approach to 
organizing workers and those who advocated a less inclusive approach 
C. A decline in the number of workers who regarded labor organizing as an eﬀective means of 
advancing their interests 
D. An increase in the aggressiveness with which employer associations sought to undermine 
workers' eﬀorts to organize 
E. An increase in public concern over the use of extralegal means to undermine workers' eﬀorts to 
organize 
3. The author implies that the”organizations" highlighted in the passage were 
A. strengthened by their adoption of the Knights' organizational structure 
B. weakened by their separation of skilled from unskilled workers 
C. more intent than the Knights had been on achieving radical political reforms 
D. more aggressive than the Knights had been in countering the extralegal strategies used by 
employer associations 
E. less committed than the Knights had been to including all workers 


passage 305
While direct bite-inﬂicted injury is the most commonly observed mechanism for Komodo dragons 
to dispatch prey, the role of bacteria in aiding prey death is poorly known. One study identiﬁed in 
the lizards' saliva and oral cavities 58 species of bacteria 93 percent of which are classiﬁed as 
potentially pathogenic. Auﬀenberg proposed that the bacteria are beneﬁcial to the lizards in 
essence a slow-acting venom that facilitate prey capture by attacking lizards. He oﬀered no 
mechanism by which the bacteria are acquired by lizards, however. Fry et al. questioned this 
interpretation, and proposed that sepsis-inducing bacteria are more plausibly acquired passively 
from prey and other environmental sources, with no role in prey acquisition. That model ﬁts the 
observation that captive lizards (and presumably newborns) lack sepsis-inducing bacteria. 
1. It can be inferred from the passage that Auﬀenberg regarded the bacteria in Komodo dragon 
saliva as "beneﬁcial" because he believed that these bacteria 
A. play an important role in helping the lizards digest their food 
B. play an important role in maintaining the lizards' immune systems 
C. are a weapon used by the lizards to incapacitate their prey 
D. are transmitted directly from parent lizards to their oﬀspring 
E. deter larger predators from attacking the lizards 
2. Select a sentence in the passage that highlights a gap in an explanation. 


Passage 306
The hypothesis that paranormal phenomena are real but lie outside the limits of science is 
supported by considerable evidence. The Society for Psychical Research has collected stories of 
ordinary people apparently demonstrating paranormal abilities. Entirely anecdotal, this evidence 
has nothing to do with science, since it cannot be reproduced under controlled conditions. But 
the society took great trouble to interview ﬁrst-hand witnesses and to document the stories 
carefully. One fact that emerges clearly from the stories is that paranormal events occur, if they 
occur at all, only when people are experiencing strong emotion. This would immediately explain 
why paranormal phenomena are not observable under the conditions of a well-controlled 
scientiﬁc experiment. Strong emotion is inherently incompatible with controlled scientiﬁc 
procedures. 
1. Which of the following best describes the role played in the passage by the highlighted 
sentence? 
A. It states the main conclusion of the author's argument. 
B. It provides a basis for a recommended course of action. 
C. It articulates a principle that supports the claim made in the preceding sentence. 
D. It is intended to undermine the credibility of apparent evidence that the author has mentioned 
earlier in the passage. 
E. It serves to emphasize a limitation of the evidence collected by the Society for Psychical 
Research.
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
2. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would agree with which of the following 
descriptions of the evidence collected by the Society for Psychical Research? 
A. carefully recorded 
B. unscientiﬁc 
C. credible 


Passage 307
More than two decades after the death of George Balanchine, the choreographer's legacy is 
strangely unclear. In part this is because ballet has shallow roots in American culture. When 
Balanchine arrived in the United States in 1933, American ballet was little more than a vaudeville 
act. During the next 50 years, he raised American ballet to an internationally recognized art, 
producing an impressive body of great ballets and laying a foundation for generations to come—
or so it was thought at the time of his death. But dance has no written tradition and disappears 
easily from collective memory: unless Balanchine's dances are alive and interesting now, we are 
likely to forget why they ever seemed so important. 
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
1. It can be inferred that the author of the passage would probably agree with which of the 
following statements about ballet's lack of a written tradition? 
A. This lack is one reason that ballet has shallow roots in American culture. 
B. This lack makes it imperative that a ballet be performed regularly for it to remain alive. 
C. This lack makes it more diﬃcult to preserve a particular ballet in the public's consciousness.
2. The passage suggests that at the time of Balanchine's death, many people thought which of 
the following about Balanchine's work? 
A. There was little danger that Balanchine's work would be forgotten. 
B. It was unlikely that Balanchine's body of work would ever be equaled. 
C. Balanchine’s work had only shallow roots in American culture. 
D. Balanchine’s work was diﬃcult to understand due to the lack of a written balletic tradition. 
E. Balanchine’s work made work by other American choreographers look like a vaudeville act. 


Passage 308
This passage is adapted from material published in 2019 
In 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the "45Q legislation," which signiﬁcantly increases corporate 
tax credits for various uses of CO2 (carbon dioxide). The most controversial use is "enhanced oil 
recovery." An oil company purchases CO2, transports it by pipeline and injects it into depleted oil 
wells, pushing out extra oil it could not extract by conventional means. A climate change solution 
that entails producing more fossil fuels may sound Orwellian, and some environmental critics 
have attacked 45Q as just another fossil-fuel subsidy program in disguise. But enhanced oil 
recovery appears to reduce current emissions because the captured CO2 typically from natural 
gas or ethanol reﬁneries, gets sequestered underground. Some environmentalists, such as Kurt 
Waltzer of the Clean Air Task Force, argue that turning carbon capture into an energy technology. 
rather than an emissions technology, is the ﬁrst step toward broad commercial adoption of CO2, 
removal. It turns recaptured CO2, into a product to be bought or sold rather than simply a cost to 
be endured. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with 
A. discussing a controversial aspect of speciﬁc legislation relating to CO2 
B. explaining the science of a new process for capturing CO2 
C. highlighting the shortcomings of a speciﬁc method of combating climate change 
D. arguing that emissions technologies are the most eﬀective method of combating climate 
change 
E. summarizing the advantages of relying on legislation to combat climate change
2. According to the passage, "some environmental critics" object to the 45Q legislation on which 
of the following grounds? 
A. It will drive up the price of captured CO2. 
B. The process of extracting extra oil could have unforeseen environmental consequences. 
C. Fossil fuels extracted via enhanced oil recovery typically produce more carbon emissions than 
ethanol or natural gas. 
D. It will replace current subsidy programs that have been prover eﬀective. 
E. Its proponents' claims that it is part of a climate change solution are misleading. 
3. The passage suggests that Kurt Waltzer would likely agree with which of the following 
statements about the 45Q legislation 
A. It will likely replace some of the fossil-fuel subsidy programs that are currently in eﬀect 
B. It is likely to impede the development of economically eﬃcient ways of recapturing CO2 for 
sequestration. 
C. The positive eﬀects of other portions of the legislation will likely 
outweigh the environmental harm caused by its controversial aspects 
D. The incentives it provides for the production of more fossil fuel are an ineﬀective means of 
reducing the production of CO2 byproducts. 
E. Its provision of corporate tax credits for using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery may oﬀer a net 
gain in environmental terms 


Passage 309
Despite today's more eﬃcient electrical generators, modern electric-only power plants waste 
more of their fuel sources potential energy than did Thomas Edison's power plants of the late 
1800s. Edison used cast-oﬀ steam from his generators to warm nearby homes and factories. But 
few modern power plants use this residual heat, instead venting it into the air. When newer, larger 
plants required more real estate, they were built farther from customers. Moreover, because 
electricity travels easily, plants were located wherever they could tap the energy of a river or 
where local coal was especially cheap. The heat generated during the production of electricity 
does not travel far, however, so when power plants moved out to the horizon, the steam went to 
waste. 
1. It can be inferred from the passage that, in general, locating modern power plants closer to 
population centers would have 
A. compromised eﬀorts to conserve energy in populated areas 
B. decreased the demand for heating within those population centers 
C. resulted in higher costs for the fuel used by those plants 
D. required much larger plants than those currently operating 
E. obliged power companies to ﬁnd an alternative to coal as a fuel source 
2. The author suggests that steam generated by modern power plants is not used for heating 
because 
A. steam generally proves incompatible with most modem industrial needs 
B. other means of heating have become more cost-eﬀective 
C. steam is no longer produced in suﬃcient quantities to be useful 
D. insuﬃcient demand for heating exists nearby 
E. transporting steam long distances would prove to be prohibitively expensive 


Passage 310
Manatees are large marine mammals that inhabit the coastal waters of southern Florida and feed 
on the vegetation that grows in shallow waters. They frequently gather in the vicinity of power 
stations that release heated water into the sea. Since the warmer water supports abundant 
vegetation, some biologists have hypothesized that manatees gather in these areas because they 
are attracted to this convenient source of food. 
1. Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the hypothesis? 
A. When a power station near which manatees usually gather is shutdown for even a few hours, 
manatees move elsewhere. 
B. Other marine animals that feed on vegetation also congregate in large numbers in the vicinity of 
power stations 
C. All of the species of vegetation that grow near the power stations also grow elsewhere in the 
coastal waters of southern Florida, though not nearly as abundantly 
D. Even more manatees than usual gather near power stations during the winter months, when 
vegetation growth away from power stations slows 
E. Manatees also tend to gather in waters where high levels of nutrients support especially 
abundant vegetation 


Passage 311
During the past 1,000 years, the climates of the British Isles and continental Europe have 
undergone various episodes of change. It has long been believed that the demographic and 
economic expansion of Europe between the tenth and thirteenth centuries coincided with, and 
was perhaps encouraged by, a period of relative warmth, favorable to the expansion of cereal 
cultivation and the colonization of previously inhospitable environments. This benign phase, 
although variously dated, was seen to lie between a period of less favorable conditions in the late 
and post-Roman centuries and the so-called Little Ice Age of the early modem period, which was 
characterized by an overall cooling of the climate and, in particular by an increased severity of 
winters. Climatic deterioration was seen to have begun by circa 1300, presaged by an increase in 
stormy conditions in Europe, and associated with runs of wet and cool summers and the 
widespread harvest failures and livestock mortality of the years 1315-1322. 
The integrity of the so-called medieval warm period, once considered a global phenomenon, has, 
however, been called into question by recent paleoenvironmental research. The picture that now 
emerges is of a less coherent and perhaps more geographically restricted phase—variously dated
—of relative warmth, when temperatures in northwest Europe and the North Atlantic area were on 
average higher than in the post-Roman and early modern periods, although probably not warmer 
than in the late twentieth century. Some types of evidence, including the records of the advance 
and retreat of Alpine glaciers, suggest that the later fourteenth and early ﬁfteenth centuries may 
have seen a notable climatic downturn, followed by a temporary amelioration around1500, before 
renewed cooling into the Late Maunder Minimum period of 1675-1715. The relationship between 
glacial advance or retreat and temperature is, however, complex. A study of winter severity in 
central Europe during the fourteenth century found no clear trend, rather the alternation of runs of 
cold and mild winters.with the most sustained period of severe winters falling in the period 
301-1328. English documentary sources have been used to suggest a cooling trend from circa 
1240-1340, with a subsequent amelioration followed by renewed cooling from circa 1510, but the 
sporadic nature of this data series necessitates caution. A long-term cooling trend in the northern 
hemisphere between the twelfth/thirteenth and the seventeenth centuries does, however 
emerge from a plethora of sources, including tree-ring data, the study of lake and ocean 
sediments, and analysis of Greenland ice cores.

Passage 312
Editorial 
Opponents of a proposal to extend the city's subway line to two new stations claim that the 
project will beneﬁt only a small portion of the city's population. These opponents are 
misguided. After all, the last time the line was extended, the greater availability of quick transport 
to the city reduced the number of private cars or city streets, thus beneﬁting everyone by easing 
rush-hour traﬃc. 
1. In the argument in the editorial, the part that is highlighted plays which of the following roles? 
A. stating the conclusion toward which the argument is directed 
B. describing a circumstance that the argument seeks to explain 
C. introducing the position to be refuted by the argument 
D. serving as an intermediate conclusion that supports a further conclusion stated in the

E. introducing an explanation that is called into question by the argument 


Passage 313
While export prices remained robust, British India's Tea CessCommittee (TCC) made only 
sporadic, small-scale attempts to create demand for tea in India by giving away pre-brewed cups 
in selected locations and selling small packets of leaf fragments. Still, by 1930 only a fraction of 
the Indian population had tasted tea, and more than 90 percent of the crop was exported. The 
Great Depression decisively changed the picture, however. International tea prices plunged, and 
by 1935 growers faced an unsold surplus of more than a hundred million pounds. The prospect of 
a huge "uninitiated" market suddenly seemed appealing, and the TCC, reorganized as the Indian 
Tea Market Expansion Board (ITMEB) and provided with an expanded budget, began the largest 
marketing campaign in Indian history. 
1. The passage suggests that "small packets of leaf fragments" were 
A. preferred by Indian consumers over other forms of tea 
B. too valuable to be sold in large packets to consumers 
C. marketed in response to a local surplus of unsold tea leaves 
D. likely to sell for high prices if exported 
E. an ineﬀective way to expand the local tea market

Market Expansion Board in order to 
A. appeal to Indian consumers' sense of national identity 
B. escape the TCC's reputation for selling low-quality tea 
C. increase the prestige of tea by emphasizing its exotic origins 
D. receive a larger budget for marketing tea in India 
E. respond to economic conditions created by the Great Depression 


Passage 314
Since the 1970s, there has been a movement in African literary studies toward the recognition of 
national literatures in newly independent African states, such as Cameroon, Senegal, and Benin. 
But while in some of these national literatures there has undoubtedly emerged a sense of 
corporate identity, often marked by clear thematic and formal progressions, it remains an 
incontrovertible fact that the European languages in which these literatures are expressed have 
only an oﬃcial acceptance: they are neither indigenous to the cultures on which they have 
been imposed, nor are they national in any real sense of the word. This must limit the claims 
of any of these literatures to national signiﬁcance, however abundant the corpus or coherent the 
internal conﬁgurations. 
1. According to the passage, certain African literatures have 
A. undergone signiﬁcant changes since the 1970s 
B. ﬂourished as a result of governmental support 
C. been directed primarily at non-African audiences 
D. avoided openly discussing sensitive cultural issues 
E. achieved a degree of internal cohesiveness 
2. The highlighted portion of the passage serves primarily to 
A. support a conclusion stated later in the passage 
B. qualify an assertion presented earlier in the passage 
C. suggest an explanation for an anomaly mentioned in the passage  
D. oﬀer a tentative answer to a question raised in the passage 
E. justify the use of a term introduced earlier in the passage 


Passage 315
Unlike most plants, cactuses absorb carbon dioxide from the air mainly at night. Night air contains 
greater quantities of certain types of carbon than does daytime air. Consequently, these types of 
carbon are more common in cactuses than in most other plants. Quintral plants, however, which 
grow as parasites on cactuses, contain nearly the same proportions of these types of carbon as 
cactuses. Therefore, quintral plants probably take signiﬁcant quantities of carbon from their 
cactus hosts, since ______. 
1. Which of the following most logically completes the argument? 
A. in the desert climates where cactuses grow, carbon dioxide is signiﬁcantly more abundant in 
the air during the day than at night 
B. cactuses that have quintral plants growing as parasites on them do not absorb as much 
carbon dioxide from the air as do cactuses of comparable size that are free of parasites  
C. quintral plants are the only kind of parasites that grow on such kinds of cactuses 
D. in areas where quintral plants are common, individual cactuses often have several such plants 
growing on them 
E. nearly all of the carbon dioxide absorbed from the air by quintral plants is absorbed during the 
day 


Passage 316
Historical demographers have generally agreed on two interrelated features of the urban 
populations in early-modern Germany. First in accordance with the law of natural decrease, 
extremely high mortality rates in cities (urban areas with more than10.000 inhabitants) meant that 
their populations could not be sustained by reproduction alone. Population density, inadequate 
sanitary conditions, and poor housing made cities too vulnerable to disease and death. Second, 
when city populations did increase, it was as a result of in-migration suﬃcient to overcome the 
population losses caused by the high mortality. But because the parish registers of urban 
communities with fewer than 10.000 inhabitants show that the annual number of births usually 
equaled or exceeded that of deaths, historical demographers assume that the law of natural 
decrease did not apply to small towns. 
1. The author suggests that according to historical demographers, the birth rate in early-modem 
German cities 
A. was aﬀected by sanitary conditions 
B. increased as a result of in-migration 
C. was lower than the annual death rate 
D. decreased as population density increased 
E. was lower than the rate in communities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants 
2. Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. 
It can be inferred that historical demographers generally believe which of the following about 
communities of fewer than 10,000 people in early-modern Germany? 
A. mortality rates were lower than those in cities of over 10,000 inhabitants. 
B. in-migrations were not a signiﬁcant factor in population trends. 
C. population levels remained quite stable for extended periods. 


Passage 317
Most of the studies of the eﬀect of aging on short-term memory have led researchers to conclude 
that younger adults perform short-term-memory tasks better than people over the age of 65. But 
these studies were all conducted in afternoon sessions. In a recent study conducted both in 
morning and in afternoon sessions, the older participants performed much better in morning 
sessions than in afternoon sessions. The younger participants did not, however, perform any 
better in the morning. 
1. The statements given are structured to lead to which of the following conclusions? 
A. Most previous studies led researchers to underestimate the ability of older adults to perform 
short-term-memory tasks 
B. In the morning, people over 65 perform short-term-memory tasks better than younger adults 
do 
C. There is no signiﬁcant overall diﬀerence in long-term memory between older adults and 
younger adults. 
D. The results of most previous studies of the eﬀect of aging on short-term memory are best 
interpreted as showing that age has no eﬀect on the ability to perform short-term-memory tasks 
E. Younger adults are able to perform short-term-memory tasks better if they perform them in the 
afternoon than if they perform them in the morning. 


Passage 318
Early scholars described square dances as a type of ancient English country dance carried to the 
southern Appalachian Mountains and preserved unchanged for generations. However, while the 
Appalachian ﬁddle repertoire does include traditional reels that can be traced back to the British 
Isles, it also includes breakdowns, rags, and other musical features native to America. 
Appalachian songs similarly range from British ballads to African American blues. Given this 
musical diversity-not to mention the iconic presence of the banjo, an instrument with African 
roots-it would be naive to think the accompanying dances are purely English forms. While 
sections of Appalachia are relatively isolated trade, travel, and immigration have continually 
introduced new cultural elements, including innovations in social dances, into the 
region's rural traditions. 
1. The passage suggests that which of the following was true of "early 
scholars? 
A. They downplayed the African inﬂuence on traditional English dance forms. 
B. They overlooked the importance of migration in Appalachian history. 
C. They may have been unaware of the complexity of Appalachia’s musical traditions 
D. They underestimated the prominence of the ﬁddle in Appalachian dance music. 
E. They neglected the social context in which Appalachian square dances were performed
2. According to the passage, Appalachian square dancing diﬀers from English country dancing in 
that Appalachian square dancing 
A. is closely associated with the banjo 
B. is particularly common in rural settings 
C. can be performed to the tune of a reel 
D. developed in isolation from outside inﬂuences 
E. has changed signiﬁcantly since it ﬁrst emerged 


Passage 319
Though great gains in membership, particularly among women, as well as success in gaining 
concessions from employers over working conditions and wages, characterized many United 
States labor unions during the First World War, by the postwar years of 1919 1921, many of these 
gains had begun to be undermined. Especially signiﬁcant, then, is the story of consolidation and 
increase in power after the war by Local 36 of the International Laundry Workers' Union, whose 
members were primarily Black women.  
On May 29, 1918 Local 36 struck all seven laundries in Little Rock, Arkansas. The case was 
referred to the National War Labor Board (NWLB), which ruled in favor ofLocal 36 Most of the 
laundry owners attempted to undermine the terms of the ruling by delaying or complicating its 
implementation. New hearings were held in May 1919, and again the NWLB decided in favor of 
the union By then, however, the NWLB- which had never held the power of enforcement—had lost 
even the persuasive advantage it had been able to employ during the war, and it regretfully 
informed the workers that they were on their own The laundry workers chose to continue the ﬁght 
Local 36 declared a strike at the Fame Laundry, the worst oﬀender among the city's laundries, 
and sued its owner to prevent him from using the treasured union label; the union's action 
inspired a citywide boycott. On June 27, Local 36 announced that it intended to open a 
cooperative laundry. The cooperative ﬂourished, and the Fame Laundry went out of business.  
Local 36's achievements during the war were facilitated by several factors. Because their work 
was essential to the military installations surrounding the city, the laundry workers' cause received 
immediate publicity and was quickly referred to the NWLB. Because several issues raised by 
Local 36's situation ﬁt unusually well with the NWLB's concerns (for example, the recognition of 
workers' right to a wage on which they could live, and the principle of equal pay for equal work, 
regardless of race or gender), the workers received a great deal of institutional support, as well as 
the favorable ruling. 
But it was the solidarity maintained by the laundry workers, both Black and White, that was 
responsible for their union's continuing success. Whereas after the war many United States labor 
organizations lost the feeling of community generated during the period of national crisis, Local 36 
remained a singularly eﬀective experiment in interracial cooperation. These women sustained their 
initiative and commitment through a four-year period, during which they mobilized an impressive 
community network. They demonstrated their determination by repeatedly threatening to strike. 
Finally, by going into business for themselves, this group of historically disempowered workers 
displayed the ﬂexibility and creativity necessary to provide themselves with steady, well-
compensated employment and improved working conditions. 
1. The passage is primarily concerned with discussing 
A. the employment situation of Black women in early twentieth-century Arkansas 
B. the challenges encountered by unions in the years directly after the First World War 
C. the reasons for a particular success in the early twentieth-century labor movement 
D. reforms introduced in the laundry business in the early twentieth century as a result of union 
initiatives  
E. federal support for unions during the First World War and the reasons for its decline after the 
war 
2. It can be inferred from the passage that which of the following was one of Local 36’s 
grievances against the Little Rock laundry owners? 
A. Conditions for workers in the laundries were highly unsafe. 
B. The laundry workers were not granted any vacation or sick leave. 
C. The wages earned by laundry workers were inadequate to support the workers and their 
families. 
D. The laundry owners attempted to hire many more men than women. 
E. Workers in the laundries were often ﬁred for complaining about their working conditions. 


3. According to the passage, which of the following statements about the National War Labor 
Board is true? 
A. It successfully changed conditions in Little Rock laundries by exercising persuasive measures. 
B. It forced the laundry owners to obey all of its rulings only after persuasion had failed 
C. It was unwilling to attempt to inﬂuence the actions of the laundry owners. 
D. It successfully obliged Local 36 to abide by all of its rulings. 
E. It was unable to compel the laundry owners to comply with the 
terms of its rulings. 
4. The passage suggests that which of the following contributed to the erosion after the First 
World War of the progress previously realized by the labor movement in the United States? 
A. Many United States labor unions, encouraged by their success, alienated the public with 
excessive demands after the war. 
B. United States labor leaders became absorbed in political issues and neglected their unions’ 
practical goals after the war. 
C. United States business leaders undermined the inﬂuence of labor organizers by granting 
workers minimal concessions. 
D.  Many United States labor organizations failed to maintain the internal cohesion they had 
developed during the war. 
E. The workers’ bargaining power was lessened by the sudden availability of nonunion labor after 
the war. 


Passage 320 
Calculating hydroelectric plants' environmental impact is not simple. Dam building requires steel 
and cement, the manufacture of which entails greenhouse gas emissions. Estimates for these 
emissions are relatively straightforward to make and show that the consequences are small 
compared to the beneﬁts of generating greenhouse gas-free hydroelectric power. But more 
diﬃcult-to-estimate greenhouse gas contributions occur during the plants operation. The 
submerging of large areas behind dams results in the microbial decomposition of vegetation, 
which produces substantial quantities of methane—a potent greenhouse gas. Furthermore, 
eradicating vegetation eliminates the consumption of the greenhouse gas CO2 by that vegetation. 
Estimating amounts of these gases is diﬃcult, and amounts vary depending upon the 
speciﬁc location, terrain, and power intensity of the dam with its associated lake. 
1. The author would most likely agree with which of the following assertions about the 
environmental impact of hydroelectric power plants? 
A. It cannot be inferred from calculations of the environmental impact of a few hydroelectric 
plants. 
B. It is not primarily determined by the eﬀects of dam building on vegetation. 
C. It cannot be calculated with suﬃcient accuracy to justify the requirement of environmental 
impact studies prior to plant construction. 
D. It could be signiﬁcantly improved if the amounts of steel and cement used for dam building 
could be decreased. 
E. It is too substantial, when all factors are considered, to justify the building of new dams. 
2. The highlighted sentence serves primarily to 
A. support a claim made at the beginning of the passage 
B. acknowledge a problem inherent in a particular kind of calculation 
C. anticipate and respond to a possible criticism of the author’s overall argument 
D. introduce a problem that will be explored later in the passage 
E. point out an exception to a general claim

African American musicians in the 1950s faced a dilemma regarding classical music. A 
cosmopolitan display of knowledge about modern classical music enabled artists such as 
Duke Ellington to counter misconceptions that jazz musicians were untutored. Yet jazz 
musicians' interest in classical music was often taken as an admission that jazz 
innovations were derived from European sources. After Charlie Parker expressed 
admiration for Bartok, an interviewer asked if Parker's musical innovations were 
adaptations of classical predecessors ideas. Often, comparisons with modem European 
composers connected jazz to the presumed superior standards of classical music without 
recognizing that jazz articulated its own musical vision—by developing expressive and 
improvisational principles rooted in a wide variety of African American musics—that 
challenged the hegemony of European standard in American music.【微信公众号：张巍

Passage 322
The following passage comes from a study of the relationship between habitat and 
disease.
In a set of small, northern, temperate lakes, large epidemics of a common, virulent 
fungus in host populations of the zooplankton Daphnia dentifera are more common in 
steep-sided U-shaped lakes than in gently sloped V-shaped lakes. According to one 
hypothesis, this is due to differences in host susceptibility. However, in a study of twelve 
lakes we found no relationship between basin shape and host susceptibility in an in situ 
microcosm experiment in which hosts from each lake were incubated with spores. Thus, 
hosts were not dramatically less susceptible to this virulent fungal parasite in V-shaped 
lakes where epidemics are uncommon. This result echoes those from more controlled lab 
experiments with genetically similar organisms from fewer Jakes. We continued to ﬁnd no 
relationship between host susceptibility and basin shape even when we controlled for 
slight variation of temperature between lakes (since temperature elevates transmission) 
and mean bod size of adults among lakes (since size also elevates transmission). If 
anything, hosts collected in summer 2005 from lakes that had epidemics in the previous 
year were marginally less susceptible to infection than hosts collected from lakes without 
epidemics in 2004, a result consistent with previously observed rapid evolution of hosts in 
response to epidemics.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】

Passage 323
The Wall Street millionaire Alfred Loomis was an amateur physicist who made signiﬁcant 
contributions to scientiﬁc research. In 1928 he purchased three identical clocks, the most 
accurate available at that time. Loomis set up the clocks in a triangular orientation to one 
another, to break the gravitationally induced synchronic action among their pendulums, 
and by analyzing their minute variations, veriﬁed a theoretically predicted tidal effect of 
the Moon on clocks. These results later contributed to the development of LORAN (Long-
Ranges Navigation), which triangulates the positions of ships and aircraft by comparing 
the difference in arrival times of signals coming from multiple radio beacons at various 
groundbased locations, a calculation that depends on accurate timekeeping.【微信公众

Passage 325
While Gayl Jones's ﬁction has received signiﬁcant critical, attention, her comparably 
quiet, yet formidable, corpus of poetry has been virtually ignored by scholars. 
Signiﬁcantly, Jones's ﬁrst publication appeared in verse, and her literary production from 
1969 through the early 1980s includes nearly as many poems as short stories, betraying 
a formative and consistent involvement with poetry. Jones's lack of critical recognition as 
a poet is at least partially traceable to her documented ambivalence regarding genre 
boundaries and artistic identity: "I've never really considered myself a poet. I've written 
what I call poetry but I've always thought of myself as primarily a ﬁction writer and so I 
write poetry from the viewpoint and interest of a storyteller." Consistent with this self-
conceptualization, Jones's critical observations regarding the work of other poets often 
focus on techniques traditionally associated with ﬁction writing: narrative and its 
rendering usually appear to outweigh the various poetic conventions of prosody and 
form. While reviewing the work of Sterling Brown, Jones provides a checklist of what 
chieﬂy attracts her in poetry: characterization and narrative voice are foregrounded, 
accompanied by such structural concerns of ﬁction as dramatic forms and scenes, all of 
which combine to reveal a sensibility interested primarily in formulating a poetics of 
effective storytelling.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
1. According to the passage, the "checklist" provides a record of which of the following?
A. The features of Sterling Brown's poetry that Jones ﬁnds unique 
B. The techniques that Jones believes distinguish poetry from ﬁction 
C. Jones's effort to distinguish herself from other poets 
D. Ways in which Jones inﬂuenced Sterling Brown 
E. The qualities in poetry that most interest Jones
2. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage regarding the nature of 
Jones's poetry?
A. It reﬂects her self-identiﬁcation as a teller of stories.
B. It is more assertive than her poetry criticism.
C. It is acclaimed more as storytelling than as actual poetry.
D. It uses dramatic forms and scenes in unprecedented ways.
E. Its concern with narrative voice is greater than that of most ﬁction of the period.
3. The passage suggests which of the following regarding critics of Jones's work？
A. Their lack of interest in Jones's poetry has been prompted by their unawareness of the 
extent of her poetic production.
B. They have tended to judge Jones's work in different genres according to the deﬁnitions 
of those genres accepted by Jones's contemporaries.
C. The nature of their focus on Jones has been inﬂuenced by Jones's own 
characterizations of her work.
D. They have discounted Jones's observations regarding the work of other poets as 
narrow-minded.
E. They have foregrounded Jones's explorations of prosody and form at the expense of

evidence as do physicists or biochemists. Modern science tries to carry out these 
operations in a more careful and systematic way by using controls and statistical 
tests, insisting on replication, and so forth. Moreover, scientiﬁc measurements are

Passage 329
The distinction between the nutritional quality and quantity of prey is one component of 
the hypotheses that attempt to explain the declining populations of Steller sea lions in the 
Gulf of Alaska beginning in the 1970s. One view holds that the quantity of prey available 
was high overall, but because of the species composition of available prey (primarily non-
fatty ﬁsh of the gadid family), the diet was nutritionally inferior-the junk food hypothesis. 
An alternative view is that gadids are nutritionally adequate but were not available 
in sufﬁcient numbers because of ﬁshing or some other factor. In either case, 
juvenile sea lions would be affected more than mature individuals because of the 
younger animals’ higher energy requirements and relative inexperience at foraging.【微

Passage 330
Recent archaeological excavations of the massive warehouses of Huánuco  Pampa—an 
important city in the Incan empire of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries—initially led 
archaeologists to believe that the city was a center for the distribution of food and goods 
to settlements in the surrounding region. However, excavations in those settlements have 
yielded few traces of the pottery containers used to store goods in Huánuco Pampa’s 
warehouses. This absence of pottery traces is inconclusive since goods may have been 
distributed in containers other than those belonging to the warehouses.
One sixteenth-century Spanish document may inadvertently reveal the answer: while 
detailing countless instances of goods being brought to the warehouses from the 
surrounding region, the document says nothing about goods being distributed throughout 
the surrounding region from the warehouses. Thus initial suggestions about the city s role 
as a distribution center may be incorrect: Huánuco Pampa’s reason for maintaining these 
huge warehouses may have been simply to ensure its own well-being during periods of 
hardship.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
1. The passage is primarily concerned with 
A. comparing the merits of different kinds of historical evidence
B. tracing the origins of a widely held belief about a body of historical evidence 
C. citing evidence that suggests a new interpretation of archaeological remains 
D. evaluating the usefulness of particular historical sources 
E. correcting a misperception by reexamining historical data
2. The author suggests which of the following about the sixteenth-century Spanish 
document discussed in the passage?
A. Although the document was initially used by archaeologists to support a particular 
theory about Huánuco Pampa’s warehouses, it was subsequently interpreted as 
contradictory of that theory.
B. Although the document intends to record the ﬂow of food and goods between 
Huánuco Pampa and the surrounding region, it provides a wealth of information about 
Huánuco Pampa’s political life.
C. Although it discusses warehouses in very general terms, the document reveals much 
information about how Huánuco Pampa allocated its warehoused supplies throughout 
the region.
D. Although the document does not discuss whether Huánuco Pampa distributed food 
and goods throughout the surrounding region, the fact that it does not implies that the city 
did not perform this function.
E. Although the document was known to archaeologists prior to the excavation of 
Huánuco Pampa, that excavation revealed the document to be more accurate about 
Huánuco Pampa’s daily life than was previously thought.
3. Which of the following, if true, would cast the most doubt on the author’s reasoning 
about the probable purpose of the Huánuco Pampa warehouses?
A. Further examination reveals that the sixteenth-century Spanish document cited by the 
author was intended solely to record the amount of food and goods farmers and artisans 
in the surrounding region contributed to Huánuco Pampa’s warehouses each year.
B. Several large warehouses similar to those of Huánuco Pampa are unearthed in 
subsequent archaeological excavations in the region surrounding Huánuco Pampa.
C. A contemporaneous document is discovered establishing that Huánuco Pampa’s 
political inﬂuence in the surrounding region was far greater than archaeologists and 
historians had previously supposed.
D. Traces of pottery storage containers similar in style to those of the Huánuco Pampa 
warehouses are discovered in a section of the Incan empire remote from Huánuco 
Pampa.
E. Archaeologists discover that Huánuco Pampa was able to maintain constant stores of 
goods in its warehouses despite ﬂuctuations in agricultural conditions in the surrounding 
region.

Passage 331
Simulations indicate, and observations conﬁrm, that the particles constituting Saturn’s 
rings are giving up angular momentum to moons of the planet. The simulations predict 
that over just a few hundred million years, the related energy transfer will cause the rings’ 
collapse. An analogous process occurs around young stars in the disks of matter from 
which planets emerge, and these protoplanetary disks do vanish that quickly, computer 
models show. Yet if Saturn’s rings are so short-lived, a large comet or moon—the rings’ 
presumed source—must have broken apart in Saturn’s vicinity within the past several 
hundred million years. That is quite unlikely. It would have been much more probable in 
the young solar system—4 billion years ago or more.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】

C. the accepted understanding of them is challenged by observations of Saturn’s rings 
D. the material of which Saturn’s rings are composed must at one time have been in a

Passage 332
The seemingly unrelated aims of functional strength and aesthetic appeal had been not 
only successfully integrated in many of the classic suspension bridges of the past two 
centuries but also commonly achieved by engineers alone or leading teams. Thomas 
Telford was in fact both engineer and architect of his Menai Suspension Bridge, and John 
Roebling was both engineer and architect of his Brooklyn Bridge. That these engineering 
structures especially have come to be regarded as architectural icons demonstrates the 
aesthetic heights that an engineer can achieve.
Engineers less artistically conﬁdent than Telford and Roebling have engaged consulting 
architects to advise them on the design of everything from the facades placed on 
massive anchorages and skyscraper-high towers to the ﬁnishing details like deck railings 
and lampposts. Othmar Ammann, the chief engineer of the George Washington and 
many other New York City bridges, often sought the help of famous architects. When the 
George Washington was but an idea on paper, Ammann engaged Cass Gilbert, the 
architect of the Woolworth Building and other landmarks, to depict how the towers might 
be ﬁnished in stone. Since money was tight when the bridge was being completed, 
however, the steel-framed towers were left bare-a look that the Swiss architect Le 
Corbusier found extremely appealing-and bare steel became the new aesthetic standard 
for monumental bridge towers.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】

2. The passage implies that Othmar Ammann was
A. responsible for a design that became an aesthetic touchstone for later bridges
B. ﬁnancially constrained from hiring the architects he wished for the George Washington 
Bridge
C. less certain of his aesthetic design abilities than Telford and Roebling were of theirs
3. According to the passage, which of the following is true of Cass Gilbert’s ideas for 
ﬁnishing the towers of the George Washington Bridge?
A. They had to be abandoned during construction.
B. They impressed Le Corbusier.
C. They were judged to be too costly when the project was initially proposed.
D. They derived from themes Gilbert had explored in the Woolworth Building.

B. Because of the types of accidents that can happen in and around swimming pools, the 
largest part of the operating expenses for the community pool will be lifeguards’ salaries 
and liability insurance.
C. The operation of a pool would bring increased trafﬁc to the road leading to the site of 
the proposed pool and would require the town to fund costly road improvements.
D. The same survey that established that a majority of Oakville’s residents would use a 
community pool also found that over one-third of the town’s residents would have 
preferred that it be built at a different site.

Passage 334
Isobel Grundy rightly argues that in researching pre-nineteenth-century women’s 
historical writing, scholars must deﬁne history broadly and include historical ﬁction, 
biography, court memoirs, and family history. Grundy also believes that these writings 
provide "a history of a whole female culture, while embodying a pre-nineteenth-century 
feminine" relationship to history. On this point, am skeptical, as I do not believe there was 
a characteristic women’s relationship to history. Instead, my research suggests that pre-
nineteenth-century British women writers’ engagement with historical discourse 
depended on such things as their political commitments and class afﬁliations and their 
perceptions of developing historical genres and markets. We must give sufﬁcient 
attention to the myriad individual authors and texts before generalizing widely about 
women writers’ engagements with history.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
1. The passage implies that its author would agree with which of the following statements 
about "historical ﬁction, biography, court memoirs, and family history"?
A. These genres had their origins primarily among pre-nineteenth-century British women 
writers.
B. These genres were probably more reﬂective of women’s views in pre-nineteenth-
century Britain than they were in later periods.
C. These genres can help scholars develop a comprehensive view of British women’s 
historical writing.
D. These genres have generally been regarded by scholars as more reliable sources of 
information about pre-nineteenth-century women than have other genres of historical 
writing.
E. These genres are remarkably homogeneous in the way they represent the lives of pre-
nineteenth-century women in Britain.
2. Which of the following describes a difference between the author and Grundy 
regarding British women writers’ engagement with historical discourse?
A. The author thinks the engagement was determined primarily in response to developing 
literary markets; Grundy thinks it had little to do with such markets.
B. The author believes the engagement is reﬂected in numerous genres; Grundy thinks 
that one genre is speciﬁcally feminine.
C. The author emphasizes the heterogeneity of factors that inﬂuenced the engagement 
Grundy suggests that the engagement was uniﬁed by one particular factor.
D. The author thinks the engagement was limited to women in certain social classes; 
Grundy thinks it was common to all classes.
E. The author believes the engagement was just beginning in the late 1700s; Grundy 
thinks it reached its peak then.

Much of ecological theory consists of models that are so highly idealized that they are of 
little real-world predictive value. In addition, many of the parameters used in models—
such as birth and death rates—are exceedingly difﬁcult to estimate accurately in the ﬁeld. 
Consequently, ecological theory is rarely directly relevant to the practice of 
conservation biology. One notable exception is MacArthur’s theory of island 
biogeography, which predicts the species richness of an island on the basis of its size 
and degree of isolation. This theory could provide important insights into nature 
preserves, which can be analogous to islands, often consisting of relatively undisturbed 
ecosystems surrounded by biologically distinct areas.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】

Passage 336
The gender and class associations of handicrafts altered by the middle of the nineteenth 
century. During the eighteenth century, crafts such as embroidery, drizzling [unraveling 
and rewinding of metallic threads from brocades], and collage had been prized for their 
aristocratic associations and practiced by men as well as women. But in the early 
nineteenth century, handicraft became coded as a woman’s hobby speciﬁcally, and it was 
increasingly identiﬁed with a middle-class sensibility, as a thrifty, skillful mode of domestic 
management. This does not mean handicraft was limited to the middle class, on the 
contrary, needlework continued to be popular with upper-class women, while domestic 
ornamentation was prized even by the very poor. But it means that handicraft now 
signiﬁed the moral, managerial virtues of the bourgeoisie, not just aristocratic leisure, and 
that members of other classes were emulating these middle-class ideals when they did 
craftwork. In the nineteenth century, when high-art venues were largely closed off to 
women, they channeled their creative urges into the world around them, using the 
elements most readily available. This kind of domestic decoration was also sanctioned 
because it added to the comforts of the home, whereas more ambitious high art was 
condemned as a selﬁsh use of time taken away from the family.
Indeed, by the mid-nineteenth century, the handicraft’s most visible and urgent function 
was to signify womanhood. Craft items were made by the home’s female inhabitant and 
thus appeared to be an extension of her body, as well as carrying the signs of her taste 
and skill. The woman’s hands had held it, her mind had planned it, her eyes had gauged 
it, and she had communicated something of her intangible subjectivity to the completed 
object. For the Victorians, then, women were ensconced in a cocoon of items of their own 
manufacture, representing otherwise invisible aspects of their identity. This is the image 
behind Ruskin’s famous claim that “wherever a true wife comes, this home is always 
around her.” The craft was frequently described as “pretty” or “elegant,” qualities that 
elided the object with its maker’s own body. The craft was the woman’s home skills made 
concrete, a tangible trace of her household labor that was all the more valuable for 
having been produced in leisure hours, for it showed that labor was leisure, that she 
never stopped working to improve the domestic abode.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】

Passage 337
The theory of motivated reasoning suggests that, in legal decisions, different judges will 
assess the same information differently, depending on their backgrounds and 
fundamental values. Attitudinalists (theorists who contend that judges’ decisions are 
driven by their own policy preferences) have concurred that their ﬁndings on ideological 
decision making could be explained by the “human reﬂex” to “convince oneself of the 
propriety of what one prefers to believe—motivated reasoning.”
Motivated reasoning, however, is subject to “reasonableness constraints.” For example, 
the accuracy of decision making is enhanced when the stakes for the decision are higher, 
when the decision must be justiﬁed, and when the decision will be made public. Such 
circumstances often apply to judicial decisions. The presence of stronger arguments 
contrary to preferences reduces the inﬂuence of motivations. The limitations of the power 
of motivated reasoning are apparent from the numerous unanimous opinions of the 
United States Supreme Court (whose members generally represent a range of 
ideological predispositions) and other cases in which justices appear to vote contrary to 
their ideological preferences. One would anticipate that the inﬂuence of such motivated 
reasoning is at its apex when the law is relatively less determinate, which is consistent 
with the ﬁndings of empirical research.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
1. The author suggests which of the following about motivated reasoning?
A. It allows judges to take into consideration on a wide range of views beyond those that 
they themselves hold.
B. It has a greater impact on the decision of judges with certain kinds of policy 
preferences than on the decisions of judges with other preferences.
C. It is unlikely to result in ideologically biased judicial decisions in cases where the law is 
open to multiple interpretations
D. Its effects on a decision may be mitigated by exposure to compelling arguments that 
challenge the decision maker’s biases.
E. Its impact on judicial decision making may be more evident in decisions rendered by 
the United States Supreme Court than in decisions rendered by other courts.
2. It can be inferred that the author the uses the United States Supreme Court to illustrate 
the argument because of a belief that the
A. Supreme Court is obligated to render its decisions without regard to its members’ 
ideological predispositions
B. record of the Supreme Court shows it to be roughly similar to other courts in the 
frequency with which its decision particular policy preference
C. extent to which decisions made by the Supreme Court are affected by reasonableness 
constraints is relatively easy to determine
D. unanimous decisions sometimes handed down by the Supreme Court would be 
unlikely to come from an ideologically diverse court if motivated reasoning were 
unchecked
E. members of the Supreme Court provide clear and extended explanations of the 
reasoning that has informed their decisions

A. They allow decision makers to rationalize lapses in their objectivity.

Astronomers can measure any given star’s radial velocity by examining its spectrum—
light spread out into its constituent wavelengths. If an object is moving toward us, its 
spectral lines shift to sorter wavelengths; if it's moving away, the lines swing to longer 
wavelengths. The higher the velocity, the greater the shift. Although this sort of spectral 
analysis is straightforward for nearby stars, it becomes far more difﬁcult for distant stars 
in the Milky Way’s outer halo. Even age telescopes can't gather enough of their light. For 
this reason, astronomer Ulrich Heber conjectures that there are probably several low-
mass hypervelocity stars yet to be discovered. Although these diminutive objects live

Passage 340
Many scholarly discussions of novelist Willa Cather (1873-1947) debate whether Cather 
belongs more to the nineteenth-century realist tradition or to the modernist revolution of 
the early twentieth century. While Cather’s preoccupation with nineteenth-century 
agrarian culture has won her the respect of readers and critics, her distrust of modernity 
left her with a historically unstable position in the modernist canon. Resistance to the 
changes wrought by the twentieth century, of course, does not necessarily disqualify one 
from the“modernist” label. The impulse to reconnect with more primitive, earlier times is a 
hallmark of modernist aesthetics, shaping the search for meaning in a fragmented, 
disenchanted, mechanized world. Yet more often than not, [literary critic] Phyllis Rose 
explains, the early tenth-century atmosphere of experimentation and “making it new” and 
an attendant critical discourse that “valued complexity, ambiguity, even obscurity” 
resulted in Cather's labeling as “naively traditional” and “essentially nostalgic and 
elegiac.” In effect in modernist studies she has been treated as a romantic regional writer, 
unconcerned with the international terrain so integral to modem thinking-at least until 
scholars, in the 1980s and 1990s, began reevaluating the historical record, 
demonstrating her innovative departures from nineteenth-century ﬁction, including 
antiheroism, gender-bending episodic narrative, antirealism, simple prose, emphasis on 
memory and time, and the exploration of immigration, empire, and race. Today it is not 
uncommon to encounter critics announcing Cather’s newfound canonical status as a 
modernist-indicated most clearly by her inclusion in works such as The Cambridge 
Companion to American Modernism published in 2005.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
1. The author would be most likely to agree with which of the following claims about 
Cather's “preoccupation with nineteenth-century agrarian culture?
A. It is regarded by some as evidence of an attitude toward the modern world that is 
characteristic of many modernist writers.
B. Its deﬁnitive role in Cather's writing distinguishes Cather from most authors who were 
considered to be central to the modernist literary tradition.
C. It was clearly an important element of Cather's early ﬁction but played little role in her 
later, more mature novels.
D. It has frequently been misinterpreted by the very readers and critics who are most 
strongly drawn to Cather's ﬁction
E. Divergent interpretations of it have led critics to form diametrically opposed 
conclusions about the overall quality of Cather's literary output
2. The author mentions the “critical discourse” primarily to
A. explain why some critics rejected the idea that any particular literary style was 
uniquely modernist
B. challenge an assumption about the extent to which Cather's novels express a 
nostalgic view of the past
C. suggest that most of Cather's readers have little in common with the scholarly 
commentators who have written about her work
D. demonstrate that literary critics’ views about Cather's ﬁction diverge widely on certain 
points
E. introduce an explanation of criteria used to determine whether Cather belonged in a 
particular literary category
3. The reference to the highlighted work serves primarily to
A. suggest that no major advances in Cather scholarship have been made since 2005

Because densely populated urban centers concentrate human activity, we think of them 
as pollution crisis zones. Ecology-minded discussions often focus on ways to make cities 
seem somewhat less oppressively man-made, such as increasing the area devoted to 40 
parks or easing the intensity of development. But most such changes would actually 
undermine cities’ extraordinary energy efﬁciency. Per unit of area, cities in the United 
States generate more greenhouse gases, use more energy, and produce more solid 
waste than most other American regions of comparable size. On a map depicting 
negative environmental impacts in relation to surface area, therefore, cities would look 
like intense hot spots. If you plotted the same negative impacts by resident or household,

Passage 343
The infectious disease known as whooping cough is commonly thought to be a childhood 
illness, but a recent study suggests that more adults contract this illness than was 
previously suspected. Although the disease is life-threatening in children, in adults it 
typically causes only a persistent cough which, though annoying, is rarely serious. 
Therefore, the incidence of whooping cough in adults poses no signiﬁcant public health 
threat.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A. Whooping cough is more difﬁcult to diagnose in adults than in children.
B. Adults with whooping cough do not readily transmit the disease to children.
C. Most adults who contract whooping cough get the disease from children with whom 
they are in close contact.
D. A disease poses no signiﬁcant public health threat unless it is life-threatening.
E. Under comparable conditions of exposure, adults contract whooping cough more 
readily than do children.

Passage 344
Sensationalism—the purveyance of emotionally charged content, focused mainly on 
violent crime, to a broad public—has often been decried, but the full history of the 
phenomenon has yet to be written. Scholars have tended to dismiss sensationalism as 
unworthy of serious study, based on two pervasive though somewhat incompatible 
assumptions: ﬁrst, that sensationalism is essentially a commercial product, built on the 
exploitation of modern mass media, and second, that it appeals almost entirely to a 
simple, basic emotion and thus has little history apart from the changing technological 
means of spreading it. An exploration of sensationalism’s early history, however, 
challenges both assumptions and suggests that they have tended to obscure the 
complexity and historicity of the genre.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
1. According to the passage, scholars have not given sensationalism serious 
consideration because they believe sensationalism
A. possesses largely emotional rather than rational content
B. is produced with an eye to making money
C. lacks historical complexity
2. In the contest in which it appears, “charged” most nearly means
A. electriﬁed
B. accused
C. attacked

Passage 345
Some economists suggest that all ﬁrms would be expected to pay workers doing identical 
jobs the same wage. However, studies show that high-proﬁt industries tend to pay more. 
While some of this observed wage gap could be due to difﬁculties in measuring workers' 
talent, it is unlikely that such measurement problems can explain everything. Although 
talent is hard to measure, factors with which it is presumably correlated, such as 
education and tenure, are not. Yet studies that control for those factors still ﬁnd big wage 
disparities. Moreover, although receptionists, for example, do not become less 
talented when they leave a high-proﬁt industry to work in an industry with lower 
proﬁts, their pay tends to drop in line with the wage gap between the two.【微信公

Passage 346
As they unearth long-ignored women's writings, some feminist literary scholars have a 
tendency to evaluate those writings according to current ideological standards. This 
tendency, however understandable, has certain pitfalls, as feminist response to three 
late-seventeenth-and early-eighteenth-century English female play wrights demonstrates. 
Mary Pix, Catharine Trotter, and Delarivier Manley each wrote at least four plays and 
were known collectively as the “Female Wits”. These women saw themselves as 
participating in a common endeavor, but feminist scholars have evaluated their works in 
very different terms. Trotter and Manley have been praised for their depiction of “feminist” 
themes. Trotter because of her insistence on feminine virtue, and Manley because of her 
depiction of strong, if sometimes villainous, heroines while Pix's works, because they 
depict women in ways now considered stereotypically “feminine”, are often dismissed.
Yet Pix is conservative only within a present-day context: within the context of late-
seventeenth-and early- eighteenth-century English drama, Pix's plays were more formally 
innovative than Manley's and more successful than either Manley's or Trotter's. She also 
broke new ground regarding subject matter, addressing contemporary social issues 
such as class upheaval. However, these acts are rarely acknowledged by scholars of 
the Female Wits.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. consider the consequences of a scholarly over sight
B. question the ideological consistency of certain literary critics
C. show the shortcomings of a critical propensity
D. discuss the contradictions inherent in a literary movement
E. demonstrate certain difﬁculties involved in unearthing obscure literary works
2. According to the passage, feminist literary scholars of the Female Wits have a 
tendency to 
A. overlook the originality of certain features of Pix's plays
B. exaggerate the stereotypically feminine characteristics of Pix's heroines 
C. dwell on the progressive nature of Pix's views on social issues
D. downplay the villainous nature of some of Manley's heroines 
E. misinterpret Trotter's insistence on feminine virtue
3. The author's reference to Pix's “addressing contemporary social issues such as class 
upheaval” serves primarily to
A. suggest that Pix's political and social views were stereotypically “feminine” 
B. identify a Pixian subject that feminist scholars have consistently misinterpreted
C. help explain why Pix's plays proved to be more successful than either Manley's or 
Trotter's 
D. support the claim that Pix's plays pursued previously unexplored topics 
E. identify a factor that contributed to the formal innovativeness of Pix's plays

Passage 347
In European lowland heathlands, heather bushes, grasses, and bracken compete with 
one another for the sandy soil's scarce nutrients, with none acquiring permanent 
dominance. In Dutch heathlands, however, atmospheric nitrogen pollution produced by 
intensive animal farming has turned heathlands into grassland, the result of an interaction 
between nitrogen pollution and heather-eating beetles. Additional nitrogen usually 
increases growth of both grass and heather, and at ﬁrst heather usually thrives because 
the grasses cannot penetrate the canopy of its bushes. Heather beetle population size, 
like that of many herbivorous insects, varies from year to year. When heather 
beetles are abundant, their larvae grow particularly well on the nitrogen-enriched heather 
shoots. Voraciously feeding larvae and adults then defoliate the bushes, tipping the 
competitive balance between heather and grasses irrevocably.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师
GRE】
7. It can be inferred from the passage that an abundance of heather beetles in Dutch 
heathlands 
A. may be prevented by the proper management of heathlands 
B. can be caused by a lack of atmospheric nitrogen
C. can result in grasses gaining increased access to sunlight
D. helps check the growth of a wide variety of plants
E. will inevitably be followed by years of heather beetle scarcity
8. Which of the followings best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the 
author's explanation?
A. It supplies information to explain changes in atmospheric nitrogen pollution.
B. It emphasizes the extent to which Dutch heathlands are ecologically fragile 
environments.
C. It provides an example of a factor beyond the control of those seeking to preserve 
heather bushes.
D. It suggests that the presence of intensive animal farming has been unfairly blamed for 
the demise of Dutch heathlands.
E. It explains why there might be a lag between increases in atmospheric nitrogen and 
damage to heather.

Passage 348
To evaluate any given intellectual property policy, we must weigh the costs and beneﬁts 
of awarding copyright protection. If an innovation, then the beneﬁts of the protection are 
nonexistent, and so, by the cost-beneﬁt criterion it is unwarranted. Such a situation arose 
in 1998, when the United States Congress extended the term of copyright from 50 years 
after an author's death to 70. Book buyers are harmed by this. A book's price is higher 
under copyright because the publisher continues to owe royalties to the author's heirs 
and does not compete with others printing the same book. Against that drawback, there 
is no countervailing beneﬁt. Authors are hardly likely to ﬁnd motivation in the 
prospect of earnings that will arrive more than 50 years after their death. Moreover, 
the extension was applied retroactively to existing copyrights but authors do not need 
incentives to write books they have already written.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
1. The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. argue that intellectual property policies are often unwarranted
B. show how a particular criterion can be used to evaluate an intellectual property policy
C. summarize the costs and beneﬁts of introducing intellectual property policies
D. approve the reasoning that was used to justify a particular intellectual property policy 
E. challenge a claim that the beneﬁts of intellectual property policies outweigh the costs
2. The author mentions “royalties” primarily in order to identify 
A. a beneﬁt that is likely to motivate authors
B. a way in which publishers compete with one another
C. a factor that contributes to a negative effect of copyright 
D. a reason underlying Congress’ actions regarding copyright 
E. an unintended effect of extending the term of copyright
3. It can be inferred that which of the following assumptions underlies the statement in 
the highlighted sentence?
A. Concern for their heirs is not a factor that motivates authors to publish.
B. Authors are motivated by factors other than the prospect of ﬁnancial gain. 
C. Sales of a book are unlikely to change after its author's death.
D. Publishers tend to act in their own best interest rather than in the author's 
E. The earnings of most authors tend to decline over time.

Passage 349
Mayor: Vehicle exhaust produces dangerously high ozone levels in our city in hot, humid 
weather. As an incentive for people to commute by bus rather than by car, special free 
commuter buses will be scheduled on hot, humid days. Since a bus can carry about 40 
people but produces only about 20 times as much exhaust as a car, ozone levels will be 
lower as long as the buses are more than half full.【微信公众号：张巍⽼师GRE】
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
A. Most of the people who would take the special free buses are currently members of 
carpools.
B. The city does not currently have enough buses to transport all of the commuters who 
normally commute by car. 
C. Buses that would be operating on hot, humid days would rarely, if ever, be ﬁlled to 
capacity.
D. The amount of vehicle exhaust produced in the city is not signiﬁcantly higher on hot, 
humid days. 
E. Not all commuter routes are used by enough people to warrant providing bus service 
for them.

Passage 350
Sensations of nausea in people are accompanied by higher-than-normal blood levels of a 
particular hormone, vasopressin. Therefore, either nausea triggers the production of 
vasopressin or abnormally high levels of vasopressin cause nausea.【微信公众号：张巍

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? 
A. Sensations of nausea are never present when vasopressin is at low levels.
B. High levels of vasopressin have no effect on the body other than to cause sensations 
of nausea.
C. Sensations of nausea and high levels of vasopressin do not have a common cause 
that makes them occur together.
D. Mild nausea causes the release of small quantities of vasopressin, and high levels of 
vasopressin cause intense nausea.
E. People differ in the blood level of vasopressin that is normal for them.


Passage 1 
1. 答案：B
解析：文章首句作为背景指出关于主题：基于发展情景中鱼的社会认知研究（相对于个体研
究）的不足。二句重点引入C, W, K 的研究：关注鱼群密度与认知学习（后续觅食成功）的
关系。他们做对比实验：小群中长大的G 鱼比大群中的G 鱼更快发现食物。后文进一步解
释：大群中成长的G 鱼更少学习。总之，该研究验证了社会环境与认知的关系。 
该题问文章主旨目的，可知B 最准确。A 选项错在flaw, 此题C 选项最有诱惑性，C 选项没
有提到文章前两句关于实验的内容，只说到了后面的结论，所以不如B 选项完整。D 错，文
章就介绍了一个研究发现。E 选项只概括了研究中的对比。 
2. 答案：D
解析：该题只能选项定位。D 选项可以定位到文章首句，是其同义改写：Although social 
learning (the acquisition of specific behaviors by observing other individuals exhibiting those 
behaviors ) is well documented among fish, few studies have investigated social learning 
within a develop mental context in these taxa. 
3. 答案：D
解析：根据人名定位到第二句之后。D 选项正确。文章说，他们的实验是针对laboratory-
housed guppies 做的，文章最后一句总结是针对所有G 鱼类说的（包括野生G 鱼）可知作
者默认了D 选项正确，否则不能得出最后一句结论。【在逻辑单题中，这题的D 选项实际就
是文章的一个假设，因为如果实验室的鱼和野外的鱼是不一样的话，则文章里面的结论都是
无效的】 
Passage 2 
1. 解析：文章首段主要介绍一个矛盾现象：H 写了两个版本，1935 年版本和1929 年版本。
矛盾的是：35 年发表的版本不同于最初的29 年版本。二段给出原因解释，进而作出评论。 
由对矛盾现象的解释可以定位到第二段的第一句“While we cannot know for certain why 
Hurston’s original manuscript went unpublished during her lifetime, it may have been 
because publishers wanted something more than a transcription of tales. ” 
2. 答案：E
解析：original version 指的是1929 年未发表的版本。A 选项中与编辑交流在文中早不到依
据。而且作者推测1935 年版本才是与编辑交流的结果；B 选项中最小化Hurston 自己的陈
述以最大化材料，在文中找不到对应的依据；选项C 说将手稿放置一边以期在将来出版时
赢得最多潜在的读者，在文中也无依据。而且1929 年版本在当时没有被出版的，因此Hurston
自己也不可能预计以后的出版情况；选项D 说Hurston 不情愿的删除了一些编辑不满意的


因素，文中也没有提到。只是作者推测1935 年版本的某些内容是应编辑的要求添加的；选
项E 说Hurston 决定不添加评论内容，还原故事本来面貌，对应文中“This version differs 
from Mules and Men in that it simply records stories, with no descriptive or interpretive 
information.”其中this version 指的是1929 年版，即original version。 
Passage 3 
答案：C 
解析：题目问文章论证基于的假设。文章中心结论是中间这句：so psychologists have 
speculated that sharply increasing Internet use can cause depression 增加上网时间会引起抑
郁。文章理由以该句结论为界，分为前后两个部分：前半部分理由看起来是一个链状推理：
减少面对面社交会引起抑郁。用来上网的时间不能用于面对面社交。后半部分理由是一个对
比研究：最近增加两倍上网时间的常规网络用户比没有增加的常规网络用户有更高的抑郁
发生率。前后两半部分理由哪一部分有漏洞呢？问题出在前半部分！它貌似一个链状推理，
但它与严密支持结论的链状推理之间是有出入的。 
这样一个链状推理才是严密的，无懈可击的： 
理由1：减少面对面社交会引起抑郁 
理由2：增加上网的时间会减少面对面社交时间 
结论：增加上网时间会引起抑郁 
问题是：即使用来上网的时间不能用于面对面社交（原文表达），但是否能增加每天其他时
间的面对面社交机会呢？比如，上网用来dating,上网之后意犹未尽，相约面对面热聊啦！
如果出现这种情况，原文推理就不是我们需要的严密推理啦！所以，文章推理依据的假设就
是要排除这种情况。就是C 选项。 
Passage 4 
1. 答案：D
解析：文章两段是典型的对比结构。一段是美国黑人戏剧最近之前的主导流派：自然主义。
自然主义的典型特征是反映现实生活，人物命运决定于现实环境。二段是以AK 为代表的最
近变化：超现实主义，远离自然主义。塑造人物不依赖于与外部环境的联系。 
该题问文章主旨，D 最准确。 
A 选项只概括了首段内容。B 选项概括主题偏离，没有体现对比变化。C 选项无视二段内容。
E 选项best 概念原文无，且没有体现一段。 
2. 答案：A


解析：该题问K 的艺术主张。A 选项定位到2 段该句：The overall goal of her work has been 
to depict the world of the soul and thespirit, not to mirror concrete reality。由此可知选A。 
3. 答案：C
解析：该题问最能加强作者论断（K 的作品远离首段提及的自然主义传统）的选项。C 最合
适。K 只使用古代神话传说中人物形象。意思是K 的人物角色不依赖于周围环境。这与首段
自然主义风格最相反：Naturalism sees each individual as inextricably bound to the 
environment and depicts each person as someone controlled by, instead of controlling, 
concrete reality. 
Passage 5 
1. 答案：C
解析：文章首段首先介绍一个理论难题：关于invasibility 原因没有统一意见。However 后，
作者指出，一种基于资源波动的理论能解决该理论难题。二段详细介绍该理论。该理论主要
用resource-release mechanisms 来解释invasibility,否定物种丰富性的解释。 
这道题是典型的主旨题。选项A 说是评价一个理论的实验观察上的成功。但原文中并没有
讲到实验观察的地方，而是理论上的推测；选项B 说解释了为什么某一现象没有一致的理论
原因，但文章主要讲了新理论如何解决旧理论的不一致性，而不是“为什么”的问题；选项
C 说支持了一种有潜力可以解决原有理论僵局的新理论，符合题意；选项D 说由一个理论
推测出了可以被检测的推论，但文中并没有提到推论，也没有提到检测问题；选项E 说描述
了解释某些特定实验结果的困难。原文中只由第一段说某些原有假说与实验结果不一致，并
非全文都在描述困难。 
2. 答案：B
解析：根据fieldstudies 定位到文章首段，however 转折后，previous studies 仍指field studies。
选项B 是对转折后的概括。 
3. 答案：E
解析：根据高亮关键词定位首段。尽管关键词出现在首段，因二段是对首段理论的详细展开，
答案很可能出现在二段。E 选项定位该句Since 原因从句：Inparticular, the theory predicts 
that there will be no necessary relationship between the species diversity of a plant 
community and its susceptibility to invasion, since near-complete exploitation can each occur 
in both species-richand species-poor communities。该句用来否定物种多样性的解释，因为
不同的（物种丰富）情况会有一样的结果：（外来物种）的几乎彻底开发利用。 


Passage 6 
1. 答案：ABC
解析：文章首句指出最近研究与之前怀疑者观点的矛盾：怀疑者认为北极地区降温，最近研
究发现升温。后文依次列举方式解释了几个原因：1 雪和冰的反射，2 空气稀薄，3 少蒸发
损耗。 
该题问可能导致地球极地温度大幅变化（swing）因素，定位到文章中2 句：several factors 
lead to greater temperature swings at Earths polar regions。可知ABC 都正确。 
2. 答案：C
解析：该题问文章中skeptics（猜疑者）指出格棱兰地区温度变化的目的，定位到首句，可
知C 选项：他们认为温度是向相反方向变化的（reversal of the temperature trend）,他们认
为以格陵兰为代表的整个北极地区温度是下降的,这与主流观点，recent scientific report 的
结论是相反的。B 选项不准确，等于把格陵兰当作北极地区的例外特例，而不是原文表达的
典型代表。 
Passage 7 
1. 答案：D
解析：全文首句介绍很多历史学家对CM 的传记的观点：关注虔诚性，牺牲历史准确性。Yet
转折后，是作者对CM 传记的正面评价，反驳了对CM 的指责。 
该题A 选项说反驳了一个历史界通行的理论，但文中并没有提到任何理论；B 说是一个不同
寻常的记录历史时代的方法，但文中显然也没有提到任何方法；C 说总结了关于一个历史人
物的研究，但显然文章并没有全部在说某一个历史人物的研究工作。文中提到了
GovernorJohn Winthrop，目的是为了说明Mather 的critical observations；D 说反驳了关于
某个传记作家某部作品的一些看法，纵观全文，作者的确是一直反驳一些历史学家对于
Mather 的传记的看法，正确；E 说指出了矛盾的历史报告的微妙不同，显然与主题已无关。 
2. 答案：E
解析：问题问的是支持Mather 传记的准确性的最有力证据，Yet 转折后作者评价说，modern 
studies have profited both from the breadth of information that Mather provides …… and 
from his critical observations of ….. 后文是对该评价的展开。可知选E 最有力，
quantitty=breadth, nature=critical observation. 
3. 答案：E
解析：选项A 中的annals 在原文中找不到对应，排除；B 中说对Governor Winthrop 的描述
暴露了其所有缺点，这个在文中没有提到；C 说Mather 写传记主要基于自己的亲身经历，


 
 
原文中找不到对应，且与Mather amassed all sorts of publishedand unpublished documents 
as sources 相违背；D 说biography is an inherently unreliable genre of historical writing 在原
文中找不到对应。而且历史学家只是批评Mather，并未涉及历史写作类型；E 选项可定位至
“The charge also obscures Mather’s concern with the settlers material,not just spiritual, 
prosperity. ”正确。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：B 
 
解析：根据题干定位到文章第一句，根据endowing their subjects with saintly piety 可以选
出B 选项。 
 
Passage 8 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：题目要求加强文章结论。文章针对Mediterraneanmonk seals 的大量死亡。文章提出
两个可能原因：1 是不明病毒，2 是有毒细菌。然后根据海水样本发现的有毒细菌，认为死
亡是由有毒细菌引起的。加强结论的选项就要支持有毒细菌论，削弱乃至否定病毒论。 
 
D 选项支持力度最大，用的是逆否命题的思路：如果是病毒引起的，应该有大量小海豹死亡。
现在只有成年海豹死亡，没有小海豹死亡，所以不是病毒原因。从而大大支持了有毒细菌论。 
 
Passage 9 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：这是一道文章主旨题。文章开始讲主流观点：抵制消费的政治上的利用起源于美国。
However 之后, 介绍MaryODowd 的相反观点：爱尔兰的妇女抵制进口品的历史可以追溯到
17 世纪，它是有自己的历史的。因此答案选D。A 选项不准确，作者的立场并不明确。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：高亮的句子为“Breendid acknowledge that a few isolated boycotts may have taken 
place in other countries.”这一句的上一句是说Breen 认为抵制消费活动起源于美国，显然
高亮句是B 做的让步。A 选项最准确（qualify 翻译成限制，限定）。下一句是Mary 的完全
相反的观点：抵制行为起源于爱尔兰，D 选项不正确，高亮句不是为后句的观点提供合理性。 
 
Passage 10 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：该题要求加强论证。文章结论是：最近的要求运输小石子的卡车加盖帆布的法律不能
减少飞溅石子对后续车辆造成的伤害，理由是，石子从车厢飞溅出来的可能性远远小于从轮
胎缝隙飞溅出来的可能性。 


 
 
 
A 选项加强作用最强。加盖帆布，后续车辆更可能靠近运输石子的卡车，从而提高受伤害的
概率（虽然盖帆布降低了从车厢飞溅石子的机率，但没有降低从轮胎缝隙飞溅的机率）。 
 
B 选项说很多司机已经携带帆布，但携带不等于加盖。 
 
C 选项考虑的是所有伤害的问题，过于宽泛。 
 
D 选项讨论的是空车状态，完全无关。 
 
E 选项开得慢不能支持碎石头是来自轮胎缝。 
 
Passage 11 
 
1. 答案：AC 
 
解析：文章首先说1970 年代女权主义文学批评出现前对FF 评价：当作维护传统价值情感
主义代表。女权主义兴起后，强调FF 非情感因素，尖锐社会批评。新问题出现：如何协调
社会批评和传统价值的矛盾。H 尝试解决：用感情修辞掩饰激进变革目标。T 提出针对感情
主义自身的替代解释：可以通过左右读者情感方式服务激进变革目标。 
 
该题问这对高亮句中矛盾的正确表述。A 选项可以通过首句得知。C 选项可从3 句Most 
feminist scholars find 得知。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：该题问T 最会支持的针对文章中评论者的表述。T 的观点立场体现在最后一句：T 提
出针对感情主义自身的替代解释：可以通过左右读者情感方式服务激进变革目标。DE 选项
之中。D 选项更好。之前评论者有insipid 的明显负评价。原文末句T 的观点，等于承认之
前评论者至少认识到感情主义可以服务于保守主义目标，不能等同于E 选项，完全意识不到
情感主义的作用。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：C 
 
解析：信息目的题。文中提到humorous social criticism 就是想和之前评论家的观点形成对
比，从而引发出下文所说的contradiction，本题选C。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：B 
 
解析：词汇题。本题容易根据字面意思，误选E 选项。reclamation 在此处体现出critics 和
feminist scholars 二者态度的不同，critics 先给出一个负评价，而feminist 给出正向评价，故
而B 选项更符合态度的变化。 
 
 


 
 
Passage 12 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：题目要求找论证基于的假设。文章理由是：新型植物汽车燃料比传统汽油更高效，环
境污染更少，价格也更便宜。结论是：司机转用新型植物汽油的话，能降低每年燃油花费，
还能减少环境破坏。注意文章理由到结论的概念跳跃：理由讨论的是单位（例如每升）问题，
结论是消耗／排放总量问题。作者忽略了另外的重要变量：驾驶里程的总量问题。D 选项指
出该被忽略变量不应有不利变化，是文章推理基于的假设。 
 
Passage 13 
 
1. 答案：A 
解析：文章首句介绍老观点：鸟产卵是受制于能量和营养消耗的。2 句之后，L 提出不同观
点：产蛋规模受制于父母成功饲养的能力。后续研究发现，自己觅食的种类（P）产蛋规模
受制于其他因素。潜在意思是说，父母饲养的种类（A），成功饲养的能力有可能是重要的，
但老观点也是有其道理的。该题问的是首句生物学家的观点，定位可知A 选项。 
 
2. 答案：AC 
 
解析：该题问L 关于产卵规模的观点，选项定位可知A 和C。 
 
A 选项定位到：Hesuggested that clutch size had instead evolved in relation to the number 
ofyoung that the parents could successfully rear. Subsequently, most studiesfocused on 
limitations operating during chick rearing, particularly amongaltricial species (species in which 
the parents feed their young in the nest). 
 
C 选项定位到：Lack,however, suggested that clutch size—the number of eggs a bird lays 
perbreeding cycle—isfar below the potential limit of egg production. （文章末句发现并未否
定该观点）。 
 
Passage 14 
 
1. 答案：AB 
 
解析：文章首句是作者对Peterson 的作品价值的总体评论；第二句将其研究与另一位学者
Fosters 相比较。三句之后主要强调Peterson 和Fosters 的区别。 
 
本题问的是Peterson认为女性面临的障碍有哪些，定位到“Petersonsees these same women 
as having been fundamentally estranged from the nation bya dominant culture 
unsympathetic to Black women, and by a Black intelligentsia whose male view of race 
concerns left little room for Black female intellect. ”一句，可知选A 和B 选项。 
 
2.答案：A 


 
 
 
解析：此题问的是Peterson 和Fosters 研究的相似之处，定位到原文的“Its scope resembles 
that of Frances Smith Fosters 1993 study, but its approach isquite different.”一句，可知选
A。 
 
Passage 15 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章的结构比较简单明了，先说Belasco 的现实主义戏剧引起了公众轰动；转折后说
进步戏剧评论家对其负评价，戏剧评论家拥护New Stagecraft theories, 反对theatrical 
literalism. 
 
该题定位至原文“While Belasco’s meticulously detailed reproduction of an immediately 
recognizable setting impressed the public, it was derided by progressive theater critics ”一
句可知答案选D。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：问题中问的是戏剧评论家的看法，定位至原文“The New Stagecraft rejected theatrical 
literalism; it drew inspiration from the subjectivity and minimalism of modern painters, 
advocating simplified sets designed to express a dramatic texts central ideas. ……a trueartist 
eliminated the inessential to create more meaningful, expressive stage images. ”可知选B 选
项。 
 
Passage 16 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：文章理由是：S 的电视新闻工作者是其他行业工人B 政党支持率的两倍，S 的新闻专
业学生对B 政党的支持率比S 的电视新闻工作者更高。 
 
文章结论是：假设新闻专业不改变政党支持，随着新闻专业学生参加工作，当前的S 的电视
新闻工作者是其他行业工人B 政党支持率之间的显著差异会进一步扩大。 
 
考虑否定结论的可能情况：1S 新闻专业学生毕业不在本地工作，2S 新闻专业学生大部分不
从事电视新闻工作，3 参加电视新闻工作的S 新闻专业学生大部分不支持B 政党，而参加其
他行业的S 新闻专业学生大部分支持B 政党。等等。D 选项正确。取非D 选项：希望参加
电视新闻工作的S 新闻专业学生比S 新闻专业学生作为整体有显著更低的B 政党支持率。
如果这样的话，则破坏结论：差异不会进一步扩大，甚至缩小。 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 17 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章首先介绍早期自然主义者的观点：北美有两种beaver, dam beavers, bankbeavers, 
bank beavers 不会筑坝。In fact 之后，作者指出，bank beaver 不需要筑坝，它们会筑坝，
必要的时候才筑坝。 
 
该题定位至原文“In fact, damsare primarily a strategy for dealing with annual variations in 
water levels. Ifwater levels fall in summer, as they do in most of North America, then 
beaverslodge entrances may be exposed. With stabilized water levels, their homes aremuch 
safer.”可知答案选A。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：从文章结构分析可知，作者否定了用是否会筑坝作为beaver 分类的依据，两种beaver
都会筑坝，可以当作同一个物种。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：AB 
 
解析：本题考点与第一题有重合，选AB。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：D 
 
解析：本题考点与第二题有重合，选D。 
 
Passage 18 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：首段用对比（大小不般配的天体相撞／大小类似的天体相撞）方式，引入大碰撞对月
亮起源的解释。 
 
二段详细介绍大碰撞说对月亮起源的解释：该理论能解释之前解释的诸多不足。 
 
三段作者把大碰撞说引申到其他行星，文章末尾表达了作者谨慎乐观的态度。 
 
该题所问高亮句子是“Massive projectiles striking much larger bodies createvarious kinds of 
craters, including multi-ring basins–the largest geologic features observed on planets and 
moons”，下一句是“In such collisions, the impactor is completely destroyed and itsmaterial 
is incorporated into the larger body. ”，由此可知选D. 
 
2. 答案：E 
 


 
 
解析：该题问作者对titannic collision 模型的观点，定位至原文“Such conjectures are 
tempting,but, since no early planet was immune to titanic impacts, they could be 
usedindiscriminately 
to 
explain 
away 
in 
a 
cavalier 
fashion 
every 
unusual 
planetarycharacteristic ”一句可知选E。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：根据问题中的关键词compounds and elements 可定位至原文“The difficulty in 
recondensing this vapor in Earth’s orbit, and its subsequent loss to the vacuum of outer 
space, might account for the observed absence in lunar rocks of certain readily vaporized 
compounds and elements.”可知月球上现在已经没有某些compounds and elements 了，
而这是与地球相比较的结果而言，所以地球上是还有这些物质的，选E。C 选项不准确，根
据原文，这些元素从来没有在月亮存在过：The difficulty in recondensing this vapor in 
Earth’s orbit, and its subsequent loss to the vacuum of outer space，含有这些元素的气体
难于在月亮的旋转轨道凝固，直接流失到太空了。 
 
4. 答案：A 
 
解析：问题针对第二段的主旨。从文章结构分析可知，第二段是用Titanic collision impacts
理论解释月亮起源，该理论能解释之前理论无法解释的一些特殊现象。所以选A。 
 
Passage 19 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：通读全文可知，文章以分类方式介绍探究印刷术产生之前罗马文献流传历史的方法。 
 
首段首句引入主题，指出指出探究罗马文本流传情况的两种证据：内部证据和外部证据。接
着介绍内部证据。作者对该类证据持偏负面态度，认为其may paint a distorted picture. 
 
二段介绍一种外部证据：中世纪的一个文本。作者认为该类证据也不能准确表明当时的真实
情况。 
 
三段介绍另一种外部证据：引用。作者对其也是偏负面态度：引用的未必是一手资料。 
 
四段总结，警告过度概括的倾向。 
 
该题问文章主旨。A 选项侧重于changes，然而文章中并没有相应内容。D 说提倡某一种证
据，但文中没有体现作者的偏好；E 选项是细节。BC 选项中，B 选项说“对比”了研究古罗
马文献的证据，文章有分类，但对几种分类证据都是负面评价，“对比”不准确；C 选项说
列举了研究古罗马文献流传过程中的困难，正确；所以选C。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 


 
 
解析：根据关键词stemma 定位至原文“Internal evidence is used to reconstruct the 
relationship of the surviving manuscripts of a Roman text to one another, as representedin a 
modern stemma codicum: a diagram depicting the genealogical relationship of surviving 
manuscripts and those the stemmas editor believes existed at onetime.”可知stemma 是用
来构建“代际关系”的，所以选D。 
 
3.答案：AB 
 
解析：细节理解题，主要依靠原文对应，按照文章内容进行选择。定位到原文“It is equally 
possible that the work survived far into the MiddleAges in numerous copies in monastic 
libraries but were unnoticed due to lack ofinterest.”可知选A、B.定位到“Quotations from 
a Roman text by a medieval author are another category of external evidence: but does the 
appearance of a rare word or grammatical construction—or even a short passage—really 
indicate a medieval author’s firsthand knowledge of this or that ancient work, or does such 
usage instead derive from some intermediate source, such as a grammar book or a popular 
style manual? ”可知不选C。 
 
4. 解析：由“underestimate”定位到“Conversely, the stemma can also bestow a semblance 
of separation on manuscripts written within a few months of one another or even in the same 
room.” 
 
Passage20 
 
答案：A 
 
解析： 
 
文章首段首先介绍一个具体发现：1995 年发现木星大气缺乏之前预测的气态水，进而指出
该发现的意义：复制地球生命的条件可能性很低。 
 
二段、三段详细展开地球生命所需的4 种偶然条件：1 地球公转轨道不大不小。2 木星的保
护作用。3 木星保护的偶尔失灵带来地球生命所需要的重要物质。4 卫星月球的稳定作用。 
 
该题关于文章主旨。通读全文可知本文主要介绍了地球生物圈形成的四个条件，由原文
“Recently planetary scientists have suggested that the externalpreconditions for the 
development of Earth’s biosphereprobably included four paramount contingencies. ”可知
选A。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：本题根据complex life forms on Earth 可以定位到第二段最后一句，可知，地球上生
物存在的条件不仅要和地球自己的条件吻合，还得和太阳系中其他的条件吻合，故本题选E。 
 
3. 答案：E 


 
 
 
解析：定位到原文“Finally,Earth’s unique and massive satellite, the Moon, plays a crucial 
role instabilizing the obliquity of Earth’s rotational axis, this obliquity createsthe terrestrial 
seasonality so important to the evolution and diversity oflife. Mars, in contrast, has a wildly 
oscillating tilt and chaotic seasonality,while Venus, rotating slowly backward, has virtually no 
seasonality at all. ”通过对比有卫星和没有卫星的不同情况，可知选E。 
 
4. 答案：B 
 
解析：排除题。文中只有“Thus theevolution of life has depended on a frequency of cometary 
impacts sufficient toconvey water, as well as carbon and nitrogen”一句，并未提到水、碳、
氮的先后顺序。 
 
Passage 21 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析： 
 
文章首段主要介绍女权主义的的历史观：建立独立于传统男权主义的女权主义历史。文章二
段是作者的评论：女权主义历史观有缺陷，主要是会贬低历史上女性作家的贡献。 
 
该题根据关键词Rosalind Miles 和third millennium B.C 定位到原文“Rosalind Miles’s 
description restates the popular view: Women’s history by contrast has only just begun to 
inventitself. Males gained entry to the business of recording, defining and interpreting events 
in the third millennium B.C.; for women, this process didnot even begin until the nineteenth 
century.”可知选D。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：由关键词herstory 定位到首次出现位置：“Feminist accounts of the 1970sand 1980s 
viewed historiography (the writing of history) as overwhelmingly his,coining the term herstory 
and presenting it as a compensatory feminist practice”可知选E。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 
解析：根据关键词Mary Astell 定位到原文二段：“Astell, like those who echoed hersentiments 
two and a half centuries later, must be credited for admirable zealin setting out to right 
scholarly wrongs, but her supposition that historianswere only male is inaccurate.”可知选C。 
 
4. 答案：A 
 
解析：根据关键词Astell’ssupposition 定位到原文“Astell’sjudgment is at the same time 
understandable, given that much historical writingby women of the late seventeenth century 


 
 
was not published until the nineteenthcentury. ”可知选A。 
 
Passage 22 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析： 
 
通读全文可知文章主要介绍了历史学家们对忠诚于联邦的南方人的研究的演变过程。 
 
首段，1930 年之前，很少有人注意到这一研究议题，30 年代开创此研究领域，但有诸多不
足；重复南部政府观点，忽略个人特定身份和经验等。 
 
二段，介绍60－70 年代该研究领域进展，主要是从政治、经济角度理解南部反叛者。 
 
三段，最近的研究进展，开始关注地方特点，个人经验。 
 
该题问文章主要目的，从文章结构分析可知答案选B。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：根据关键词定位到文章三段。通过三段主旨和之前段落的区别可以确定C 选项，只有
该选项最能体现三段最新研究的特点：地方性、个人性。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 
解析：锁定关键词before 1930 可知定位到原文“Until around 1930 few United StatesCivil 
War historians paid much attention to Southerners who opposed the1861-1865 secession 
from the United States by a confederacy of Southern states.”选C。 
 
4. 答案：D 
 
解析：高亮句 “emphasis has been placed on the ways loyalist Southerners diverged from 
the political and economic mainstream of Confederate nationalism.”是二段最后一句。它的
功能既要考虑和前文，尤其是二段的关系，也要考虑和后文三段的关系。三段首句 “Only 
recently have some CivilWar historians begun to make Unionists and their experiences, rather 
thanthe Confederate state, the center of inquiry”说明后来的研究者已经将研究的重心转移
到了别的方面，因此选D。 
 
Passage 23 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章是典型新书内容介绍加评论。 


 
 
 
第一段先介绍了Louis Gerteis 新书中的观点，北部改革者从1803 年代就攻击南部奴隶制，
用的是功利自由主义价值观：个人应该有实现个人最大利益的自由。 
 
第二段把Louis Gerteis 的观点置入大的理论框架：Growth of a Dissenting Minority 
interpretation, 然后讲述了历史学家对该理论框架的反驳理由。 
 
最后一段则主要是作者的评论，认为是Gerteis 为Growth interpretation 赋予新的活力，主
要理由是强调Gerteis 和之前该观点阵营的区别。 
 
本题考察文章大意，通过文章结构分析，可知C 选项最准确。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：第二段中历史学家批评Growthinterpretation 会“homogenize thepolitical diversity of 
Northern reformers”，而第三段中的Gerteis“does notreduce the Northern reformers to a 
homogeneous group or try to argue that thereformers shared views undermined their 
differing party loyalties”因此Gerteis formulation of the Growthinterpretation 可能会比传统
的解释更为可信。所以选D。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 
解析：由第二段中的“this interpretive framework, which once dominated antislavery 
historiography”可知这一理论原本非常有影响力；第三段中“Gerteis revives the Growth 
interpretation”可知它被赋予新的解释，所以选C。 
 
4. 答案：E 
 
解析：本题是选择最不能支持Gerteis 理论的情况，重点找和原文陈述矛盾的选项。定位到
原文第三段：Nevertheless,Gerteis argues, these disparate party affiliations did not diminish 
theactuality of reformer unity, most prominent in the 1830s. …… Gerteis differsfrom traditional 
adherents of the Growth framework by asserting that the basic elements in the antislavery 
coalition were firmly in place and accepted by all elements in the Northern reform community 
as early as the late 1830s. 可知E 选项和原文矛盾。 
 
5. 【新增题目】答案：A 
 
解析：信息目的题注意到emerging scholarship 是出现在文中第二段的位置，作为the second 
reason 来discounted this interpretive framework，本题选A。 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 24 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章首段从 E.H Carr 的论文引入历史学界的一个关键问题：历史事件是否存在原因
的主次顺序。马克思主义者认为存在，坚持经济因素是所有事件的首要原因。经典的韦伯社
会学派认为特定事件有特定原因，但仍认为存在主因。作者引用韦伯本人反驳了主因说。 
 
    第二段介绍Runciman 的与作者立场殊途同归的研究思路：很难区分事件主因和背景
条件，从而很难确定事件主因。 
 
    该题问文章主要目的，从文章结构分析，可知选项D 最准确，文章主要是对传统观念
提出了挑战。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：抓住关键点“most historians share the assumption”，定位到原文开头“Historian E.H 
Carr’s thesis that all debates concerning the explanation of historical phenomena revolve 
around the question of the priority of causes is so familiar to historians as to constitute 
orthodoxy within their profession……可知选B。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：由关键词“indispensable cause”定位到首段：If any historical event is the product of 
a number of factors, then each of these factor is indispensable to the occurrence of the event. 
But howcan one cause be more indispensable than another? And if it cannot, how canthere 
be a hierarchy of indispensable causes?由首段结构关系可知E 选项最准确。 
 
4. 答案：A 
 
解析：本问考查文章结构。由文章结构分析可知A 选项最准确。 
 
Passage 25 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：本文是典型的人物成就介绍加评论。 
 
首段上来说，现代女权主义给予MW 她本人值得的评价。尽管一度被人低估，MW 关于性
别道德的立场现在仍有价值。二段详细介绍MW 的性别道德立场：男女应该真正平等，反
对当时流行的感伤主义文学的性别立场。三段从一个特定角度展开MW 的思想：对Edmund 
Burke 的评论。作者认为，Edmund Burke 把传统上对女性的态度应用到贵族，MW 正确地
反对了该做法。 
 
本题问高亮句作用，高亮句子为三段“A defender of Burke called Wollstonecraft’s 
book an incoherent mass of treacherous candour, interested generosity, and, if not false, at 
least unnecessary accusation.”主要是Burke 的支持者对MW 的批评，所以选E。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：此问考察了Burke 描述法国王后的句子的作用，定位到3 段上下文“Burke’s 
rhapsodyon the queen of France (glittering like the morning star, full of life, andsplendor, and 
joy) was, for Wollstonecraft, an example of the argument that beauty and instinct must often 
prevail over reason, the argument on which Burketook his stand as a defender of the old 
order.”结合3 段结构，该内容出现的位置是MW 和Edmund Burke 的支持者的分歧争论。
可知A 选项最准确，为MW 争论的一个立场提供例证。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：问题针对作者对于Virginia Woolf 对A Vindication ofthe Rights of Men and A 
Vindication of the Rights of Woman 的评论的看法。对应原文“Virginia Woolf wrote in 1925 
of Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Men and A Vindication of the Rights of 
Woman that they felt like books so true that they seem now to contain nothing new in them, 
it was more a wishful than an accurate statement of the case.“可知Virginia Woolf 非常赞赏
这本书的观点，但是作者评论说it was more a wishful thanan accurate，即作者并不认同self-
evident 的说法，所以选B。 
 
4. 答案：A 
 
解析：问题考察现代女权主义对于MW 作品的态度，定位原文首段首句“Modern feminism 
has brought the reputation of the English writer Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) to 
something approaching the luster it deserves. 首段后文说，…beginning in the nineteenth 
century her fame as a writer was hiddenby disproportionate attention to her unconventional 
and, at the time, shockingpersonal life.”即现代女权主义者高度认可MW，区分开之前对
MW 私人生活的负面评价。所以A 最准确。 
 
Passage 26 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：高亮句句子功能题 
 
理清文章结构思路：文章开头介绍传统实践（首句高亮句），需要闭合愈合的伤口通常需要
缝针。However 转折后说，降低医疗费用的压力不断增大，Consequently 句是作者的核心结
论，也就是针对新实践的预测：一种帮助伤口愈合的黏合剂会成为新的常规实践。也就是说，
虽然这个题划线句子是第一句，但是prediction 却是consequently 后面那句话。文章后文
（包括第2 句高亮句）是对于核心结论（预测）的论述：由于黏合剂价格不比缝针贵，也不
需要拆线，所以对于粘合剂也可以闭合的伤口，还是使用黏合剂更合算。由文章结构思路分


 
 
析，可知E 选项最准确。D 选项后半部分错误地判断了文章的主要结论。 
 
Passage 27 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：首段切入主题：新研究质疑旧观点。旧观点是：冰川间期是一贯地温暖的。 
 
二段展开新研究情况：GRIP, GISP2, 两个通过研究格陵兰深层冰川了解当时气候的项目。三
段详细介绍GRIP 研究的机制。气候温暖，积雪中O-18 多于O-16。气候寒冷，风更强，更
多dust and calcium ions. 四段，尽管两个项目有矛盾之处，GRIP 被认为更可靠。 
 
    该题问文章主旨。从文章结构分析可确定选C 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：通过三段对GRIP 项目的机制描述，可知其主要特征为：通过对现在能发现的古代冰
层中的物质构成分析推知当时的气候状况。E 选项最相似：通过现在能发现的证据推知早期
情况，所以选E。 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：注意关键点“prior to the GRIPfindings”可以定位到原文的第一段“Based on 
evidence from tree rings, pollen samples and other records,scientists have for a long time 
assumed that interglacials—warm interludes between ice ages—were as mild and uniform as 
the Holocene, the present interglacial, has been for all of its 8,000 to 10,000 years. ”和第三
段“Findings from the upper sections of the cores have confirmed what scientists already 
knew climate during the last ice age fluctuated rapidly.”从而选D。 
 
4. 答案：C 
 
解析：根据关键词oxygen-16 andoxygen-18 定位到原文“When the air was warm, vapor 
containing the heavier isotope, oxygen-18,condensed and formed precipitation, in the form 
of snow, more readily than didvapor containing oxygen-16. Thus, snow that fell during 
warmer periods contains proportionally more oxygen-18 than snow deposited during cold 
spells. ”可知oxygen-16 andoxygen-18 含量会随冷暖波动，热，O-18 多，冷，O-16 多。
又知：Data from GRIPseem to indicate that the Eemian climate swung at least as wildly as 
theclimate of ice age periods. 气候冷热有波动。选C。 
 
Passage 28 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章首先之处早期寿险公司面临的问题，之后介绍解决该问题的方法：选取了解当地


 
 
情况，的德高望重人士担任经纪人。末句总结纠正误解：经纪制度的首要功能不是拉客，而
是复制“熟人社会心态”。通过全文结构分析可知A 最准确。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：根据关键词cityneighborhoods 定位到原文末句:…but, rather, to recreate the glass-
bowl mentality associated with smalltowns or city neighborhoods. 可知选D。 
 
Passage 29 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章先介绍了传统的关于Younger Dryas 成因的理论解释：the release of waterfrom 
glacial Lake Agassiz 导致全球气温变低。However 转折后，作者阐述了新发现对于这一结论
的挑战， 
 
    该题根据关键词“the release of waterfrom glacial Lake Agassiz”定位到原文“For 
years, the leading theory for what caused the Younger Dryas was a release of water from 
Glacial Lake Agassiz……However, evidence has emerged that the Younger Dryas began long 
before fresh water flooded the North Atlantic.”可知选D 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：问题考察文章大意，根据文章结构可知应该选A。 
 
Passage 30 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章首段首先介绍研究者认为火星从来没有湿热期的观点及理由：火星大部分表面是
由未风化材料组成的。黑体句是研究者用来支持自己观点的假设推理。文章二段是作者的质
疑：科学家看得不仔细，新证据表明火星表面是有风化材料的。 
 
       该题问科学家们通过什么发现了火星表面的weathered material。回到原文“New 
high-resolution mapping data and close-up surface studies haverevealed clays and other 
hydrated minerals in many regions”可知选B。A 选项不如B 准确，文章二段提到 craters, 
但数据研究针对 manyregions, 不仅仅volcanic craters。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：高亮的句子是“If water flowed foran extended period, researchers reasoned, it should 
have altered and weathered the volcanic minerals, creating clays or other oxidized, hydrated 
phases (minerals that incorporate water molecules in their crystal structure) ”科学家推测如
果水流经过，会形成泥土或其他水相关物质。A 说揭示了为什么火星上找水很困难，显然不


 
 
符合；B 说成功的指出了水流经火星表面的结果，正确；C 说这是基于水和火山矿物质相互
反应的错误的假设，文中没有提到。所以选B。 
 
Passage 31 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章是典型驳论结构。首句是科学家共识：人类影响气候变化是最近的工业革命后才
有的。However 转折后，作者论证说：8000 年前人类农业活动就已经开始影响气候。 
 
    本句提问高亮句子是“However, evidence suggests that human agricultural activities 
may havehad such an effect much earlier”是相对于前一句“Scientific consensus is that 
humans first began to have a warming effect on Earth’s climate within the pastcentury, after 
coal-burning factories, power plants, and motor vehicles beganreleasing carbon dioxide (CO2) 
and other greenhouse gases in significant quantities into the air”而言的。虽然科学共识认
为人类对气候变暖的影响从上世纪才开始，但实际上证据表明农业活动在很久以前就有相
同的效果。所以选D。 
 
2.答案：E 
 
解析：定位到原文“concentrations ofCO2 started rising about 8000 years ago, even though 
natural trends indicate they should have been dropping”可知虽然根据natural trends CO2
的浓度应该下降，但实际上它的浓度在8000 年前开始上升。这一上升的效果是人类农业活
动造成的，所以选E。 
 
Passage 32 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：逻辑单题削弱题。文章理由是，潜水者通过喷射毒素的方式捕捉princessfish。潜水者
小心控制捕捞数量，文章结论是：潜水者的活动对于princessfish 族群没有危害。D 选项说
毒素会危害到princessfish 赖以生存的珊瑚礁，而珊瑚礁是princessfish 生存的生态系统，那
么潜水者的捕捞活动对于princessfish 就有可能产生有害影响，从而破坏结论。 
 
Passage 33 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：文章的首段通过和现代艺术理论的对比，突出文艺复兴时期建筑特色：艺术风格不拘
泥于建材本身的性质，并用Etruscans 和Florentine Renaissance builders 对Tuscanstone 的
运用做了对比：用来表达宏大主题的材料，文艺复兴建筑师用来表达精致优雅风格。第二段，
前半段延续首段，通过另一案例，Baroque architects 和Renaissance architecture 对travertine 
marble 的运用的对比，说明同样材料用于不同风格。后半段介绍不同艺术种类之间风格的
一致性，探究文艺复兴建筑风格的解释。 


 
 
 
第三段，介绍Renaissance architects 的“创造性”不仅局限于材料的使用方面。 
 
该题问文章主旨，E 选项相对最准确本文的主旨是介绍意大利建筑师对于建筑材料的态度，
对比时提到巴洛克建筑。A 选项 quality 概念偏离主题，B 选项 architecture 的概念太大，
C 选项 different cities 偏离主题，D 选项仅仅针对末段内容。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：根据painting andarchitecture of the Baroque era 定位到原文二段末：Similarly, in the 
next century, the emphasis on shading and corporeal density in Baroque painting mirrored 
the use of Roman travertine marble inBaroque architecture to create broad shadow and 
powerful masses. 该句直接表达的就是绘画和建筑风格的一致性，通过 similar 结合前句文
艺复兴时期绘画与建筑风格的一致性，可以确定D 选项。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 
解析：通过关键词定位到原文While Roman travertine marble may have lent itself to fine 
carving, the Florentine passionfor fine detail is no less marked in Florentine Renaissance 
painting than in Florentine Renaissance architecture. 可确定C 选项。B 选项有干扰性，但原
文Italian Renaissance architecture was shaped less by the “nature” of the materials at hand 
than by the artistic milieu of Renaissance Italy, which included painting and sculpture as well 
as architecture 表达的“被艺术氛围影响比被建筑材料影响更多”不能理解为“完全不受
建筑材料影响”。 
 
4. 答案：C 
 
解析：根据“scholars”定位到原文“Nor were the sepractices confined, as some scholars 
insist, to the later and supposedly decadent phases of the art Material, then, was utterly 
subservient to style”，取非，可得C 选项。 
 
Passage 34 
 
1. 答案：C   
 
解析：文章首先提出观察到的现象：C 文化B 时期的陶瓷制品有烧制后修改的痕迹。C 和W
两人提出质疑，质疑修改是针对设计错误。理由：1 很多设计错误未改。2 烧制前改正更方
便。 
 
该题问作者提到C 和W 两人的目的。C 最准确，one potential explanation 就是潜在的“修
改是针对设计错误”的解释，C 和W 质疑该解释。D 选项不准确，文章没有提出正面的原
因解释。 
 
2. 答案：A 


 
 
 
解析：A 选项根据原文：usually, intricate geometric patterns painted in black on white slipped 
surfaces…… less often, the original design was simply covered with white slip. 可知，更少设
计被白色覆盖。 
 
Passage 35 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：首段，首先介绍 Architecturalmorphology 概念，接着引入主题：建筑形态学应用到
新墨西哥教会建筑，体现本土印第安文化对传统欧洲建筑的影响。二段，首先介绍很多研究
的重点：强调气候、建筑技术等客观因素。However 转折后，作者强调文化因素的重要性。
三段，用kiva 的例子，支持二段转折后自己的观点：文化因素更重要。四段，纠正很多历史
学家的错误认识，把kiva 放在教会建筑群中间，不是历史学家理解的superposition,而是
conciliatory attitude。问题考察文章大意。体会首段和四段，可以确定选A。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：回到原文最后一段，“Freestanding kivas discovered in the ruins of European-style 
missionary communities have been explained by some historians as examples of 
“superposition” 。Under this theory, Christian domination over indigenous faiths is 
dramatized by surrounding the kiva with Christian buildings”可知选E。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：问题要求的是能够强化传教士对kiva 的态度的论述。由文中可知most Spanish 
missionaries, arriving in the Southwest with little or no military support, wisely adopted a 
somewhat conciliatory attitude toward the use of the kiva at least initially. This fact, and the 
careful, solitary placement of the kiva in the center of the mission-complex courtyards, 
suggests an intention to highlight the importance of the kiva rather than to diminish it. 让
kiva 位于教会建筑中间, 体现传教士采取了和解的态度，主要是因为传教区没有军事力量保
护。求异法对比：有军事保护，没有kiva 放在教会建筑中间。B 选项体现求异法对比思路。 
 
4. 答案：A 
 
解析：定位到原文“Certainly, the limitations imposed by manual labor and the locally 
available materials ofmud-brick and timber necessitated a divergence from the original 
European church model”说明建筑技术是导致这些教堂不同于欧式教堂的一个原因。所以
选A。 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 36 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析： 
 
文章首先引入hot Jupiters 巨行星的特殊天文现象，标准的基于solar-system 的理论认为 
hot Jupiters 不可能直接产生于靠近恒星的位置，试图将其解释为：产生于距离恒星距离远
的地方，迁移到靠近恒星的位置。一种解释为：该巨行星的引力场作用于其出身的前行星盘，
前行星盘和该行星的相互引力使其失去动力，从而旋转向恒星。另一解释认为：该巨行星的
引力场如此强大，以至于该行星在其出身的前行星盘上刻出凹槽 groove, 并把前行星盘分
割成内外分区。该巨行星和内外分区的交互作用使得其失去动力，旋转向恒星。问题：是何
力量阻止该巨行星继续旋转撞向恒星？ 
 
该题问细节目的，由关键词Earth 定位到“They are called hot Jupiters because each is similar 
in mass to Jupiter, the largest solar-system planet, but orbits its parent star at a fraction ofthe 
distance at which Earth, let alone Jupiter, orbits the Sun”可知hot Jupiters 得名于它们和木
星的质量相似，同时它们与母恒星的距离较近。提到地球主要是强调与母星的距离很近，选
B 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：问题要求选择一项两个解释中只有一种解释讨论过的要素。由两种解释区别可知选D。
C 选项another hypothesis 提到了：it creates a groove in the disk, 该disk 重复前文one 
hypothesis 中disk, 也是由dust and gas 组成的。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：根据“attempts”定位到“In the standard, solar-system-based theory of planetary 
formation, such as a massive planet could not form so close to a star. So most attempts to 
explain a hot Jupiter’s existence envision it forming farther away, then migrating inward”，
根据文章结构和后文内容可知之后解释都符合standard theory of planetary formation，所以
选E。 
 
Passage 37 
 
1. 答案：AB 
 
解析： 
 
文章是典型的转折结构。二句 but 转折前，几位二十世纪中期杰出诗人被冠以 confessional
标签。转折后，作者质疑该标签，认为这些诗人是艺术的，不是 confessional 的。 
 
    该题需要选项定位。定位到原文“The motive forconfession is penitential or 


 
 
therapeutic……But these poets always approached their writing as artists, and theirmotive was 
aesthetic”可知A 对；B 说superficially appropriate 是对的，因为作者转折后部分认可转折
前称谓：Writing from experiences like madness, despair, and lust, their aim ……；C 说是由于
absence of anyother convenient term 导致的错误，文中没有体现。 
 
2. 答案：C   
 
解析：定位到原文“But these poets always approached their writing as artists, and their 
motive was aesthetic. Writing from experiences like madness, despair, and lust, their aim was 
to makeeffective art”可知诗人的动机对于诗歌的价值是有影响的，A 错；“Writing from 
experiences like madness, despair, and lust, their aim was to make effectiveart, not to cure 
themselves”，该句是作者认为的诗人的创作意图，不能理解为B 选项：诗人在实际经验上
没有任何完成后感受到的解脱，B 错；“……to ignore theirunanimous disdain for the idea of 
confessional poetry”说明这些诗人并不希望自己的是做被标上confessional poetry 的标签，
C 对。 
 
Passage 38 
 
1. 答案：ABC 
 
解析：文章是典型的多层转折结构。文章开头介绍老观点：彗星曾经被认为是纯粹的形成外
部行星的残留物。然后说1970 年开始的新认识：紫外线放射足以使其表面不纯。Nevertheless
转折后，说，太阳的热度足以剥除彗星表面的不纯物质，意思是彗星仍然可是是纯粹的。文
章最后说，彗星本身的放射性同位素足以使其内部演化，意思是彗星更可能是不纯的。 
 
    该题需要选项定位。定位到原文“ laboratory simulations revealed there was sufficient 
ultravioletradiation reaching comets to darken their surfaces and there were sufficientcosmic 
rays to alter chemical bonds or even molecular structure near thesurface”可知选AC 选项, 
根据原文comets might contain decaying radioactive isotopes that could havewarmed 
cometary interiors to temperatures that caused the interiors to evolve 可知B 选项。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：该题需要结合题干选项定位。A 选项说，overturned by analysis of what happens when….
要求原文说的是实地研究证据，原文是laboratory simulation 实验室模拟，A 错。B 选项，
原文…… must be pristine relics of the material thatformed the outer planets 中，关于外部行
星的物质组成，并不明确是否是观察揭示的，B 错。C 选项，原文“Astronomers whostudy 
planet formation once believed that comets—because they remain mostly inthe distant Oort 
cloud, where temperatures are close to absolute zero—must bepristine relics of the material 
that formed the outer planets”是对星系外围物质的主观表述，是一种consideration,可知C
选项正确。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：C 
 


 
 
解析：最后一句提到的realization是对前面提到的观点的质疑，前面提到是Sun使得exposing 
the interior，而最后一句表明，decaying radioactive isotopes也可能会导致interiors to evolve。
C 选项正确。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：AC 
 
解析：定位到第二句，不难选出AC，本题B 选项属于无中生有。 
 
Passage 39 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：假设题。传统方法需要麻醉猴子采集血样判定DNA，确定个体猴子亲属关系，新方
法可以通过毛发判定DNA，文章结论是，就能确定个体猴子亲属关系了（新方法好使）。C
选项取非，不能确定毛发的个体猴子归属，破坏文章结论。所以选C。 
 
Passage 40 
 
1. 答案：BC 
 
解析：文章是典型的研究评论：作者认为B 的village sketches 把社区描画成单质固定的，
认为B 忽略了女性作家的village sketches. 女性作家把社区描画成动态活跃的。 
 
根据关键词village sketcheswritten by women 定位到原文“These women’s geographical 
mobility was restricted (although womenwriters of the time were not uniformly circumscribed 
in this way), and theirsubject matter reflected this fact” 和“These writers represent 
community as dynamic, as something that must benegotiated and renegotiated because of 
its members’ divergent histories,positions, expectations, and beliefs”可知选B、C 选项。 
 
2.答案：文章第一句 
 
解析：问题要求选出男性作家和女性作家描述乡村社区不同之处的句子，对应到原文首句：
“Buell’ study of village sketches(a type of fiction popular in the United States in the 1830s 
and 1840s)provides a valuable summary of sketches that portray the community 
ashomogeneous and fixed, but it ignores those by women writers, which typicallydepicted 
the diversity that increasingly characterized actual villagecommunities at that time.” 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：根据人名定位到到原文“Yet their textswere enriched by what Gilligan, writing in a 
different context, has called theability to attend to voices other than one’s own”，根据
“writing in a different context”，可知选E。 
 
 


 
 
Passage 41 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章首段首先引入主题：1820－1870 的女性小说。作者借Nina Baym 之口，给予正
评价，指出其流行性。但与社会大众相反，评论界对其是mixed 评价。Theoretical opposition 
认为其腐化堕落。Clerical opponents 认为其是道德说教上的竞争者，攻击更加猛烈。男性
作家同样也贬低女性作家。 
 
二段首先转折一段。出版商对该时期女性小说热情欢迎。少数评论者对其重视，关注到个人
作家独特价值。但On the whole, however 之后，作者认为，评论界总体上对该时期女性小
说还是偏负评价。Baym 承认女性小说主题单一，但为其辩护：认为女性作家其实并不把自
己当作艺术家，而是职业写手。对女性作家而盐，娱乐性和教育性并不矛盾。 
 
该题目问文章主旨。从文章结构分析可知选B。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：回到原文“According to Baym, the genre began with Catharine Sedgwick’s New-
England Tale (1822), manifested itself as the best-selling reading matter of theAmerican 
public in the unprecedented sales of Susan Warner’s Wide, Wide World(1850), and 
remained a dominant fictional type until after 1870”作者提到Wide, Wide World 主要想以
此为例证明女性小说非常受欢迎，所以选D。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：拿clergy 定位到第一段的倒数第二句话。并且和最后一句话的开头similarly 形成类比
关系。男性小说家和clergu 反对女性作者的理由都是一致的，都认为自己的功能受到女性
取代的威胁，由此可知答案。 
 
4. 答案：B 
 
解析：回到原文“Some fewreviewers wrote about these works with attention and respect, 
distinguishing between the works of the different authors and identifying individual strengths 
and weaknesses”说明只有很少数的reviewers 才能区分不同的作家，大多数reviewers 是不
能很好地区分这些女作家的，选B。 
 
Passage 42 
 
1. 答案：AC 
 
解析：文章关于对Cuban-American 作家的评论。Carolina Hospital 认为用英语写作的古巴
裔作家不应该被忽略。另一评论者注意到：英语载体和西班牙语载体同样重要，但强调重点
不同。 


 
 
 
    该题需要选项定位。回到原文“they represent anew phase of Cubanness, one that is 
expressed in the language comfortable toits writers--- English”可知A 正确；“Cuban-
American writers who write primarily in English are dismissed from anthologies andanalyses 
of Cuban exile literature on that account”可知B 错误；“She argues that since these writers 
were born in Cuba and consider themselves Cuban writers,they should not be ignored, and 
maintains that they represent a new phase of Cubanness, one that is expressed in the 
language comfortable to its writers---English”可知C 正确。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：词汇题。回到原文“Cuban-Americanwriters who write primarily in English……they 
represent a new phase of Cubanness, one that is expressed in thelanguage comfortable to its 
writers--- English”可知上下文要求词义为：表达流畅的，运用熟练的，选C。 
 
Passage 43 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章首先介绍地球任何地点阳光照射的变化性导致热能储存的重要性。然后，文章把
热能储存分类为两种：latentheat, sensible heat. 后文给予详细介绍（主要针对latentheat 缺
点）。该题问文章主旨，通读全文可知选B。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：选项定位。原文首句：“Constantvariations in the amount of sunlight available on Earth 
at any given locationmake energy storage a necessary design feature of terrestrial solar-
energysystems”在地球上的任意一个地方，光照量总在变化，使得储存能量成为solar-
energy systems 的一个特征。可知选A。 
 
3. 答案：AC 
 
解析：A 定位原文“but in anysubstance this storage is available only at the unique fixed 
temperature atwhich the particular phase transition occurs in that substance. ” 
 
C 定位原文“Moreover, materials that have transitions at thetemperatures that terrestrial 
solar-energy systems are likely to encounter areusually destructively corrosive at those 
temperatures”. 
 
Passage 44 
 
1. 答案：ABC 
 
解析：文章针对exotic insect pests 对森林生态系统的影响：短线影响和长线影响。之后，


 
 
文章解释为何外来物种造成长线影响的原因。 
 
选项丁文。回到原文“Short-termeffects include the disturbances directly associated with the 
action of thepest, which may cause the defoliation,loss of vigor, or death of trees. Long-term 
effects are primarily mediated bychanges in tree species composition and the consequent 
alterations of foreststructure, productivity, and nutrient uptake”可知选A、B、C。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：定位到原文“Shifts in forest species composition ramify through the ecosystem in 
many ways because tree species have different, often unique properties”可知选C。 
 
Passage 45 
 
1. 答案：AB 
 
解析：本文解释teak 代替oak 成为造船木料的原因：唯一膨胀率相同的木料，抵制腐蚀和
虫害，适合大规模运输。 
 
    题目问的是teak 相比mahogany 的优点，回到原文“Only teak matchesoak’s 
expansion coefficient and stays watertight. It is unmatched in itsresistance to rot and pests…..
可知选A、B。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：回到原文“as British oaksupplies grew scarce, shipbuilders there turned to teak and 
found in it anideal substitute”可知上下文要求的义项是：求助于，寻求。选B。 
 
Passage 46 
 
答案：B 
 
解析： 
 
原文结论“it cannot beconcluded that virtually the only biologists interested in research that 
suchexperiments could address are those biologists already employed by the spaceprogram”
是双重否定句，正面理解是：政府太空实验项目已经雇用的生物学家之外应该还有其他生物
学家对太空实验项目感兴趣。空格要求支持该结论。根据文章理由，区分理解三个概念范畴：
1 生物学家，2 大学生物学家，3 政府太空实验项目已经雇用的生物学家。画维恩图可知，
选项B 最支持结论。 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 47 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析： 
 
文章首先介绍传统历史学家对特定对象（日本1880－1930 的纺织工业）的研究方法：分开
研究。However 转折后，Hunter 倡导新的研究方法：关注共性，当作整体研究。 
 
该题定位题干中的关键词historians’ traditional analysis，回到原文“Because the branches 
were highly diverse—in scale, skill requirements, and technology—historians traditionally 
have analyzed them separately”可知选E。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：定位题干中的关键词historians’ traditional analysis，However 之后,是Hunter 对其
反驳：the workforces of all three were drawn primarily from the same population: young, 
mostly rural women aged 10 to 25. Noting this commonality, Hunter argues that a 
consideration of the three branches of production together is long overdue: examining 
elements common to the different branches of textile production may, she asserts, permit the 
identification of gender-based factors that may have influenced the operation of the 
Japanese female labor market as awhole”可知选A。 
 
B 选项是historians’traditional analysis 分开研究的原因，但不是Hunter 的反驳点。 
 
Passage 48 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：文章是典型的现象解释结构。首先引入特殊现象：生物学家发现居住在海底、不依赖
太阳光源的虾的繁殖有季节性规律。可能性解释：和它们的后代繁殖有关，因为后代迁移的
时候需要食物，而作为食物的海藻的供给量是有季节性的。 
 
    本题问高亮句作用。从文章结构分析可知，高亮句提供研究证据：研究者发现为后代提
供食物的物种并没有季节性繁殖的现象，并且居住在有非季节性开花的海藻的区域的物种
也没有季节性繁殖的特征。也就是说如果海藻有季节性，繁殖也有季节性，海藻没季节性，
繁殖也没季节性，所以很显然，作者研究者用的是求异法思路，从反面论证了前文结论的正
确性。选E。 
 
Passage 49 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：定位句在文章第一段第二句。提到两个外部机制，插入语部分的为第二个。只有一个


 
 
有第三句论据支持解释。由此得到A。 
 
2.答案：C 
 
解析：C 选项能定位到原文“Evidence from thepast clearly indicates that cycles of elevated 
landslide activity have beenfollowed by cycles of low activity, and that these are correlated 
with climatefluctuations over a variety of timescales”，其中，lowactivity = decrease。 
 
3. 答案：AC 
 
解析：A 选项定位到原文“What sets currentchanges in landslide activity apart is the likely 
influence of anthropogenic[i.e., human-caused] factors, either acting alone or in concert with 
climate, which can further modify the process of landslidingand the nature of ecosystem 
responses”。C 选项定位到原文二段首句：What sets currentchanges in landslide activity 
apart is the likely influence of anthropogenic[i.e., human-caused] factors. 
 
Passage 50 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章开头是一个对比转折：extinctions ofindigenous species caused by the introduction 
of non-indigenous predators andpathogens，由非本地捕食者或病原体引起的本地动物灭绝
很多，但是surprisingly few extinctions of indigenous species can be attributed tocompetition 
from introduced species，即物种竞争引起的灭绝其实是很少的。作者然后北美的证据。但
是，作者认为，从该证据可能得出两种替代性解释。 
 
该题问文章主旨，从文章结构分析可知A 选项最准确。 
 
B 选项，conflicting data 没有提到。 
 
C 选项，resolving a debate 原文没有。 
 
D 选项，comparing two theories 原文没有 
 
E 选项，refuting a proposedexplanation 不准确。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：问题考察作者举北美非本地植物例子的作用。根据文章结构，该例子为上位句服务：
However, surprisingly few extinctions of indigenous species can beattributed to competition 
from introduced species.可知选E。 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 51 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章作者围绕对于the literary personality 的观点，介绍不同学派的学者对其看法，并
表明自己的态度。多种当代批评流派重视。解构主义（Deconstructionists）轻视，认为 
intertextuality, subtext,metatexts 更重要。新历史主义者（New historicists）也轻视，认为作
家生活年代的思想潮流更重要。However 转折后是作者立场，作者认为，literary personality 
有其关键价值。 
 
    该题考察文章主旨，由文章结构分析可知A 最合适。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：问题要求选择new historicists 和deconstructionists 观点的共同之处，回到原文
Deconstructionists view the literary personality, like the writer’s biographical personality, as 
irrelevant……New historicists also devalue the literary personality 可知二者都否认literary 
personality 的价值，所以选B。 
 
A 选项是新历史主义观点，解构主义没有提到。 
 
C 选项是解构主义观点，新历史主义没有提到。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：词义理解题。根据上下文：New historicists also devalue the literary personality, since, 
in their emphasis on a work’s historical contexts, they credit a writer with only those insights 
and ideas that were generally available when the writer lived. 知其对应 devalue, 是devalue
反义词，选项 B 最准确。 
 
Passage 52 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章通过一个实际问题的解决介绍 WS 的研究。WS 被邀请解决一个大学讲堂的回声
问题。WS 发现了回声问题的原因，成功解决了问题，并且形成数学公式。 
 
该题问细节功能，根据关键词定位到原文“a university lecture hall in which the echo of a 
speaker’s wordsrendered them unintelligible”和“By hanging panels of sound-absorbing 
felt on the walls, Sabine reducedthe echo enough to make the hall usable”可知C 选项最准
确。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 


 
 
解析：该题目需要概括WS 的工作，结合文章结构分析可知D 最准确。 
 
Passage 53 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：文章针对8 个现存悲剧的作者确认问题。首段介绍一些现代学者的观点：作者应该是
Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger。从年代相关的证据上，LuciusAnnaeus Seneca the 
Younger 符合要求。二段针对首段作者确认的疑问：Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger 本
人为何没有提及这些作品？作者介绍了两个可能解释之一：Lucius Annaeus Seneca the 
Younger 的谨慎态度。But 转折后，作者提出自己的质疑：LuciusAnnaeus Seneca the Younger
作为皇帝的辅导老师，不应该谨慎呀！LuciusAnnaeus Seneca the Younger 不应该是这些悲
剧的作者。根据关键词定位到原文“…and the plays must have been written by 96C.C., when 
Quintilian quotesMedea, one of the tragedies”, Medea被别人Q引用，自然应该现有Medea.
可知E 选项，该时间是悲剧被创作的最晚可能时间。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：该题需要选项定位。E 选项可定位到原文二段首句：“It is remarkably,however, that 
Seneca himself never mentions the plays, since there are certainly passages in them thatcould 
be used to illustrate points of his philosophy”。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：根据文章结构定位到原文二段末：“But if anyone could safely attach his name to 
dramas, surely it would be Seneca, the emperor’s tutor. And although Herrmann offers 
Seneca’s modesty asan explanation, Seneca is not averse to referring to his other writings. 
The evidence for equating Seneca with the author of the tragedies seems circumstantial.”，
由作者因为Seneca 没有在其他作品中提到这些plays 而对Seneca 是不是真正的作者感到
怀疑，可知B 选项，作者认为，如果Seneca 真是作者，他应该提到这些悲剧作品。 
 
4.    答案：C 
 
解析：题目问作者就Seneca 作为皇帝导师的身份暗示了什么。定位到该二句：In the early 
Roman Empire, playwrights were sometimes exiled or executed forline constructed as 
directed against the emperor; thus, Seneca’s silence may besimple prudence. But if anyone 
could safely attach his name to dramas, surelyit would be Seneca, the emperor’s tutor. 前
句说当时剧作家有时因剧本内容受到迫害，以之解释Seneca 的不署名。但后句说：如果有
什么人是安全的，当然首先是Seneca, 皇帝的导师。作者否定用“担心受到迫害”来解释
Seneca 的不署名，暗示说，因为皇帝导师的什么，Seneca 是安全的。 
 
5.    答案：D 
 
解析：排除题。以下断言都是与文章中Seneca 作为戏剧作者的身份一致的，除了： 


 
 
 
D 选项原文没有依据。原文二段首句：there are certain passages in them that could be used 
to illustrate points of hisphilosophy. 能够被用来阐明作者的哲学观点，不同于D 选项：Seneca
戏剧中确定有提到作者哲学作品的内容。 
 
其他选项，A 选项，原文首段二句：Since nobody of that name is known。 
 
B 选项，原文二段：Inthe early Roman Empire, playwrights were sometimes exiled or executed 
for line constructed as directed against the emperor。 
 
C 选项，原文首段：internal references to earlier poets, most notably Ovid。 
 
E 选项，原文首段：the plays must have been written by 96 C.E., when Quintilian quotes Medea, 
one ofthe tragedies。 
 
Passage 54 
 
1. 答案：BC 
 
解析：文章围绕地球深处新发现（独立于太阳光，只依赖液态水的生命）展开，说明对于太
空生命探索的意义。作者用Europa 举例，说其地下可能存在液态水，从而有可能存在独立
于阳光的生命。 
 
    题目针对Europa 存在生命的条件，定位原文“As Europa orbitsits planet, however, it 
flexes due to the gravitational tug-of-war between it,its sister moons, and Jupiter. Through 
friction, this flexing produces heat inthe moon’s interior capable of melting ice”可知选项
B、C。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：该题问高亮句子功能，由文章结构分析可知B 选项最准确。Europa 例子主要用来推
测。A 选项不准确，后文没有说对Europa 的猜测能够被核实。 
 
Passage 55 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章首先介绍一些历史学家对于以McCormick 为主倡导的“party period paradigm”
的质疑。Voss-Hubbard 主要引用第三党的存在作为证据。Formisano 主要强调该时期
nonpartisan and anti-partygovernance 的证据。Yet 转折后，作者为McCormick 进行了辩
护：作者认为“party period paradigm”仍然是合理的观点。 
 
根据文章结构分析，可知D 选项最准确。A 选项“common”概念不准确。C 选项，challenge 
the validityof evidence 不准确。 


 
 
 
2. 解析：问题要求选择体现一位历史学家对于质疑的反应，由文章结构分析，可知原文该
句“Yet McCormick would deny that the existence of antiparty sentimentduring the period 
undermined the paradigm, since he has always acknowledged theresidual strength of such 
sentiment during the nineteenth century.”最体现此功能。 
 
3. 答案：A 
 
解析：词义理解。定位原文“that politicalparties—especially the two major parties—in the 
United States between the years1835 and 1900 evoked extraordinary loyalty from voters and 
dominated political life.”，根据上下文句义要求，可知A 最准确：“引起，诱发”某种情感
态度。 
 
Passage 56 
 
1. 答案：BC 
 
解析：文章首先介绍地面植物对于土壤结构（soilcomposition）的重要影响，以其作为理由
说明外来植物物种的入侵对于土壤结构的影响。 
 
    题目问植物为土壤提供资源的方式，根据关键词定位到原文二句：“Plantsprovide 
organic matter for soil communities through the decomposition of leaflitter, by oozing 
nutrients from roots, or through other methods of depositionof organic compounds into the 
soil environments”。可知选择BC 选项。A 选项原文没有提及。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：该题需要选项定位。答案AB 在原文中找不到依据。根据原文“As a result of these 
diverse methods by which plants supplyresources, unique soil communities form under 
different plant species and underplant communities that differ in composition”可知C 正确。 
 
Passage 57 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章针对新研究成果之前观点的关系展开。 
 
开头介绍的是被新研究成果核实的老观点：1 物种丰富性和海拔负相关。2 本地物种和地理
因素（海岛分隔）相关。3 基因区分演化（genetic differentiation）受物种所在生态环境影
响。However 转折后是被新证据推翻的老观点，新证据表明：1 一些本地物种能象外来物种
一样适应利用不规则生态栖息地（disturbedhabitat） 2 所有物种（本地／外地）基因变化
程度都高  3 （本地／外地）都能在小区域延续独立种系（independentlineages）4 本地物
种分化对物种丰富性贡献大。 
 


 
 
该题目针对文章主旨从全文整体结构分析可知选D 选项最合适。 
 
A 选项, a new theory 文章无。 
 
B 选项，文章没有 debates. 
 
C 选项，文章没有讨论证据是否具有相关性（relevance）。 
 
E 选项，文章没有说菲律宾果蝇 atypical。 
 
2.  答案：D 
 
根据文章结构，注意到高亮句genetic differentiation has been influenced by the ecology of 
the species and the current and past geographic and geological conditions 前有一个重要的
表示并列的逻辑信号词“and”，可知高亮句和前半句一起服务于首句提出的观点。所以，
该题答案选D。 
 
3. 答案：A 
 
解析：该题需要根据文章结构比较选项。 
 
B 答案错误，原文中并没有出现atypical 的描述；C 不准确，原文中并没有提到研究者之间
的争论；D 错误，因为far more previous hypotheses have been overturned than supported；
E 错误，vulnerable 概念原文没有。A 选项最准确，因为文章重点在于转折后：far moreprevious 
hypotheses have been overturned than supported。 
 
Passage 58 
 
1. 答案：第二句 
 
解析：文章是对最近研究趋势（关于选举政治中的性别差异）的解释：因为几个研究的发现
表明选举行为的性别差异不再显著。However 转折后说，F & S 认为，南方的性别差异仍然
显著。 
 
      该题要求找针对特定趋势的原因，根据文章结构可以定位到二句：This shift in 
focusfrom gender inequality in political participation may be due to the finding inseveral 
studies of voting behavior in the United States that since 1980…….。“due to”部分就是原
因解释。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：该题需要选项定位。 
 
E 选项可以定位到原文Recent studies ofthe gender gap in the history of United States policies 


 
 
tend to focus oncandidate choice rather than on registration and turnout. 其中，the 
frequency with which they vote 对应原文：registrationand turnout。此题容易错选D 选项，
注意voter preference 指的其实就是candidate choice，这个题没有说不同地区的candidate 
choice 的差异，而是说的男女投票人的报名和出席的差异。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：B 
 
解析：信息目的题，考查句间句内关系。本文提到several studies 是作为一个原因提出的，
may be due to…,用来解释shift in focus from…，本题选B。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：B 
 
解析：主旨题考查文章结构：文章开头提出最近的研究倾向于candidate choice rather than 
a registration and turnout。然而，在后文中指出这种做法overlooked the substantial gender 
gap in registration and voting in the South。B 选项符合文章结构。 
 
Passage 59 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章围绕最近的关于古玛雅水管理的研究发现展开。水利用设施的发现被认为有利于
中央集权的管理制度。文章末句，作者指出，该观点不适合于水资源丰富的地区（尽管对于
缺乏水资源的地区有道理） 
 
该题需要理解选项与文章结构的匹配程度。 
 
A 选项，a widely dcatered population 文章没有。 
 
B 选项，原文没有强调前提必要性：pretext。 
 
C 选项，原文没有提到 challenges。 
 
E 选项,  原文没有提到 continued maintenance。 
 
D 选项最合适地概括了文章结构。 
 
2. 答案：ABC 
 
解析：定位到原文In the central and southern Maya Lowlands, this kind of water control was 
necessary to support large populations throughout the year due to the scarcity of perennial 
surface water and the seasonal availability of rainfall 可知AC 正确。pattern of rainfall 对应于
seasonal availabilityof rainfall，insufficient resources such as ponds, rivers and lakes 对应于
scarcity of perennial surface water。 
 


 
 
B 选项对应首句：Recent studies ofancient Maya water management have found that the 
urban architecture of some cities was used to divert rainfall runoff into gravity-fed systems of 
interconnected reservoirs. 
 
Passage 60 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：文章围绕Ralph Ellison 对于视觉艺术的态度。Yet 转折前介绍他的认可态度，转折后
重点强调他的负面态度：勉强接受两个对于Invisible Man  插图版的出版，持续拒绝电影版
的改编，坚持认为只有语言才能表达美国身份的复杂性，认为该复杂性来自美国建国文件和
当代经验的冲突。 
 
       该题针对文章细节，根据关键词Ellision’s apprenticeship 定位到原文Ralph Ellison 
was passionately interested in visual arts……even apprenticing with sculptor Richmond Barthe 
for a time. Yet hewas wary of projects aiming to provide a visual rendering of his novelInvisible 
Man。结合文章结构，可知举这个例子是为后文他拒绝视觉艺术作出让步，他对视觉艺术不
是完全负面态度。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：根据关键词tension 定位到原文This complexity consisted of the tension arising from 
the collision of the United States’ written ideals, as outlined in the founding documents, and 
the historical and contemporary experience molding the national consciousness，结合前句：
Ellison insisted that only language could capture the complexity of American identity，可知
Ellison 相信文字能比visual art 更好的描述该矛盾，所以选C。 
 
Passage 61 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析： 
 
文章对比了陆地农业和海洋渔业两种食物获得方式，并重点强调了海洋渔业的问题：与陆地
农业不同，海洋渔业难于同时实现两个目的：增加食物产量和保护生态系统丰富性。 
 
该题针对文章主旨，通过结构分析可知B 选项最合适。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：定位到原文produce greater yields from less land,thereby freeing land for conservation 
purposes，结合和海洋渔业的对比，可知E 选项。 
 
 


 
 
Passage 62 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析： 
 
通读全文可知文章新发现否定老观点结构。老观点：increasing-disadvantagemodel/ceiling 
metaphor for women.  相关新证据：1 私人领域,流动机会随职位升高而增加,2 公共领域，
无性别差异或低级别更多不利, 3 国际研究中，多数相反证据。 
 
该题针对文章主旨，可知B 最合适。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：limited evidence 的原句是“women’s probability of being located in a higher versus 
a lower hierarchical level declined relative to men’s at higher levels.”，这个说法就是女性
在高地位的概率降低，这也就是increasing-disadvantage model 的同义改写，所以A 选项
符合。注意这个题不是在问limited evidence 这句话的功能，而是在问limited evidence 本身
的内容。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：题目问文章作者与老观点的共同之处。老观点（increasing-disadvantagemodel）认为
女性随职位升高面对更多因素。作者引用新研究反对老观点，在文章最后又清楚表明自己立
场：Women’s scarcity in top organizational ranks may simply represent the cumulative 
effectof a constant-or even decreasing-disadvantage at successive hierarchical levels。可见，
虽然作者和老观点就不利因素是否随职位提高而增加有分歧，但都同意：妇女面对不利歧视
因素。所以选E。 
 
Passage 63 
 
答案：B 
 
解析：文章是研究介绍加评论结构。George Orwell 研究商业文本，认为其抑制普通民众的
本能社会主义倾向，公众的激进本能（社会主义倾向）会被商业文本中convert patrician 
conservatism 所蒙蔽。作者GeorgeOrwell 的这些研究高评价，但认为有早于George Orwell 
的对流行商业文化的严肃研究。 
 
该题需要选项定位。B 选项可以定位到原文GeorgeOrwell examined commercial texts ……The 
public, heconcluded, was often being duped by a convert patrician conservatism, 
conveyedthrough commercial culture。 
 
A 选项无依据。在文章中， ordinarypeople 是商业文本的作用对象。 
 


 
 
C 选项与原文相反。 
 
D 选项与作者评论相反。 
 
E 选项原文无依据。 
 
Passage 64 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章是关于Charlotte Bronte 的几个传记评论的介绍及评论，主要按照时间顺序介绍
评论。文章作者认为：Elizabeth Gaskell 的评论强调CB 作品受工业化时代环境影响小，体
现乡村文化，强调CB 思想观点的正确性。Matthew Arnold 关注CB 作品中隐藏的颠覆性、
破坏性思想。Winifred Gerin 还是受到ElizabethGaskell 的影响。女权主义者引入对CB 的新
解释，但只有JulietBarker 考虑到周围变化的世界对CB 的影响。 
 
       该题考察文章主旨，根据文章时间线索结构可知选C。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：根据人名定位到原文：this was at variance with the subversive spirit Matthew Arnold 
accurately discerned, albeit with distance, deep within Bronte’s fiction 可知Matthew Arnold
认为Bronte 的小说包含颠覆性的精神，是危险的，所以选B。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：根据人名定位原文：Elizabeth Gaskell promoted the long-persisting romantic view of 
Bronte as having no connection with the rest of English society at a time when industrialization 
was causing much turbulence, but as having sprungnaturally……out of the English countryside
表明Gaskell 认为Charlotte Bronte 深受乡村自然环境影响，所以选E。 
 
Passage 65 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章第一段说Seligia 石棉在建筑业有着广泛的应用。但由于这种材料会导致某种癌
症，石棉将会被禁止。第一个高亮句是作者预测，也是作者核心结论：the ban will result in 
reducing the incidence of that type of cancerin Seligia by as much as 50 percent。 
 
第二个黑体句（第二段开头）是作者让步承认的与核心结论矛盾的信息：less than 30percent 
of the death certificates of Seligians who have died of that cancerhave “construction” listed 
asthe deceased’s occupation。作者之后补充辩论说，因为从事建筑业的人老了后会改行，
而通常死亡证明上又只会记录最后的一个职业。所以第二个高亮句需要后文补充，如果没有
补充信息，就会质疑核心结论。A 选项是对两句黑体句在全文中功能的最准确概括。 


 
 
 
Passage 66 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章首先指出矛盾现象：学者关注到19 世纪早期的作家群体，但对该时期的文学评
论研究很不充分。之后是作者对该矛盾（文学评论研究不充分）的解释：行业壁垒，缺乏批
评理论训练，研究既不够集中，又不够具有大局观。 
 
该题根据关键词 literary scholars, historians 定位到原文historians study people across the 
nation, but much literary scholarship called “American”actually examines works produced 
in northeastern states，可知B 选项正确。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：定位到原文对矛盾的解释：Few historians have extensive training in critical theory and 
its specialized languages, ……. And historians usually study the operations ofcapitalism in its 
details, while literary critics produce a generalized picture of literary commodification. 可知
文学批评的独特的性质是阻碍历史学家的研究的原因，所以选D 选项。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：AB 
 
解析：A 选项正确，对应第三句，文中提到：很少有历史学家接受过批判性理论及其专门语
言的广泛训练，而美国早期历史和文学作品的数量之大，对任何一个想要精通这两个领域的
人都是一种挑战，更不用说同时精通这两个领域了。 
 
B 选项正确，与第二题重合。 
 
C 选项无中生有。 
 
Passage 67 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：文章针对一个文学现象（Samuel Johnson 拒绝赞助）理解的评论。However 转折后，
作者反驳旧理解观点（a key moment in thehistory of publishing）,认为该事件不重要，仅仅
是一个情感表达。 
 
       该题要求根据文章上下文理解题干关键词的作用。Johnson’s 1762 pension award
其实支持了作者的观点：该拒绝事件没有那么重要，他之后仍然接受了类似的赞助。E 选项
最准确。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 


 
 
解析：该题考察高亮句作用。根据文章结构，可知该句用来支持作者核心观点，否定老观点
解释。C 选项最准确表述了高亮句和老观点的关系。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：AB 
 
解析：本题与第一题考点重合，选AB。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：C 
 
解析：根据原文patronage had been in decline…，可推知C 选项正确。AB 选项在原文中均
无对应依据。 
 
Passage 68 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章首先描述矛盾现象：更多来自欧亚大陆的适应寒冷动物迁徙到非洲，更少来自非
洲的适应炎热气候动物迁徙到欧亚大陆。作者从大陆桥和大陆桥两边的适宜栖息地角度解
释。气候寒冷期，大陆桥存在时间更长，适合适应寒冷气候动物迁徙到非洲。相反，气候温
暖期，只有短暂的海水上升滞后期大陆桥才存在，适应炎热气候动物有更少机会迁徙到欧亚
大陆。 
 
       该题根据关键词ice age 定位到原文Duringperiods of climatic cooling, such as the 
various ice ages, the land bridge isopen for a long time (because sea level remains low) and 
is usable bycold-adapt species because cool habitats then extend across it，结合前文可知选
A。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：根据关键词short lag 定位原文intercontinentalmigrations require both a land bridge 
connecting the two continents and thesuitable habitat both on and across that land bridge，
可知选D。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：题干所指the apparent bias inantelope-migration direction 即指文章矛盾现象。综合
后文解释中的比较，可知E 选项：寒冷时期（适应向热带迁徙）比温暖时期（适应向寒冷地
区迁徙）路桥更容易存在。 
 
Passage 69 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章围绕Colin Calloway 和Bernard Bailyn 两人对同一现象（美国革命前英国政府对


 
 
于阿巴拉契亚山脉以西土地的封存）的不同解释以对比的形式展开。Colin Calloway 认为是
英国政府预防贪婪的白人殖民者掠夺印地安人土地。 
 
Bernard Bailyn 认为英国政府是出于垄断贸易、避免战争目的而封存土地。 
 
本题针对文章主旨，可知D 选项最准确。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：通过高亮关键词定位到原文White Americans seized NativeAmerican land by any 
available means, they were continuing a tradition datingback to the earliest years of English 
settlement in North America。概括该句可知E 选项最准确。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：问题要求选择两人的共同点。E 选项针对两人同一解释对象。 
 
Passage 70 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章首段指出特殊现象：一夫一妻制灵长类动物中存在父亲对婴儿的照顾现象。
GeorgeEdwards 观察到该类现象。Kleiman 认为一夫一妻制，父亲对婴儿亲属关系的确信是
该类现象的原因。Symons 为首认为一夫一妻制在哺乳动物中相当罕见（意思是父亲对婴儿
照顾现象也很少见）。二段指出最近的发现可能颠覆老观点。Hardy 认为：1 灵长类一夫一妻
制远比之前认为的更普遍。2 父亲照料远比之前认为的更普遍。之前认为：一夫一妻制，父
亲对婴儿亲属关系的确信导致父亲照料婴儿。现在认为存在替代可能性：父亲照顾婴儿现象
有助于（pre-adapt）一夫一妻制。作者评论认为：两种情况都可能正确。父亲婴儿照料不
是局部特殊现象。父亲在婴儿照料方面发挥比之前认为更大作用。 
 
       该题可以用人名定位到二段二句。二句服务于段首主旨句：Recent findings, however, 
make it necessary to reverse this picture。可知Hrdy 的发现质疑了以前的结论，所以选C。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：该题考察作者对evolutionary relationship betweenmale care and monogamy 的总体
评价。定位到二段作者评价：Either scenariocould be true，可确定E 选项。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 
解析：根据关键词定位到原文：Whereas previously, it was assumed that monogamy and male 
certainty of paternity facilitated the evolution of male care, it now seems appropriate to 
consider the alternative possibility，其that 从句说：that the extraordinary capacity of male 
primates to look out for the fates of infants did in some way pre-adapt members of this order 


 
 
for the sort of close, long-term relationships between males and females that, under some 
ecological circumstances, leads tomonogamy. 该证据质疑了老观点，可知C 选项正确。该
新证据并没有说之前的证据有问题，B 不准确。 
 
4. 答案：B 
 
解析：根据关键词定位到上下文可知the alternative possibility 指的是theextraordinary 
capacity of male primates to look out for the fates of infantsdid in some way pre-adapt 
members of this order for the sort of close,long-term relationships between males and 
females that, under some ecological circumstances,leads to monogamy。即父亲照顾婴儿现
象有助于（pre-adapt）一夫一妻制。B 选项最能支持这一结论：父亲照顾婴儿现象早于一夫
一妻制。A 现象早于B 现象，能够为称为B 的原因提供支持。 
 
Passage 71 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章首段描述第十四条修正案痛苦的出台过程：从1866 年的民权法案，经过立法、
司法、行政几方的权力角力，第十四修正案1868 年终于获得通过。 
 
第二段介绍第十四修正案出台后，立法机关的美好理想和司法机关的丑陋实践之间的矛盾。
司法机关通过案例判定施加的影响，背离了第十四修正案种族平等的理想。 
 
第三段介绍第二次世界大战后，第十四条修正案才开始真正发挥作用。司法机关通过一些关
键案例的判定，真正落实乃至扩展了第十四修正案种族平等，反对歧视的思想。 
 
该题针对文章主旨。所以综上可知最好的答案是C 选项。 
 
A 错，所概括内容与原文矛盾：The broadlanguage of the amendment strongly suggests that 
its framers were proposing towrite into the Constitution not a laundry list of specific civil rights 
 
B 选项针对三段内容，范围过小。 
 
D 选项与文章主旨矛盾。首段即明确指出对于起草者意图的共识。 
 
E 选项针对三段，概括也不准确。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：回到关键词state action limitation 定位到原文原文第二段：In the Civil Rights Cases of 
1883, for example, the Court inventedthe “state action” limitation,which asserts that 
“private”decisions by owners of public accommodations and other commercial business 
tosegregate their facilities are insulated from the reach of the FourteenthAmendment’s 
guarantee of equal protection under the law。概括可知A 选项， the state action limitation


 
 
违背了第十四条修正案的平等原则，纵容了私人领域的种族歧视和种族隔离现象。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：根据关键词framers of the Fourteenth Amendment 定位到原文第1 段：…… all 
interpreters agree that theframers’ immediate objective was to provide a constitutional 
warrant for theCivil Rights Act of 1866, which guaranteed the citizenship of all persons bornin 
the United States and subject to United States jurisdiction. 可知作者认为起草者的意图是给
所有提供平等公民权。哪个选项把起草者提供平等公民权的范围理解得最小，哪个正确。A
选项说，起草者预计到后文提到的state action limitation, 只保护公共领域的平等权利，B 选
项说framers had merely sought to preventdiscriminatory acts by federal officials，只针对联
邦政府官员的歧视行为。B 选项所指范围明显小于A 选项。B 破坏力最强。 
 
4. 答案：B 
 
解析：此题明显定位到第一段，第一段说这些proponents 支持这个Act，然后他们为了让
Act 有宪法foundation，所以要去推动十四修订案，所以终极目标是去推动Act，而Act 的
宗旨就是这些人想要实现的目标：确保公民的平等权利。所以最合适的答案是B 选项 
 
5. 答案：A 
 
解析：虚拟取非题。问题问的是在什么情况下第十四条修正案可能不会被颁布，回到首段第
十四修正案出台的关键因素：The act was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, who argued 
that theThirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, did not provide Congress withthe 
authority to extend citizenship and equal protection to the freed slaves. 可知是由于总统质
疑Congress，使得Congress 推翻了他的的反对才使得这条修正案通过的。将该关键因素取
非，可知，如果Congress 没有受到质疑，这条修正案也不会被通过了。A 选项。 
 
6. 答案：D 
 
解析：由the Civil Rights Act of 1866……was designed primarily to counter the Supreme 
Court’s ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford 可知Ⅱ在Ⅰ前；由Congresspromptly overrode 
Johnson’s veto, supporters of the actsought to ensure its constitutional foundations with 
the passage of theFourteenth Amendment 可知Ⅳ 在Ⅲ前。又由于Fourteenth Amendment
在1868 年通过，所以总的顺序是Ⅱ Ⅰ Ⅳ Ⅲ，选D。 
 
7. 答案：E 
 
解析：根据关键词the second of the two doctrines 定位到原文Second, the Court relaxed 
the state action limitation on theFourteenth Amendment, bringing new forms of private 
conduct within theamendment’s reach。第二条doctrine 放松了state action limitation 对
Fourteenth Amendment 的限制，结合二段可知将使得private conduct 也将受到Fourteenth 
Amendment 的约束，所以对于commercial business 来说更难进行racialdiscrimination 了，
选E。 


 
 
 
Passage 72 
 
1.答案：B 
 
解析：文章首段首先介绍传统老观念：认为大约250 万年前的地球生物大灭绝是一个渐进
的过程，主要由气候变化引起；Yet 之后一些学者对老观点提出了挑战：PW 等通过考古证
据，认为流星撞击地球才是导致剧烈大灭绝的原因。二段展开新老观点的证据，相互的辩驳
及此消彼长。文章最后，作者引出月球证据，支持了新观点。该题针对文章主旨目的，通过
文章结构可知选B。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：题干观点是二段老观点，定位到二段原文对老观点的质疑：The problem withascribing 
all tillites to glaciation, however, is that tillite deposits arewidespread in Precambrian 
sediments，结合后句，当时气候温暖，不应该产生如此多的tillites, 由此推出有其他来源产
生tillites。可知C 选项是质疑老观点、支持新观点的关键。 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：文中说Rampino and others question one of thetraditionalists’ basic assumption: the 
periodicoccurrence of glaciation throughout Earth’s history. 传统观念学者认为terrestrial 
tillites 是由于冰川活动引起的，而Rampino 则认为是meteor impacts 引起的。月球上的
certain Moon rocks 肯定是由于meteor impacts 引起的，如果能够证明terrestrial tillites 和
certain Moon rocks 的相似性，就就支持Rampino 的观点：terrestrial tillites 也是由meteor 
impacts 导致的，也就驳斥了传统学者的观点：terrestrial tillites 是冰川引起的。D 选项正确。 
 
4. 答案：B 
 
解析：回到原文Supporters of the traditionalist view notethat species begin disappearing 
from the fossil record well before the end ofthe Permian period. Yet, while such a pattern 
could have resulted from a slowlyrising extinction rate, some scientistsargue that just because 
a species disappears from the fossil record doesn’t necessarily mean it became extinct at 
that point。可以说明双方就某种生物从化石记录中消失所代表的意义存在争论：老观点认
为化石消失代表灭绝，新观点（some scientists）认为消失未必代表灭绝。B 选项最准确概括
双方分歧。 
 
Passage 73 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章首段针对矛盾现象（Jane Austen 生活在浪漫主义时代，但被认为脱离于主流浪
漫主义男性诗人）展开老观点：Jane Austen 脱离于主流浪漫主义男性诗人，即使女权主义
批评兴起之后。 


 
 
 
二段介绍相反观点：Jane Austen 和浪漫主义男性诗人是有密切关系的。 
 
三段介绍特殊案例：the present essay，从特定角度支持二段观点。 
 
由文章结构，尤其二段三段关系，可知C 选项最准确。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：题目要求确认首段首句主旨句的主要支持理由。C 选项针对二句主要理由：Although 
her dates (1775-1817) place her squarely within the period,she traditionally has been studied 
apart from the male poets whose work definedBritish Romanticism for most of the twentieth 
century。 
 
3. 答案：A 
 
解析：题目针对首段“historicist and feminist criticism”和之前观点的区别，定位到原文
which challenged many previous characterizations of Austen as detached from the 
majorsocial, political and aesthetic currents of her time, she continued to be ……可知A 选项。 
 
4. 答案：B 
 
解析：定位到原文she continued to be distinguished from hermale contemporaries……for 
example……Anne Mellor declares that Austen, along with other “leading women intellectuals 
and writers of the day” “did not”, participate in the Romantic “spirit of the age” but 
instead embraced an alternative ideology that Mellor labels “feminine Romanticism”可知 
包括末句在内的历史主义和女权主义批评没有化解，而是加重了首段首句描述的矛盾现象。
B 选项最准确。 
 
Passage 74 
 
答案：B 
 
解析：文章理由说trucks 对公路的破坏取决于单 axle 承重量的提升，新规定增加了允许卡
车载重的总量。结论说新规定会允许能对公路造成更加严重的破坏卡车上路。从理由到结论
的推理中忽略了相关重要因素，因为：破坏力（单轴承重量）＝总重量／轴数。B 选项最准
确描述逻辑漏洞。 
 
Passage 75 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：文章理由提到，EP 自然条件下生长需要火，火创造两个关键条件：1 一氧化氮使其
发芽，2 清除灌木，使其能见阳光。人工条件提供了自然关键条件1. E 选项是正确推理，不


 
 
满足第2 个条件，该植物无法长期存活。 
 
Passage 76 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：文章首先指出一个现象：全球海平面相对陆地上升，解释原因是：南北极夏季融化雪
多于冬季形成雪。紧接着说this hypothesis is not undermined by observation: 斯堪的纳维
亚的海平面相对陆地下降(首句黑体)，之后是针对该矛盾的解释原因。分析段落结构可知C
选项。 
 
Passage 77 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章首先指出现象：编辑们因为国际新闻页面的减少而被批评。编辑关键是：读者应
该为减少担负全责，因为读者对于国际新闻的兴趣减少导致相关报道销量减少（首句黑体）；
但是作者认为：编辑仍然应当承担部分责任，理由是：编辑可以通过提高报道频率的方式来
增加读者的兴趣。由结构分析可知，第一个高亮句是支持编辑的理由，编辑的立场是作者反
对的立场；第二个高亮句是作者支持自己立场的理由，也是批评编辑辩解的理由。A 选项最
准确。 
 
Passage 78 
 
答案：B 
 
解析：文章背景信息是：B 在冬天将时间拨慢一个小时。文章理由是：冬令时调整不会增加
黑暗中的驾驶数量（时间），文章的核心观点是：冬令时调整不会影响车祸概率。整理清楚
文章结构后，主动考虑破坏结论的因素。如果因为早上和晚上微妙的差异，导致时间调整后
早上事故率的降低大于晚上事故率的下降，那么作者的结论就会被破坏。文章推理要成立，
必须假设结论被破坏的可能性不存在。B 选项否定了早上和晚上的差异。 
 
Passage 79 
 
1. 答案：A B 
 
解析：文章首句介绍特殊EB 作品的特殊现象：作品质量高导致大家容易忽略其低产量。二
句but 转折后说EB 本人对此很在意抱歉。之后是作者的评论：作品数量低促成后代对她的
特殊高评价，但也是导致她与当时文学界疏远关系的原因。A 选项定位到末句：Yet the size 
ofher work is also a sign of Bishop’s alienation, that is, her uneasy, resistantrelation to the 
literary culture that today claims her as the major poet of hergeneration. B 选项定位到原文
The small,manageable size of Bishop’s body of work hasfacilitated its extraordinary critical 
reception since her death。 
 


 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：定位到原文上下文：But the size and pace of her outputwere always in her own eyes 
a failing (vaguely moral in complexion) for which she apologized throughout her career. 短
语“vaguely moral in complexion”是对主句的解释，从主句 in herown eyes 可知
complexion 和“视觉”有关，A 选项appearance 最合适。短语“vaguelymoral in complexion”
理解为：看起来有微弱的道德意味。 
 
Passage 80 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：假设题。背景：Shoreland County 买下了一块荒地防止其被开发，为此，Shoreland 
County 放弃了这块地上未来的财产税。理由：财产税基于市场价值，如果进行开发会带来
巨额的税收。结论：由于这次收购拒绝开发，Shoreland County 的税收总收入会比开发少很
多。注意到理由结论之间的概念变化：理由中overall annual tax 考虑的是待开发land 本身，
结论中overall annual tax 潜在来源需要考虑的是整个县，不仅要考虑待开发land 本身，还
要考虑待开发land 周围地区。D 选项弥补了理由结论间的潜在概念漏洞。 
 
Passage 81 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：文章首先描述现象：内战后，很多前奴隶成为sharecroppers 或者tenant farmers. 二
句介绍主流历史学家的观点：把两个黑人改革的代表人物（RLS,JEC）看作anti-racists. 之后
是作者的评论：两人主要是务实的改革家，尽管有反种族主义的成分。文章末句总结：尽管
如何认识他们的影响有争议，他们确实作出了实际的贡献。 
 
该题针对文章主旨。通过文章结构分析可知C 选项最准确：作者的评论举证反驳了主流历
史学家的观点。文章并没体现历史学家对改革者的毁谤，所以也不存在恢复名誉，A 错；文
章没有同时代人对这两个改革者的批判，B 错；文章没有讨论改革者为什么会出名，D 错；
文中也没有详述farm tenancy system 对南方经济的影响，E 错。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：题目问作者对两位改革者的评价。文章最后一句典型体现作者对他们的评价：While 
theextent of these reformers’ influence requires morestudy, early their organizations 
provided a voice for African American farmersseeking to improve their positions in the 
agrarian South。D 选项最准确。 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 82 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：削弱题。律师辩护理由：TEB已经根据自己的规定奖励了举报人员，开除了wrongdoers。
律师辩护结论：TEB 做出足够的努力来防止欺诈政府的行为，指控是错误的。针对理由和结
论之间可能的概念跳跃，如果说Wrongdoing 的定义是危害TEB 公司自身的行为，那么即使
TEB 公司开除了Wrongdoers，也不能成为“TEB 没有做出足够的努力来防止欺诈政府的行
为”辩护的理由，因为指控所定义的过错和公司所定义的过错是不一样的，因此A 选项正
确。 
 
Passage 83 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章首句二句指出特殊事实：当代北极植物是最近65 million 年才迁移到北极的。针
对该事实的一种观点解释：这些植物起源于中亚和北美高山，随气候变冷迁移到北极地区。
However 转折后，作者指出支持前述观点的证据缺失。该题需要根据选项定位原文。B 选项
可定位到原文：theroutes by which these plants expanded their ranges during their 
colonization ofthe Arctic remain unknown。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：根据上下文：Only toward the end of that period doesthe fossil evidence show that 
certain present-day Arctic plants wereestablished and widely distributedthroughout the Arctic. 
Many Arctic plants are thought to have originated in the high mountain rangesof central Asia 
and North America, to have spreadnorthward to the Arctic…... 根据下句 originated, spread
可确定distribute 是分散、传播的意思。 
 
Passage 84 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章首先通过和德国的比较，描述挪威工业化相关的特点：历史悠久的相对平等的阶
层关系。之后分析该平等的原因。该题问文章主旨，根据文章结构分析可知D 选项最准确。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：根据关键词定位到原文：a strong aristocracy and landownerclass did not emerge in 
most of Norway. There were some exceptions to thispattern, especially in the southern 
regions where a landowner class did exist，可知A 选项。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 


 
 
解析：选项定位。C 选项可定位到最后一句：Norway’s early social and economic history 
engendered egalitarianism,although, as has been pointed out by several observers, it was an 
equality ofpoverty。 
 
Passage 85 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：文章是现象解释结构。现象：同样开始收费，Rivera Art Museum 游客下降比其他本
地博物馆更严重。原因解释：博物馆靠近政府办公楼，所以游客主体为政府工作人员。当博
物馆收费后，这些人选择不在午餐休息时间逛博物馆导致了短时参观人流减少。C 选项采取
求异法对比思路：非工作日（周末）的长时参观数量下降一样多甚至可能更多，否定了原文
针对短时参观的解释。 
 
Passage 86 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章背景信息：金星大气中二氧化硫由火山活动产生，由钙吸收。文章理由：金星当
前大气中有大量二氧化硫。文章的结论是：Venus 上现在有火山之类的产生sulfur dioxide 的
源头。A 选项取非，金星过去二氧化硫比现在显著更高，意味着现在的二氧化硫有可能是过
去遗留的，现在只有吸收，没有释放来源。 
 
Passage 87 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章针对火星北部低平表明讨论原因解释。首段和二段开头讨论解释1：类似地球的
不同地壳导致的板块移动最终导致该低地。二段however 转折后，McGill 指出早于版块移
动的地质构造，质疑版块解释说，提出新机制说。第三中解释是外部冲击。该题针对文章主
旨，根据文章结构分析可知D 选项最准确。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：根据关键词定位到原文首段：On Earth’s surface, higher- and lower-lyingareas have 
different types of crust: one, thin and dense, is pulled towardEarth’s center more strongly 
by gravity, and the planet’s water naturally comesto sit over it, creating oceans。板块动力
来自行星内部，可知选A 选项是最准确概括。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：问题考察 McGill 的理论与别人不同的地方。回到原文McGill instead believes that 
through some novel mechanism the ancient surface sank to its current depth as a single unit
可知他的理论并没有明确指出到底是什么作用导致the ancient surface sank to its current 


 
 
depth，只是模糊的说through some novel mechanism，而第一种理论说Some researchers 
do see signs of tectonic activity surrounding the northern basinthat suggest that it was 
created through the formation of new crust, like ocean basins on Earth，即假设这种作用是
引力，第三种理论说The third possibility is that the northern low lands result from impact，
假设这是陨星撞击的作用。因此选B。 
 
Passage 88 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
 解析：文章针对一种现象（CH 东部 abalone 渔业的衰败）的原因解释（过度捕捞）提出
替代性解释（Rocklobster 的引入），然后描述Rocklobster 导致abalone 下降的生态链条机
制。该题是细节题，根据时间线索和关键词seaurchins 定位到原文aninvasion by rock 
lobsters during the early 1990s …… prey on sea urchins, and increasedrock lobster densities 
coincided with significant decreases in urchins。 可知从early 1990s 开始，由于龙虾入侵，
海胆数量减少，所以选B。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：细节定位题。C 选项能定位到原文：urchinsfeed largely by trapping drift kelp, and in 
doing so provide juvenile abalonewith both protective shelter and nourishment. Without 
urchins’ presence, juvenile abalones are less likely to survive to adulthood 可知海胆对于幼
年期的abalone 的生存和成长非常重要，所以选C。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：D 
 
解析：归纳题，由原文已知信息推未知信息。由第二句when abalones did not rebound, 
commercial fishing 可知closing of the recreational fishery 没能够阻止abalone 的减少，本
题选D。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：AB 
 
解析：A 选项正确，对应第三句，an invasion…intensified the trend； 
 
B 选项正确，对应第一句。 
 
C 选项无中生有。 
 
Passage 89 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章推理是典型目的手段结构。目的：阻止偷猎象牙到达市场。手段：象牙进口国家
禁止进口象牙。文章必须假设手段能够实现目的。A 选项取非，非法渠道仍然能够到达出口


 
 
市场，严重削弱结论：如此，则手段不能实现目的。 
 
Passage 90 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章是典型现象解释结合对比结构。文章直接明确特定现象的原因：早期英国殖民地
失败（尽管资源丰富）的原因就是：定居者的思维定势使得他们不能学习当地印第安人的关
键生存技能——移动。后文对比展开欧洲人和印第安人不同的对居住的理解。 
 
该题需要选项定位。 
 
A 选项与原文信息相反。 
 
B 选项正确。原文说：…..failed amid the New World’s abundance was that thesettlers’ 
mindset prevented them from living like the native inhabitants……butthey did not adopt the 
real key to success: mobility……changing food resources.…. 
 
C 选项不能从原文得出。原文认为欧洲人学习了本地印第安人的技术：the settlers learned 
such skills as building brushwood weirs to trapfish…. 
 
2.答案：D 
 
解析：根据关键词定位到原文，结合文章结构可知D 选项。 
 
Passage 91 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：针对特定现象（怀孕老鼠没有对婴儿老鼠产生通常会产生的蛋白拒绝。解释1 是：环
绕婴儿老鼠的placenta 阻止了母亲的免疫系统。解释2 是：placenta 产生的IDO 起到关键
的阻止作用。 
 
题目要求比较两种解释的有效性。利用求异法，检测两种解释的关键区别(有无IDO ) 来检
测是否有免疫反应的关键结果。E 选项最好体现该思路。 
 
Passage 92 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：根据关键词定位到文章末句举例，知其是bad science 的isolated metaphor。 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 93 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：文章建议手段是：使用海底电缆的方法，文章结论是：该新手段能保护游泳者，保持
旅游业兴旺。如E 选项所说，作为吸引旅游者主要资源的海洋哺乳动物会因为海底电缆而被
驱逐，则该手段导致主要目的不能实现，削弱论证。 
 
Passage 94 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：关键词定位，结合文章结构可确定C 选项。 
 
Passage 95 
 
文章主线： 
 
与LindaNicholson 不同，Katherine Lynch 认为女性志愿者活动让女性联系到一起形成了一
种非正式的公民权，形成了社会的联系，有了公共生活，而不是被限制在家庭中。 
 
1.答案：B 
 
解析：信息题，问Lynch 认为这些志愿者活动是怎么样的。文章中主线是Lynch 说女性志愿
者活动让女性与社会联系，不局限于私人领域。当然也有让步说志愿者活动不能替代正式的
政治生活。 
 
A.错误，Lynch 认为志愿者活动是公共活动的一部分，但是并不能替代政治活动。并没有说
志愿者活动是政治生活的初期阶段。 
 
B.正确，Lynch 认为志愿者活动对女性的公共生活有作用，需要更多的重视，被Nicholson 之
类的人低估了。 
 
C.错误，这是和Lynch 相反的观点。 
 
D.错误，没有说过女性志愿者活动能改变政治结构。 
 
E.错误，没有说过这种活动是不是非典型的。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：信息题，问Lynch 认为正式的政治生活怎么样。文章中让步说正式的政治生活不能被
志愿者活动替代；最后一句也说了公共生活并不只是政治生活，可以推出政治生活和志愿者
活动都是公共生活的组成部分。 


 
 
 
A.错误，没有提到政治生活越来越重要。 
 
B.错误，没有提到女性政治生活被低估。 
 
C.错误，政治生活并不是社会联系所必须的，志愿者活动就可以帮助女性形成社会联系。 
 
D.正确，文中说了公共生活不止是政治生活，但也说了志愿者活动不能替代正式的政治生活。 
 
E.错误，没有说政治生活和shadow citizenship 之间的关系。 
 
Passage 96 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：A 选项是削弱选项，如果欧洲和中国陶瓷技术相同，则更可能是欧洲学习中国了；B
选项依然是削弱，欧洲陶瓷和从中国引入的陶瓷相似，那么很有可能证明是学习了中国；C
选项依然是削弱，如果这些手稿是在1717 年从中国寄回去的话，那么则很有可能说明欧洲
陶瓷就是利用这些手稿来学习中国技术； 
 
D 选项属于无关选项，陶瓷材料之前没有被使用过不能证明欧洲人是自己研究出的陶瓷工
艺；E 选项正确，一个和中国陶瓷没有任何往来的陶瓷制造商确实能加强欧洲陶瓷是资助研
发这一结论。 
 
Passage 97 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章首先指出现象：编辑们因为国际新闻页面的减少而被批评。编辑关键是：读者应
该为减少担负全责，因为读者对于国际新闻的兴趣减少导致相关报道销量减少（首句黑体）；
但是作者认为：编辑仍然应当承担部分责任，理由是：编辑可以通过提高报道频率的方式来
增加读者的兴趣。由结构分析可知，第一个高亮句是支持编辑的理由，编辑的立场是作者反
对的立场；第二个高亮句是作者支持自己立场的理由，也是批评编辑辩解的理由。A 选项最
准确。 
 
Passage 98 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：H 这个东西通过吸入沉淀来摄取微生物，而重金属也经常吸附在这些沉淀上，所以H
可能会被沉淀上的重金属中毒，所以我们可以用一个地方的H 的含量来看这个地方重金属
的含量。那么这个结论就假设了H 一定会去吸入沉淀来获取微生物，所以D 选项符合答案，
因为如果微生物被别的污染物杀死了的话，那么H 就不会去吸入这些沉淀了，也就不会被
重金属中毒了。 


 
 
 
Passage 99 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：吃哺乳动物的鲸聚小群体，吃鱼的鲸聚大群体，然后原因是吃鱼的鲸聚集大群体是因
为他们要合作捕鱼，吃哺乳动物的鲸如果聚集太大就会被哺乳动物发现。然后问下面那个选
项能削弱，这个就是找他因即可，A 选项符合，因为说吃鱼的鲸自从出生就聚在自己的群体
中，而吃哺乳动物的鲸聚小群体是因为一旦群体变大他们就会出去组新的群体。 
 
Passage 100 
 
文章分析：雄性狮子的鬃毛有不同的特征。S 学者认为鬃毛的作用是保护雄狮的身体。且颜
色更深的鬃毛要好过浅色的作用。 但是目前这个结论无法验证。 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：根据句子的句内关系，高亮句子的后半句在此基础上提出了一个推测。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：定位but direct tests of this prediction are difficult。之后的句子里面回答为什么这个
预测的直接验证是困难的，在于观测的难度。 
 
Passage 101 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章首段介绍对森林角色的新认识：森林砍伐增加二氧化碳释放，加速全球变暖。二
段二氧化碳释放来源的角度讨论森林在全球变暖问题中的重要性。三个二氧化碳释放的主
要来源（1 石油燃料燃烧，2 树木腐败或燃烧，3 中高纬度森林突然有机物的腐败）之中，
有两个和森林相关。三段重点纠正对森林重要性认识的误区：过于关注热带森林生物多样性。
作者指出，中高纬度森林很重要，森林本身支持生命的能力很重要，应该认识到森林对土壤
与大气的重要性。四段总结强调森林的重要性：对于陆地生命，对于稳定大气构成都很重要。
该题针对文章主旨，根据文章结构尤其是四段总结，可确定A 选项。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：根据关键词biodiversity 定位到第三段。A 选项可定位到该句：Forests arefar more than 
simple collections of species, however, it is unfortunate thatthe discussion of biotic or living 
resources has been focused on biodiversityrather than on the actual ability of the land itself 
to support life. 
 
3. 答案：E 


 
 
 
解析：同上题一样定位到第三段。E 选项定位到该句：Butforests, it should be emphasized, 
have a similar role in every latitude theycontain the largest numbers of different kinds of 
plants and animals of anycommunity on land and might be considered the most highly 
developed of theterrestrial communities from the standpoint of complexity of structure 
anddiversity of life and life forms. 
 
4. 答案：C 
 
解析：题目针对三段主旨，根据三段结构分析可知C 选项最准确。D 选项原文有依据：Forests 
are far more than simplecollections of species。但该内容是支持段落主旨的理由。 
 
Passage 102  
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：定位最后一句，17 世纪的制图者并不存在美学和技术的分水岭，17 世纪的制图者们
认为自己既考虑美学因素也考虑了技术因素。   
 
A. inconsistent with the way some mapmakers prior to 1800 understand their own work 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：通过时间词 1980s 定位，Until the 1980s, in what Blakemore and Harley called “the 
Old is Beautiful Paradigm,” scholars largely focused on maps made before 1800, marveling 
at their beauty and sometimes regretting the decline of the pre-technical age. 
 
文章里交代的是20 世纪80 年代之前的状况，题干问的是20 世纪80 年代之后的情况。Until 
和题干里的beginning 告知我们这个推断题专门考查取反逻辑，时间互相取反，那么句子里
的动作也应当同时取反。再结合句内提到学者们开始注意到1800 年以前的地图非常精美，
有艺术成就，那么我们合理推断他们是有对照物的，才能得出前者更美的结论。因此答案选
Ｂ 
 
Passage 103 
 
1. 选 D 
 
虽然猩猩经历青春期发育的理论有了一方支持，但是多数生物学家对此仍保留怀疑态度，并
提供了两个怀疑的理由。 
 
2. 选 B 
 
 定位While the human adolescent growth spurt is physically obvious and affects virtually 
the entire body, the chimpanzee’s increased growth rate is detectable only through 


 
 
sophisticated mathematical analysis. 
 
人类的青春期发育，肉眼可见，且影响周身，相反黑猩猩的这种发育加速只能通过复杂的数
学分析确认。差异性比较可知， 不如人的明显 
 
3. 选 C 
 
定位While the human adolescent growth spurt is physically obvious and affects virtually the 
entire body, the chimpanzee’s increased growth rate is detectable only through 
sophisticated mathematical analysis. 
 
原因同上题，黑猩猩的发育加速只可通过复杂数学分析确认。 
 
Passage 104 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
定位文章第一句，现在的文化人类学家开始逐步反对1970 年代之前的文化人类学家的观点
了。之前的是经验主义的。注意那个时间状语是在从句里的，不可以迁移到主句中去，很多
同学错误理解了这个句子的时间而导致错误。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
现在的文化人类学家认为在研究上应当停止建立数据库，而应该去检查之前的内容，要给予
这些内容更人文的解读。 
 
Passage 105 
 
解析：文章主要是讲对19 世纪妇女travel writing 的评价。作者将她们与当时的female 
novelists 作比较。female novelists 意识到她们在打破边界，因此匿名或者用男人的假名，
而这四位写travel writing 的妇女（作者给他们的定义是：daring, solitary）其中三位，却拥
护传统的观点，回避妇女运动。后面作者又给出了一个对比：尽管female novelists 批判社
会，female travelers 却更愿意 leave society as it was while accomplishing their own liberation. 
（在实现自身自由的同时，不去改变社会）。这里就引出了第一题问的“contradiction”。后
面再次说明，Harper 的研究对象（也就是Female travelers），尽管在私下和公开场合都有
solitude（这是男性和权威的特有标志），但是这种solitude 却将任何妇女团结与集体行动排
除在外。 
 
1.答案 E 
 
定位contradiction，前后文都有线索，找到评价对象是“female travelers”。作者说了，她
们尽管在行为上大胆，但是意识上却很保守，因此活在矛盾中。E 选项是同义改写。 
 
A 错。A 前半句对，但后半句错。原文说他们是solitude（独立，孤立），但选项说among 


 
 
people， 正好相反。 
 
B 错。讨论对象错误。Contradiction 讨论的是female traveler 自身，而不是traveler 和writer
的对比。 
 
C 错。无中生有。 
 
D 错。讨论对象错误。理由同B。 
 
2. 选择AB  
 
根据solitude 找定位，定位到最后一句。For the subjects of Harper’s study, solitude in both 
the private and public spheres prevailed — a solitude that conferred authority, hitherto a 
male prerogative, but that also precluded any collective action or female solidarity. 
 
AB 选项正是这句话两个信息点的同义改写。 
 
C 错。无中生有。“它缓解了必须遵从传统价值的，来自周围人的压力。”文中没有提到。 
 
Passage 106 
 
解析：文章讨论的对象是19 世纪美国妇女写的小说。尽管很受欢迎，但是elite（精英人士）
并不爱读它们，而且ignore it as didactic. 然而，didacticism 这个特质在美国文学中自古有
之，而且被证实是传递社会价值观的最佳工具。（后提出证据，此句为高亮句）在19 世纪，
批评家批评了P 因为他没有在他的故事中加入moral tags（也就是didactic 的等价说法），
而L 因为didactic verse 被捧为圣人。尽管在19 世纪随着美国变成一个更世俗（secular）的
社会，修辞上anti-didactic 的倾向也能被觉察到，但是一直到20 世纪，才把审美价值凌驾
于其他事情之上，不再给didactic 空间。 
 
整篇文章就是为了反驳第一句话。（第一句话指出elite 不看19 世纪美国妇女小说是因为它
非常didactic。后面作者说了，19 世纪，didactic 是潮流，20 世纪才没有了这个空间。） 
 
1.答案：B 
 
高亮句 In the nineteenth century, critics reviled Poe for neglecting to conclude his 
 
stories with pithy moral tags, while Longfellow was canonized for his didactic 
 
verse.  是一个例子，用19 世纪的一个现象来证明前面作者的观点：didacticism 这个特质在
美国文学中自古有之，而且被证实是传递社会价值观的最佳工具。因此选B：assists in drawing 
a contrast between nineteenth-century and twentieth-century critics. 
 
A 错。没有提到20 世纪小说是否受欢迎，无中生有。 
 


 
 
C 错。定位句说的是19 世纪，选项中说的是20 世纪读者，无中生有。 
 
D 错。Question the usefulness 文中没有提到。 
 
E 错。同D，无中生有。 
 
2. 答案D 
 
【解析】词汇题。convey 在文中是“传递”之意，最接近的是impart。 
 
Imparting 告知，把…分给 
 
Imparting knowledge 固定用法,表示传授知识 
 
Passage 107 
 
解析：文章讲述了在Pleistocene epoch，一个岛上大象经历的“极速矮化”的现象。而这一
现象不只是P 时代才有，尽管证据缺少，但在更早的东南亚岛屿上，这种现象已经出现了。
随后作者对这种现象给出了几个解释。解释之一是，岛屿没有被大型掠食者占领，或者，岛
屿太小不足以支撑更多的掠食者。一旦没有了predation 的压力，大体型对于食草动物而言
就不再是优势。第二种解释是，岛屿上的食物资源有限，因此小一些的身体和对食物的更少
需求被favored。文章最后又提出了另一个现象：这种island rule 对于小型哺乳动物比如
rodents 来说，正好相反。在insular 条件下，大体型对于他们更有好处。 
 
1.选 D。主旨题。如上文所说，此文主旨是为大象矮化这一现象提供了多种可能解释。 
 
A 错。文中没有质疑。这是一篇现象解释型文章。 
 
B 错。这只是文中的一个细节，并非主旨。 
 
C 错。无中生有，没有提到adverse consequences。 
 
E 错。无中生有。文中没有contrast the effects。 
 
2. 选B。细节题。根据body size in mammals 定位到最后一句：Interestingly, the island rule 
is reversed for small mammals such as rodents, for which gigantism is favored under insular 
conditions. 这种island rule 对于小型哺乳动物比如rodents 来说，正好相反。在insular 条
件下，大体型对于他们更有好处。 
 
A 错。Under most conditions 无中生有。 
 
C 错。无中生有，文中没有提到easier to sustain in the absence of large predators. 
 
D 错。比较级的无中生有。 


 
 
 
E 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
Passage 108 
 
解析：文章讲的是20 世纪早期，小型杂志及其刊载的新式图像。作者认为它们塑造了先锋
派的风貌，预示着进步的理念和不同于传统的风格。这种风格抛弃了图片设计的传统规则：
take an idea and make it visually clear...and instantly understood. 相反，这些先锋艺术家专
为先锋艺术而创作的图片，很难去解码。作者认为，这种对传统的颠覆是寻求intellectual 
freedom 的一部分。这种对自由的冲动让先锋艺术家可以用新鲜的视角看待事物，呈现图文。 
 
1 选D。根据conventional graphic design 定位。 
 
定位句cardinal rule of graphic design: to take an idea and make it visually clear, concise, and 
instantly understood. 答案D 是这句话的同义改写。 
 
A 错。无中生有，文中没有提到conventional graphic design 和unpopular ideas 的关系。 
 
B 错。Bold fonts 无中生有。 
 
C 错。Nonsensical notions 无中生有。 
 
E 错。Previously unknown ideas 无中生有。 
 
2 选A 可多选题 &目的题 
 
提问先锋艺术家们创作出的无明确意义的图像目的是…… 
 
根据关键词定位到：This overturning of convention, this assailing of standard graphic and 
typographic formats, was part of a search for intellectual freedom. B C 均是未在文章中出现
的内容，无中生有。 
 
Passage 109 
 
解析：全文探讨的是“nation-state”这个称呼。H 和S 认为这个称呼是错误的，因为一个
单种语言、文化融合的state 从未存在过，即使在创造出“nation-state”这个概念的欧洲也
没有出现过。H 和S 认为，现代的欧洲states 是在文艺复兴后出现的。文艺复兴后，一些
nation（这里指：specific ethnic groups 特定的种族族群）在政治和经济上占有主导地位，
超越了其他的ethnic groups，因此形成了states。H 和S 认为，“nation-state”这个术语，
忽略了states 内在的文化和语言的多样性，他们更应该被称作“conquest states”。H 认为，
一个state 内多个民族的复兴并非“可能威胁到国家的主权管辖”，这点正如U 和S 所暗示
的那样; 相反，文化差异的断言有可能暴露征服国家历史上建立起来的种族中心主义信仰和
实践，从而为“nations-state”开辟了可能性。在这种“nations-state”中，被征服的族群
享有与征服族群相同的权利，但是不会面临迫害或文化同化的威胁。 


 
 
 
1.答案：A。  主旨目的题。 
 
H 和S 通过对学术用语（民族国家）提出质疑，来讨论与某种政治组织形式相关的问题。 
 
B 错。文中并没有examine the evolution of the terminology used to refer to. 
 
C 错。Justify 无中生有 
 
D 错。文章并没有质疑accuracy of a new term 
 
E 错。没有比较，无中生有。 
 
2. 答案：B。信息目的题。提问作者写到U 和S 的目的是什么。 
 
通过U 和S 这两位学者做定位词，找到对应的单句，“as U and S suggests”。说明U 和
S 对于前一句H 的观点是认可的：H 认为，一个state 内多个民族的复兴并非“可能威胁到
国家的主权管辖”。因此选B。U 和S 的存在是为了证明H 的观点。 
 
A 错。无中生有。  
 
C 错。并没有shift the focus。文中提到U 和S 只是一笔带过。 
 
D 错。作者的目的并不是为了指出H 和U&S 观点的相似之处。 
 
E 错。无中生有。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
  提问 H 和 S 两位学者如何定义nations 这个概念。缩写i.e.= that is 明显提示了答案
的所在位置。 
 
Passage 110 
 
解析：这篇文章讨论的是美国女权主义者。从1910 到1913 年，美国的女权主义者组织了
年度游行，而这些传统上是由男性进行的活动。这些女权主义的游行不仅仅是公开表达了女
权主义的团结，同时也是对社会规则的有意识的违反（transgression）：女性在街头的存在挑
战了传统的女性观念和对妇女行为的限制。在意识到游行作为社会变革的载体的同时，学者
们最近开始研究其作为一种抗议形式的缺点。L 将美国选举游行描述为“双刃剑”，他认为，
女性宣称团结的努力使她们成为媒体和公众的patronizing commentary 的“靶子”，也让
她们受到一些反女权主义者有组织的反对。 
 
1. 选E 
 


 
 
定位第一句 From 1910 to 1913, women suffragists in the United States organized annual 
parades— activity traditionally conducted by men to proclaim solidarity in some cause— 可
见男女游行都有“public declarations of solidarity”这个特点。 
 
A 错。非定位区间，且无中生有。 
 
B 错。无中生有。 
 
C 错。无中生有。非定位区间。 
 
D 错。无中生有。 
 
2. D  
 
推断题。题目问的是 “对于rules of social order”的支持者，文章suggest 了哪些？定位
到：a conscious transgression of the rules of social order: women’s very presence in the 
streets challenged traditional notions of femininity and restrictions on women’s conduct. 
 
组织和参与游行的人，与 proponents of the " rules of social order " 观点对立。 
 
A 错。文中并未提到他们对parades 的反对，他们反对的是“women suffragists”。 
 
B 错。无中生有。文中没有提到ulterior motives. 
 
C 错。无中生有。文中没有提及“they formed the core” 
 
E 错。无中生有。没有提到“they supported women’s rights to vote”. 
 
Passage 111 
 
解析：本文讨论的是对Jane Austen 的文学研究。与1980 年以前的大多数的研究不同，最
近的研究将Austen 的小说放在了她所处的时代洪流中进行分析。（Austen 生活于1775 年至
1817 年，她看到了法国和美国的革命以及拿破仑战争。）然后，F 指出了另一场在Austen 研

 C 是原文同义改写：传统的男性行为在 Austen 的时代改变了。 
 
A 错。无中生有，文中没有对比M 和A 
 
B 错。作者提到M 并非为了证明他对A 的影响力。 
 
D 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
E 错。Challenge aparticular misconception 无中生有。 
 
2. 选 D。定位到第一句：Unlikemost Jane Austen scholarship before 1980, much recent

Passage 112 
 
解析：本人讨论的B 与E 的研究。当B 通过虚构和个人见证来推动菲律宾民权在美国的发
展和菲律宾的社会转型，E 为自己设定了恢复菲律宾裔美国人生活史（life histories）的任务。
她的工作将1934 年至1965 年移民中断之后，菲律宾裔美国人的生活栩栩如生的展现出来。
E 工作中一特别的力量是，它代表了菲律宾裔美国女性。在1934 年美国人对菲律宾移民的
限制之前，移民中很少有菲律宾裔美国女性，但1965 年自由化以来，超过一半的菲律宾裔
女性移民到美国。E 的受访者记录了他们在美国不断变化的菲律宾身份认同感，就像B 作为
第一批大量移民潮的成员记录的一样。 
 
1. 选 D。根据题干定位到最后一句：Espiritu’s subjectsdocument their changing sense of 
Filipino identity in the United States, muchas Bulosan did as a member of the first substantial 
wave of immigrants. 
 
A 错，无中生有。没有提到responsesto life.

Passage 113 
 
1800 D 的英语对话新指南被广泛用于美国阅读教学。与其他早期作品不同的是，D 的作品，
强调了孩子们理解他们所读内容的重要性。虽然孩子实际上不太可能理解D 使用的所有词
汇，这至少是他声明的目标。D 意识到这些引言应该使儿童能够以他们已知的语言：speech
的形式，来解构印刷品中的文字。相比之下，许多早期的作者都认为，就像介绍性的拉丁文
教导儿童一种未知的语言，介绍性的英文文本也应该教英语就好像它也是一种未知的语言
一样。 
 
1. 答案：A 根据题干“earlierauthors”找定位句 In contrast, many earlier authors assumed 
that, just as introductoryLatin texts taught children an unknown language, introductory 
English textsshould teach English as if it, too, were an unknown language. 
 
B 错。文中没有这一信息。 
 
C 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
DE 同样错在无中生有。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
作者会同意以下哪种对比D 更早的英文入门读物作者的批评？这个文章里面没有直接写到，
需要推断。根据上一题定位句可知，在D 之前，人们认为应该把英语当成一种未知语言来
教，而D 认为，儿童应该理解他们所读语言。选择B 选项正确。 
 
A 错。文中没有提到grammar 的问题。 
 
C 错。文中没有提到subjectmatter。 
 
D 错。文中没有提到systematicway。 
 
E 错。文中没有提到pedagogicalmethod。 
 
Passage 114 
 
解析：许多学者认为，第二次世界大战期间政府对美国南部制造业的投资刺激了持续到战后
时期的区域经济繁荣。但这些投资大部分用于专业工厂，其中许多不适合战后生产。大规模
的战时政府资金导致弹药设施的数量和规模大幅增加。到战争结束时，已经建造了216 个
耗资超过35 亿美元的弹药工厂，其中许多位于南部。事实上，根据一项估计，阿拉巴马州，


 
 
阿肯色州，密西西比州和田纳西州超过70％的联邦政府资助的制造业建设资本进入了弹药
厂。即使在具有强大的战前经济的北部地区，一旦战争的必要性被消除，这些工厂很难处理。
在南方，很少有工业家有能力或愿意将这些工厂转变为和平时期的功能。因此，在战争结束
时，几乎所有的南部弹药设施都被关闭，处于待命状态，以非常低的容量运行，或转换为非
制造功能，通常是储存。虽然有些人在几年后重新开放供朝鲜战争期间使用，但特殊工厂对
南方战后经济的影响至多是微不足道的。 
 
1. 答案：B。 主旨题。根据原文的结构，可看出是驳论文。 
 
Many scholars have argued that governmentinvestment in manufacturing in the southern 
United States during the SecondWorld War spurred a regional economic boom that lasted 
into the postwar period.其后的内容，都是作者反驳这种观点。 
 
2. 答案：AB。多选题。 根据题干定位，原文第9 句和第8 句对应AB 两个选项。 
 
 atwar’s end almost all of the southern munitions facilities were shut down,placed 
 
on standby, operated at a very lowcapacity, or converted to nonmanufacturing functions, 
 
usually storage. Although some reopened afew years later for use during the Korean War, the 
 
impact of the special plants on the South’spostwar economy was marginal at best. 
 
C 错。二战后Continue tomanufacture munitions at high capacity 原文中没有提到。 
 
3. 答案：E。 信息目的题，定位至原文中这句话，举例子支持前一句： By the war’s end, 
216 
 
munitions establishment costing more than$3.5 billion had been built, many of them located 
in 
 
the south. 
 
A 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
B 错。“指出证据来支持文章开头学者的观点”，错误。 
 
C 错。这个例子并没有“excessive”的暗示。 
 
D 错。Largest 最高级的无中生有。 
 
4. 答案：C。信息目的题，考查句间句内关系（本题高亮句为原文第二句） 
 
原文提到specialized plants 是为了质疑政府投资的经济效用，本题选C。 


 
 
 
A 错。由but 可知不是support 而是一个驳斥的观点。 
 
B 错。没有提到是否“ineffective”。 
 
D 错。没有南北对比，无中生有。 
 
E 错。没有说到reasons。无中生有。 
 
5. 答案：D 
 
解析：利用题干当中的manufacturing facilities built in the southern states 定位，会发现有
多处对应，故而本题采用选项进行双定位。其中D 选项对应原文第八句的内容，属于同义
替换，故而本题选D。此外，ABCE 四个错误选项均属于比较关系的无中生有，选项所示比
较在原文均找不到依据。 
 
6. 答案：A 
 
解析：本题考点与第四题有重合，答案选A。政府投资到底对战后经济有多大程度的影响，
是本文争论的焦点。 
 
Passage 115 
 
解析：虽然现在已经灭绝的passenger pigeons 在18 世纪和19 世纪的美国都很多，但对于
12 世纪Cahokian 遗址（在如今的美国）的考古研究检查了家庭食物垃圾，发现这种鸽子的
痕迹非常罕见。鉴于这些遗址与19 世纪约翰·詹姆斯·奥杜邦（John James Audubon）记录
的巨大的passenger pigeon 栖息地接近，并且Cahokians 消耗了几乎每一个其他动物蛋白
质来源，进行研究的考古学家得出结论：在此之前，passenger pigeon 数量一直非常有限，
直到后哥伦比亚美国时期，才剧烈增长。其他考古学家批评了这些结论，他们认为这些鸽子
骨头不太可能被保留。但是，所有的考古项目发现了大量的鸟骨，甚至还有来自鱼类的小骨
头。 
 
1，答案：E。目的题，一般都是解释前一句。 
 
根据题干定位到最后一句，根据前句和再前句的两次转折，可以知道考古学家内部出现了分
歧，分裂成了两派，并且作者defend 了前者。 
 
A B 错在无中生有。 
 
C 错。作者在文中没有提到extinction 的theory。 
 
D 错。与文章相反。文中有两批学者，作者支持的是第一批，反对第二批。 
 
2. 答案：E。类似逻辑削弱题。 


 
 
 
提供它因，旅鸽不会在某地栖息太久，可能在12 世纪旅鸽未在C 地区周围生活。 
 
Passage 116 
 
解析：女权主义学者倾向于认为19 世纪美国的女性选择保持单身，是为了拥护女性独立，
并批评婚姻作为一种压迫性的制度。的确，许多19 世纪参与改革运动的美国女性或者自称
为作家和专业人士的女性都是单身。然而，这种对单身女性的看法往往会扭曲其选择的含义。
十九世纪将爱的婚姻视为一种精神理想。因此，如果妇女们无法实现这样一个理想的婚姻状
态的话，那么女性不结婚就成了社会可接受的。因此，许多女性保持单身的选择不是对婚姻
的负面看法，而是一种非常理想化的看法。 
 
1. 答案： D。推理题。定位到原文：Thenineteenth century saw the elevation of marriage 
for love as a spiritual ideal.怀疑自己的婚姻，不能达到自己对理想婚姻的期待。 
 
A 错。文中没有提到GIVE UPAUTONOMY. 
 
B 错。没有提到被别人所影响。 
 
C 错。无中生有。 
 
E 错。Negative view 错。 
 
2. 答案：A。可多选题  
 
  要记得选择作者支持的观点：单身的选择不是因为要拥护独立，反对压迫，而是因为一
种特定的对婚姻的态度。 
 
Passage 117 
 
解析：许多研究人员将具有不同进化历史的鸟类和哺乳动物之间的大量生理和行为相似性
归因于endothermy（一种通过内部热源维持温暖体温的体温调节策略）。然而，Farmer 认
为父母关怀而不是吸热是了解哺乳动物和鸟类之间相似性的关键。根据Farmer 的说法，虽
然endothermy 提供了一些相似性的解释，例如身体绝缘的存在，但endothermy 只是许多
与父母照顾有关的特征之一。研究人员最常提到的endothermy 的两个优点是1）更广泛的
可居住环境和2）持续剧烈运动的能力。但新陈代谢大幅增加（以极高的能源成本），因此
赋予了前者所说的优势，而且没有因果的生物学联系来解释为什么endothermy 对于维持运
动至关重要。Farmer 认为，endothermy 是一种控制孵化温度的手段，同时，维持运动的能
力是单独进化的，作为提高父母觅食能力和提供幼崽食物的能力的一种手段。 
 
1. 答案A。 主旨题。 
 
A 正确。少数派Farmer 的解释驳斥了多数派manyresearchers 的解释。 
 


 
 
BC 错。作者的目的是驳斥，而不是summarize 和defend。 
 
D 错。作者并不是反对particularresearcher。 
 
E 错。文中没有compare theresults。 
 
2. 答案A。考察各论点论据展开的时间先后。 
 
该文章从针锋相对的两个解释展开，第二个解释后面提供了依据做论据。 
 
3. 答案E。问“Farmer 在哪里让步了” 
 
【定位句】According to Farmer, while endothermy provides an explanation for afew 
similarities, 
 
such as the presence of body insulation. 可以推出，Farmer 认可endothermyprovides an 
explanation for the presence of body insulation。 E 正确 
 
Passage 118 
 
解析：在睡眠功能理论中，突出的是M 的“不动假说”，它认为睡眠而不是服务于恢复功
能，而是在动物无法有效参与其他活动的时候起到保护作用。M 认为，那些没有立即被掠食
者威胁的动物会更安全，如果他们在这段时间中睡觉的话。然而，这个假设不能轻易解释为
什么人们经常在睡眠剥夺后，在睡眠时间或强度上会反弹。该假设也没有解释各种睡眠状态
的存在，这些状态本身可能与不同的功能有关。 
 
1. 答案：AB。 
 
可多选题。题干问的是“不动假说”没有解释下面哪些事实？定位到第二段（作者反驳部分） 
 
A 选项定位句 
 
Neither does the hypothesis explain theexistence of various states of sleep, which themselves 
may be associated withdifferent functions. 
 
B 选项定位句 
 
One often observes a rebound in sleep timeor intensity following a period of sleep deprivation. 
 
C 错。原文中没有提到。无中生有。 
 
2. 答案：B。 
 
reasoned that 表示对前面所做表述的解释，是常见的引导论据支持论点的说法。 


 
 
 
所以是the basis of a hypothesis 
 
A 错。文中没有提到qualify awidely accepted view. 是进一步解释M 的观点。 
 
C 错。Applied in a branchof science 没有提到。 
 
D 错。无中生有，么有说啊都testedempirically. 
 
E 错。无中生有。 
 
Passage 119 
 
解析：1919 年，英国经历了有史以来最大的工业工时减少，达到每周48 小时。在D 看来，
48 小时工作周对英国20 世纪20 年代经济表现不佳起到了重要作用。D 认为，工时减少加
上快速工资增长，推动了价格上涨。然而，G 和O 现第一次世界大战（1914-1918）对英国
的竞争力构成了更强大的负面宏观经济冲击。S 认为，D 的论点忽视了大量的证据，即当小
时数从高基数水平降低时，每小时的生产力会提高。至关重要的是，D 的论文并未承认，目
前大多数工业化国家的工业工人每周工作时间都减少到大约48 小时，这破坏了与其他国家
相比，任何减少工时对工业生产力的潜在影响。 
 
1，答案：E。类似于逻辑单题（加强）。 
 
S 的观点定位到文中：Scott arguesthat Dowie’s thesis ignores considerable evidence that 
 
hourly productivity improves when hours arereduced from a high base level. E 选项中，公司
发现每位员工的总产出不一定会被每位员工的工作小时数的减少而改变。也就是说，每个人
的产出效率提高了。一道围绕数量关系展开的逻辑题，要看清出文章里给的逻辑。 
 
2，答案：C。定位到G 和O 的观点：However,Greasly and Oxley found that the First World 
War(1914-1918) constituted a morepowerful negative macroeconomic shock to Britain’s 
competitiveness. 也就是G 和O 认为，第一次世界大战对英国经济的负面影响更大。 
 
C 选项 1920s 就是对应1914—1918。 
 
Passage 120 
 
解析：小行星在持续时间内存在可以令岩石熔化的高温的发现令人费解：小行星的热源未知，
而且与行星大小的物体不同，小行星这样的小物体很快就会散热。R 认为，小行星的热量可
能来自小行星之间的碰撞。怀疑论者认为，单次撞击会使小行星的整体温度上升很少，而且
在撞击积蓄热量之间，小行星会过快地冷却。然而，这些反对意见都认为小行星是密度高的
固体。最近有发现认为，小行星是多孔的，这使得R 的假设更加合理。当固体碰撞时，会喷
射出大量碎屑，耗散能量。而多孔体产生的碎屑较少，因此更多的能量用于产生热量。当碎
片落回撞击坑时，可以保留热量，形成绝缘毯。 


 
 
 
1. 答案：B。 
 
题目问，其中一个让小行星的高温难以解释的因素是？定位到文中：However, these 
objections assumed that asteroids are dense, solidbodies。对应B 选项。 
 
2. 答案：C。可多选题，推理题。 
 
R 可能会否认文中提到的怀疑派的什么观点？也就是找出怀疑派质疑R 的观点。 
 
R 认为热量来自碰撞，质疑者认为不正确。还是在讨论collisions 产生对asteroids 的温度影
响。 
 
A 错。关于porous bodies 碰撞是否产生更少Debris,不在他们的争议区间。 
 
B 错。无中生有。 
 
Passage 121 
 
解析：本杰明富兰克林在美国历史上被描绘为典型的白手起家式的人物。在“自力更生”这
本书中，E 问道，“能指导富兰克林的大师在哪里......？”事实上，富兰克林广泛接受教导，
他的科学工作是高度协作性的。英国的朋友们在费城发送了他的电子实验所需的设备，其他
人则在费城帮助他在那里建立了自己的工作室。Philip Syng 构建了一种用于产生电荷的装
置，而Tomas Hopkinson 则展示了尖端导体的潜力。富兰克林除了担任该集团的理论家外，
还撰写并公布了其成果。他作为个体研究员的名声在一定程度上是由于一个人写一个群体
的发现，历史有时会给予个人以集体努力的功劳。 
 
1.，答案：C。问高亮句的作用。最后一句，是作者自己的总结：His fame as an individual 
researcher is partly a consequence of the shorthand by which when one person writes about 
a group’s discoveries, history sometimes grants singular credit for collective effort. 
 
C 选项：用一个更为广泛的学术现象，揭示了富兰克林的reputation。正确。 
 
2，答案：B。根据题干定位Emerson：In “Self-reliance”, Emerson asks, “Where is the 
master who could have instructed Franklin...?”它的作用是支持第一句。强调本杰明富兰克
林在美国历史上被描绘为典型的白手起家式的人物。而作者对这一观点是持质疑态度的，因
此选择B。 
 
Passage 122 
 
解析：长期以来，墨西哥湾一直有死亡地带（水的含氧量太低，无法维持大多数生命形式），
这里接收密西西比河的水域。科学家研究了海湾最近死亡区发生地区的沉积物岩心。科学家
们测量了沉积物的年代，计算了沉积物中有孔虫（海洋原生动物）的种类。这些物种在低氧
水域中茁壮成长。早在1823 年，有孔虫就在密西西比河洪水期（营养水平增加期间）蓬勃


 
 
发展，表明洪水中的营养物质可以引发低氧水。1950 年后，当农民开始使用富含营养的肥
料时，核心样本中的有孔虫最为丰富。研究人员认为，增加化肥的使用会导致更加极端的死
区。 
 
1，答案：E。句子功能作用题，提问举例的目的。 
 
  例子在前，观点在后，是倒着总结的，因此选 E。 
 
2，答案：A。可多选题，推理题。 
 
定位到：Researchers believe that increased use of fertilizer leads to moreextreme dead zones. 
 
A：如果减少化肥的使用量， dead zone 会减少。正确 
 
B 错误。继续使用化肥，会加重deadzone  会增强 
 
C 错误。停止了化肥，会减轻，但是不会消失，毕竟洪水期也会有。 
 
Passage 123 
 
解析：生物学家知道，一些海藻可以通过产生气体二甲基硫化物（DMS）产生云，DMS 与
海洋上空的氧气反应形成固体颗粒。这些颗粒提供了一个表面，水蒸气可以凝结在该表面上
形成云。L 认为这个过程是全球气候控制系统的一部分。根据L 的说法，地球就像一个超级
有机体，其所有的生物和物理系统都在合作以保持健康。他假设温暖的条件会增加藻类活动
和DMS 输出，播种更多的云，通过阻挡太阳来冷却地球。然后，随着气候变冷，藻类活动
和DMS 水平降低，循环继续。为了回应生物学家的质疑（他们质疑有机体为自己的自私目
的而工作的方式是如何演变成一种不仅有益于地球而且有益于生物的方式），L 指出，冷却
有益于留在海洋表面的藻类，因为它允许冷却的海洋上层下沉，然后循环水从下面的深处向
上运送养分。藻类也可能受益于从它们帮助形成的云层中下来的氮气。 
 
1. 答案：C。 
 
定位到：Lovelock points out that cooling benefits the algae, which remain at the ocean surface, 
because it allows the cooled upper layers of the ocean to sink, and then the circulating water 
carries nutrients upward from the depths below. 这句话是C 的同义改写。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
   thermostat 是自动调温器，与文章内所介绍的藻类通过 DMS 造云来控制cooling 
process 的循环机制相同。 
 
3. 答案：A。“文章提到雨对algae 的好处是为了什么” 
 
定位到最后一句，后面这两句都是为了展示L 反驳生物学家质疑说提出的观点。L 的结论是


 
 
藻类通过 DMS 控制天气，也是地球自我调节过程的一部分。质疑者说藻类当然应该进化出
对自己的生存有益的行为。L 证明了，藻类的行为不但有利于地球，也有利于自己，这个双
赢的逻辑正确。因此答案选A。 
 
4. 答案：D。组织结构题。 
 
本文开头提出一个现象，随后对这个现象提供了理论解释，同时与解释相关的质疑也得到回
应。本题选D。（注意，reservation 在此处的含义为doubt） 
 
5. 答案：D。推理题，根据L 的观点来选择正确答案。 
 
本题的答案，可以由文中，L 是如何回应biologists 的质疑得到。In response to…, Lovelock 
points out that cooling benefits the algae,…可知D 选项正确，他们忽略了这一点。 
 
6. 答案：E。本题与第四题考点重合，答案选E。 
 
A 错。文章的主旨并不是为了解释温度的作用。 
 
B 错。Outline the sequence 不对。这明显是一篇驳论文。有观点，有质疑。 
 
C 错。前半部分对，后半部分错，他们争议的不是algae 在云的形成中扮演的角色。 
 
D 错。无中生有。 
 
Passage 124 
 
解析：当地球在46 亿年前形成时，太阳的燃烧率仅为现在的70％。然而，直到23 亿年前，
地质记录中没有证据表明存在广泛的冰川作用。S 和M 在20 世纪70 年代提出氨，一种温
室气体，在温暖早期地球的大气层，但随后的研究表明，太阳的紫外线会在无氧环境中迅速
破坏氨，例如早期的地球。现在，许多科学家将早期地球变暖的大部分归因于不耐氧 
 
的微生物 - M - 产生温室气体甲烷。这种假说可以帮助解释第一个全球冰河时代：23 亿年
前，地球大气开始充满其他微生物产生的氧气 - C - 导致M 迅速下降。 
 
1.答案：B。 
 
问的是高亮句的作用，作者已经在高亮句中指出，M 这一假设可以帮助解释第一个全球冰
河时代。因此能看出作者的态度是支持的。因此选B。 
 
2. 答案：E。定位M，找到相关句：Many scientists now attribute much of the warming of 
early Earth to oxygen-intolerant microbes—methanogens—that produce the greenhouse 
gas methane. The methanogen hypothesis could help to explain the first global ice age: 2.3 
billion years ago, Earth’s atmosphere began to fill with oxygen produced by other 
microbes—cyanobacteria—causing methanogens to decline rapidly. 


 
 
 
E 的意思是：如果methanogens 比 cyanobateria 出现的晚，作用就不那么重要了。正确，
因为后者会杀死前者，前者的暖化作用就被削弱了。 
 
Passage 125 
 
解析：一些研究人员声称鲸类（鲸鱼和海豚）具有文化，研究人员将其定义为相互学习的能
力。然而，怀疑论者要求明确的证据表明，鲸目动物可以通过某种形式的社会学习获得新的
行为，最好是明确的模仿或教学实例。但是很难获得这样的证据。虽然很少有人怀疑圈养鲸
类擅长模仿，或者他们重现了研究人员教授的行为，但生物学家寻求洞察鲸类动物在其自然
栖息地中的行为必须依赖于演绎而不是实验。如果特定群体的成员分享不是由遗传继承或
环境变异引起的行为，那么他们几乎肯定通过观察，跟踪或听取其他动物来学习它们。 
 
1. 答案：B。  
 
高亮句为最后一句，它的功能就是为了举例说明前一句话中提到的 deduction 。 
 
A 错。Complicates biologists’ ability 无中生有。 
 
C 错。解释为何怀疑者remain unpersuaded 无中生有。 
 
D 错。没有introduce a claim. 
 
E 错。Previously overlooked factor 无中生有。 
 
2. 选E。 
 
最后作者认可，确实They exhibit tendencies that suggest a capacity for the kind of behavior 
that qualifies as cultural. 
 
A 错。文中已经认可，他们有social learning，这个并不是a subject of disagreement. 
 
B 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
C 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
D 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
Passage 126 
 
解析：比太阳更热，更大，被称为“stragglers”的恒星对天文学家来说是令人费解的，因为
这些快速燃烧的恒星按理说不会在古代星团中持续存在。一些研究人员认为，当两颗古老的
低质量恒星碰撞并合并形成更大质量，更热的恒星时，形成了典型的Blue stragglers。PL 却
认为，在低密度球状星团中，单星之间的合并很少发生，以解释观察到的Blue stragglers 的


 
 
数量。这些Blue stragglers 应该是由一组恒星创建的。他认为，已经相互绕行的一对恒星为
第三颗恒星或另一颗恒星提供了更大的目标。一旦这个新的分组形成，星星之间的近距离接
触可能会促使任何两个合并为Blue straggler。PL 模型预测每个Blue straggler 都有一个遥远
的轨道同伴，正如银河系M67 星团中的许多Blue stragglers 所展示的那样。 
 
1，答案：C。信息目的题——考察讨论对象等细节。 
 
直接通过larger target 定位，看到该定位句，He suggests that a pair of stars already orbiting 
each other presents a larger target for a third star or another pair. 本句的讨论对象为：a pair 
of stars，而larger target 是想说明，a pair of stars 更容易与第三颗或另一对星星发生反应。
C 选项正确。 
 
ABDE，可以直接根据讨论对象不符合而排除，因为这四个选项都提到了blue straggler，虽
然这是全文的讨论对象，但是就本句而言，a pair of stars 才是该句要解释的对象。 
 
2， 答案：B。推断题。本题的第一反应是用blue stragglers 来进行定位，但是随后发现，
全文都是blue stragglers，所以，应该转变解题思路，从选项入手，利用选项来定位，并判
定该选项是否正确。 
 
A 错。文中说的是stragglers are hotter and more massive than the Sun；而选项说的是组成
blue stragglers 的stars are hotter and more massive than the Sun。比较对象错误。 
 
B 选项正确，定位到第一句：Hotter and more massive than the Sun, stars called “stragglers” 
are puzzling to astronomers because such rapidly burning stars would not be expected to 
persist in ancient star clusters. 也就是说，stragglers 的特征是rapidly burning；而这一特征
原本是不应该出现在ancient star clusters 的。也就是说，blue stragglers 比其他恒星燃烧的
更快。 
 
C 错。blue stragglers are older than … 文中找不到对应的依据。 
 
D 错。定位到第三句，blue straggler 与pairs of stars 的数量对比，在文中无依据。 
 
E 错。originate the oldest stars 无依据。 
 
3， 答案：E。相当于逻辑单题中的削弱题。 
 
一定要注意题干中提到的The passage cites which of the following as evidence… 说明，文
中有提到证据来削弱第二句的观点。由文章结构，可知这是第三句的内容，alternatively 体
现出对比关系。Peter Leonard 指出，mergers between single stars 太少，而不足以解释the 
observed quantity of blue stragglers。由此，E 选项正确。 
 
其余选项都不是文中提到的evidence。 
 
 


 
 
Passage 127 
 
解析：大多数地震学家认为，在发生大地震及其余震之后，断层（地壳的压力可以引发地震
的断裂）将保持平静，直到压力有时间重建，通常是数百年或数千年。但是，最近的证据（地
震之间有微妙的相互作用）可能会推翻这一假设。根据压力触发假设，当相邻断层发生变化
时，断层会意外地对他们获得的细微压力十分敏感。在地震中沿着断层传播的压力不仅仅是
消散，而是集中在附近的地方。即使最小的附加压力也可能沿着断层或附近的断层引发另一
次地震。尽管科学家们长期以来认为这种微妙的相互作用并不存在，但这一假设已经解释了
加利福尼亚州，日本和土耳其几次破坏性地震后地震的位置和频率。 
 
1.选 E。定位recent seismological evidence. 
 
定位句：Recent evidence of subtle interactions between earthquakes may overturn this 
assumption, however. 后面是关于这个新证据的详细解释。多数地震学家提出观点，然而最
近发现的一些，地震之间存在细微互动的证据，可能推翻这种假设。E 选项是大多数地震学
家的关系，这点被recent evidence 给invalidated 了。 
 
A 错。这点不是recent evidence 反驳的对象。 
 
B 错。无中生有。 
 
C 错。这点不是大多数地震学家的观点，而是recent evidence 支持的。 
 
D 错。无中生有。 
 
2. 可多选题 答案：AC。 
 
问的是Most seismologists 的观点，定位到第一句。他们认为断层经过一次地震后，要安静
一段时间，等积蓄了足够力量才会再次爆发。 
 
B 选项因为是作者支持的假设，因此不选。 
 
Passage 128 
 
解析：M 和Wi 认为，岛屿的生物多样性将与岛屿大小的函数成正比（即较大的岛屿可以支
持更多的物种），并且与其与大陆的距离的函数成反比（即，许多偏远的岛屿往往会支持更
少的物种）。岛屿背景下生物多样性的减少可能需要人口进行调整。E 认为，这种限制使得
岛屿成为研究人类适应自然环境的理想实验室，而R 和Wa 在他们对Melos 的研究介绍中， 
 
也将这种生物多样性限制作为“岛屿生态系统的重要特征”。然而，对于人类社区而言，这
种限制可能会被其他因素所抵消。岛屿生态系统生物多样性的减少仅适用于陆地资源：海洋
资源将与任何其他沿海地区一样丰富，这些海洋资源对人类社区可能同样重要。像马耳他或
梅洛斯这样的小岛允许所有人类社区直接进入海洋，提供重要的营养“安全网”，以及膳食
多样性的一个要素，这实际上可能使岛屿社区比其内陆同行更具优势。群岛也可能有特定的


 
 
非生物资源（如梅洛斯的黑曜石），可用于与其他岛屿和邻近大陆上的交换。 
 
1.答案：C。主旨题。 
 
前面众人的观点被后面的内容质疑。 
 
Reduced biodiversity in an island context is likely to require significant adaptation on the part 
of colonizing human populations. For human communities, however, this limitation may 
potentially be offset by other factors. 
 
2. 答案：ABC。可多选题。 
 
并列逻辑 …as well as… may also 
 
定位句：A small island such as Malta or Melos allows all communities direct access to 
 
the sea, providing an important nutritional “safety net,” as well as an element of dietary 
diversity, which may actually give island communities an advantage over their landlocked 
counterparts. Islands may also have specific nonbiological resources (such as obsidian on 
Melos), which may be used in exchange with communities on other islands and adjacent 
mainlands. 
 
3. 答案：A。问E 的观点，定位到：Evans argues that this limitation makes islands ideal 
laboratories for the study of human adaptations to the natural environment 
 
Evan 认为生物多样性和岛上有的资源是相关的, 从后面反驳可以看出作者认为Evans 过于
强调，或只强调 terrestrial resources 了，没有看到海洋资源的因素。 
 
Passage 129 
 
解析：一个关键的共识已经出现，M 将主要作为一个essayist 而不是一个novelist 被人们记
住。尽管她拥有一个辩论和成为话语作家的强大天赋，以及有着作为一个牺牲情感的知识分
子的声誉，M 最好的文章的力量是她的虚构（对应novelist）而不是严格的智力天赋（对应
essayist）。她通过讲故事或通过生动的描述，捕捉图像和微妙的表征来表达自己的观点。M
最大的贡献是模糊不同类型的写作之间的区别：她展示小说如何向思维开放，以及essay 如
何从小说技巧中获益。 
 
1. 答案：ABC。问的是M 的写作特征，从选项中寻找，与原文对应。 
 
A 对应：what powers McCarthy’s best essays are her fictional rather than strictly intellectual 
gifts 
 
B 对应：McCarthy’s greatest contribution was to blur the distinctions between different 
kinds of prose writing 


 
 
 
C 对应：And for all her exacting sense of fact... 
 
2.答案：D。词汇题“discursive”的含义。 
 
Discursive :using logic reasoning but not intuition 
 
Passage 130 
 
解析：一些考古学家推测，美洲可能最初在4 万至25，000 年之间被殖民化。然而，为了支
持这一理论，有必要解释在现在的美国，在该时间间隔内缺乏普遍让人接受的居住地点。澳
大利亚的土地面积比美国小，有许多这样的地点，这些可以支持这个结论：澳大利亚至少在
4 万年前被人类殖民。澳大利亚的人口密度较低（导致发现这种地点的机会更小），并且其
整体干旱程度会让hunter-gatherer 的人群更不利。按比例来说，澳大利亚沿海地区由于冰
后期海平面上升而损失的土地面积，至少与美国相同，因此，澳大利亚的任何沿海考古记录
应该像美国的沿海记录一样，已经耗尽。既然有如此多的资源丰富的河流从美国海岸线向内
陆引导，看起来难以置信的是，越来越多的人类将自己限制在沿海地区数千年。如果居民在
25000 年前出现，那么他们出现在考古记录中的可能性似乎要大于澳大利亚。 
 
1，答案：A。主旨题。 
 
第一句的观点被负面点评，后面作者一直通过澳大利亚与美国的对比，来证明美国25000 年
前没有人类居住。最后一句 If inhabitants were present 25,000 years ago, the chances of their 
appearing in the archaeological record would seem to be greater than for Australia.重申了观
点。 
 
2，答案：E。推理题，根据25,000 年定位。文中多处提到25,000 年，要从选项来过滤。 
 
A 错。比较级的无中生有。 
 
BCD 错。错误原因同A。 
 
E 根据第五句推出。第五句提到：because of postglacial sea-level rise... 
 
3，答案：D。推理题，这道题同样要根据选项反推。“文章作者认为，如今美国缺失25000-
40000 年间人类居住的证据，是因为...” 
 
A 错。The oldest 错误，无中生有。 
 
B 错。Facilitated the dispersal of early inhabitants 与原文的说法相反。Since there are so many 
resource-rich rivers leading inland from the United States coastlines, it seems implausible that 
a growing population of humans would have confined itself to coasts for thousands of years.
原文说的是，假设美国在25000-40000 年间有人居住的话，那为什么没有evidence 呢？（没
有evidence 可能是海岸居民的居住证据因为sea-level rise 而被冲走了）那么，美国有很多


 
 
内陆资源丰富的河流，人类怎么把自己限制在coast 几千年（而不去内陆）？言下之意，这
段时间内，没有内陆居民的记录。 
 
C 错。无中生有。文中没有提到sparsely populated. 
 
D 正确。这是从原文可以直接推出的结论。 
 
E 错。无中生有。 
 
Passage 131 
 
1. D 句子作用题 对应第二个划线句子 
 
前文说客观事实是少吃更健康，科学家们早期解读是因为新陈代谢慢，产生的有毒产物增殖
也慢。后来发现少吃也不并不减慢代谢，科学家看法改变。划线句子本身是个案例，对此进
行支持。 
 
2. 可多选题 
 
A  presumption 指代早先科学家们提出的观点，empirical findings 指的是后文实际观察的
内容，表明后面的实际例子与前面的观点矛盾。 
 
Passage 132 
 
文章解析： 
 
文章整篇是对相反观点的对比介绍。文章开头是B &H 关于 deindustrialization 表明的观点：
1960 年代后期美国制造业的外流导致“hollowing out”效果，国内大量工厂关闭造成工人
进入不稳定的低收入工作，或者直接失业。二句是批评者相反的观点：新的服务和高技术部
门最近创造了大量工作。三句（however 句）指出的是反对二句的证据：hourglass effect(收
入的两极分化，技术精英只为前产业工人带来低收入工作机会)。 
 
1.  答案：B 
 
解析：目的题。根据文章结构可知，B 是最准确概括：针对一个经济现象（deindustrialization）
呈现不同观点。 
 
A 选项，contributed 没有依据。 
 
C 选项，the short-term and long-term effects 没有依据。 
 
D 选项，a dominant theory 文章没有体现。作者介绍相反观点，没有说哪种更dominant. 
 
E 选项，new evidence 文章不明显。 


 
 
 
2.  答案：D 
 
解析：题目要求找最能削弱B &H 的deindustrialization 的选项。由首句可知，B&H 核心观
点是：坏影响，空洞化，导致工人低收入失业。直接说产业工人高收入的选项应该是最直接
的反驳削弱。D 选项，大量产业工人经过训练成为高技能，高收入的计算机工人。 
 
A 选项，since the mid-1960,时间点明显不对。 
 
3.  答案：A 
 
解析：定位”critics””hourglass”关键词到文章倒数一、二句，概括倒数一、二句可得A
选项。 
 
Passage 133 
 
文章解析： 
 
文章整体是比较典型的驳论文。文章开头是一些历史学家对”widely held belief”的质疑：
这些历史学家认为19 世纪末到20 世纪中期的教育进步没有美国南部黑人获得权力。之后
是这些历史学家用来支持自己观点的理由证据。到Nonetheless 句，文章作者直接跳出来反
对这些历史学家：作者认为教育进步对黑人的经济政治权力有贡献。之后是作者的理由。 
 
1.  答案：C 
 
解析：根据引用内容定位到文章第2 句冒号后。C 选项unevenness 是对冒号之前never 
steady 的同义改写。 
 
2.  答案：E 
 
解析：文章高亮句出现在文章中间，之前是一些历史学家的观点及理由。之后是作者质疑反
对一些历史学家的观点理由。E 选项“qualifes”理解为“限定”。 
 
3.  答案：C 
 
解析：根据关键词“Civil Rights movement”定位到文章末句。根据末句及整体文章结构（转
折后说教育进步的正面贡献）可得C 选项。 
 
Passage 134 
 
文章解析：文章是比较典型的驳论。开头是老观点：对资源的竞争决定物种在特定生态系统
中的位置。However 转折后，作者用红松鼠和灰松鼠的例子，来说明资源竞争之外的因素。
红松鼠在灰松鼠引入之前就有周期性族群数量循环。灰松鼠携带疾病，都是作者指出的竞争
外因素。 


 
 
 
1.  答案：D 
 
解析：题目问作者提到灰松鼠觅食效率的目的。定位到倒数第2 句，根据although 可知是
作者的让步。 
 
2.  答案：C 
 
解析：题目问作者对于早期观点的评价。根据文章结构可知应偏向负评价：关于物种在特定
生态系统中的位置，作者认为其忽视了资源竞争之外的其他因素。C 最准确。 
 
Passage 135 
 
文章解析：文章是关于1970 年代旧金山Chicano 族群壁画艺术的评论。首段主要是将其与
之前壁画的对比：早期是政府主导的，1970 年代是人民自发的。早期是艺术家个人的，1970
年代是艺术家和社区群众一起的。二段把Chicano 族群壁画艺术放到一个大的历史背景下：
Chicano 族群壁画艺术是Chicano 人民民权运动的手段，壁画艺术促进了民权运动。 
 
1.  答案：E 
 
解析：题目问文章的主要目的，通过文章结构分析可知E 最准确：二段的当代政治背景可理
解为历史背景，首段与早期比较也可理解为历史背景。 
 
2.  答案：E 
 
解析：通过关键词定位到最后一句。该句”They”指代前句”Artists”。E 是该句概括改写。 
 
3.  答案：B 
 
解析：题目问两个段落之间的关系。通过文章结构分析可知B。 
 
Passage 136 
 
文章解析：文章是Phelps 作品的评论。首句暗含作者的观点是：Phelps 1882 年的小说Doctor 
Zay 之前的作品也应该被关注到，后文可以看作是支持首句暗含观点的理由：这些作品促进
了内战后女性医生地位的提升。 
 
1.  答案：B 
 
解析：题目问作者会同意的关于Phelp 作品的观点。 
 
A 错在后半句，关于小说Doctor Zay 作用文章没有提到。 
 
B 是概括文章可得的观点。 


 
 
 
C 的比较从文章得不到。 
 
2.  答案：ABC 
 
解析：题目问文章中有依据的陈述。 
 
A 依据二句：in the face of pernicious resistance 
 
B 也可以依据二句：These writings underscored the achievements…… 
 
C 依据首句：…… preceding it were many little-known writings by Phelps 
 
Passage 137 
 
文章解析：文章开头提出观点：鸟的羽毛妨碍我们对鸟生理机能的理解。后文通过和哺乳动
物的对比说明观点。哺乳动物肌肉运动直观，和人的很像，好理解。鸟有羽毛遮挡，我们看
不到内在运动。 
 
1.  答案：ABC 
 
解析：题目问关于鸟的羽毛的效果。 
 
A 依据首句。 
 
B 依据首句。 
 
C 依据首句。 
 
 2.  答案：E 
 
解析：依据关键词定位到倒数第3 句“With a mammal….”依据本句和前句，结合与鸟的对
比，可知E 选项。 
 
Passage 138 
 
文章解析：文章是对于Gerstmann 在1920 年代发现的评论。Gerstmann 发现：大脑特定区
域的损伤可能与手指控制能力及数学理解能力有关。作者二句but 转折后倾向支持
Gerstmann 的发现。作者引用2005 年的实验支持Gerstmann。在该实验中，实验群体大脑
特定区域被磁场刺激干扰，他们手指控制能力和数字配对能力（Facility）的受到损害。 
 
1.  答案：C 
 
解析：高亮部分出现在二句but 之后，由文章结构和句义理解可知C 最准确。 


 
 
 
2.  答案：D 
 
解析：由文章结构分析，可知D 最准确体现作者目的。 
 
Passage 139 
 
文章解析：文章是典型的观点论证结构。首句是作者观点：分析美国印第安人在政府岗位的
比例重要。之后是层次清楚的几个理由：First, 政府岗位比例反映人口结构重要，能维护传
统上弱势的印第安群体的政策利益。Second, 政府岗位还能提供经济利益。Third,  了解比
例很重要。文章最后是作者引用Peterson and Duncan 的观点。 
 
1.  答案：D 
 
解析：D 最准确反映文章结构，首句的Analyzing….可理解为对特定社会研究的倡导。E 不准
确。文章的重点不是倡导某种社会政策，而是对社会现象的研究。 
 
2.  答案：C 
 
解析：高亮句在文章最后，由文章结构可知是Peterson and Duncan 指出的某种社会趋势可
能反映的意义。C 相对最准确，projection 可理解为推测，推测社会趋势的意义。 
 
A 文章最后一句和前句是并列关系，不是解释关系。 
 
B 文章最后一句是观点，不是evidence. 
 
D discrepancy 文章没有体现 
 
E 参见A 选项对最后两句关系的分析。 
 
3.  答案：C 
 
解析：由文章Second 句体现的经济好处可知C 选项，在Fist 句提到的policy interests 之外
（apart from）还有其他好处。 
 
Passage 140 
 
文章解析：文章首句指出现象：attine ants 利用fungus 的现象。二句提出对该现象的常规
理解；蚂蚁控制菌类。三句But 后作者提出质疑，菌类也可能处于主导地位。 
 
1.  答案：A 
 
解析：题目问文章指出的支持蚂蚁控制菌类的证据。A 选项依据二句：Because the ants play 
the behaviorally active role。 


 
 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：manipulate 的意思是控制，这个地方表达的意思是形成一些复杂的机理去控制一些行
为，这个控制就是去支配，去战胜，所以E 选项最为合适。 
 
Passage 141 
 
文章解析：文章首段陈述一个问题：理论家和大型计算机气候模型都不能预测云系统对气候
变暖的作用。不同的研究之间结论不一致。第二段进一步通过一个包括十四个模型的研究细
述问题，并没有给出解决方案。 
 
1.  答案：B 
 
解析：文章首句可以看作statement, 后文都是细述、支持该陈述。A 选项theory 不准确，
theory 通常有一个明确观点。C 文章没有new information 。D 文章无预测。E 文章有对
比，但是对研究结果的对比，不是对观点的对比。 
 
2.  答案：C 
 
解析：本体是一个推断题，首先需要明确本题的意思：文章中描述的14 种模型的结果不一
致的原因是？ 
 
由第二段2、3 句可知，当不包括云时，模型的结果都是一致的，但是当加入云层后，这些
模型的结果就会变得乱七八糟，可知，模型结果不一致是由于云导致的，同时注意到在第一
段中，提出不同的云作用不一样，综上，所以本题选C。（它们基于关于云系影响气候的不
同假设） 
 
A 选项错，它们没有考虑云系影响气候的最新信息，无中生有； 
 
B 选项错，它们依据的是错误的信息而不是影响气候的云系的信息，无中生有； 
 
D 选项错，模型设计者对模型应该提供的预测种类存在不同意见，无中生有； 
 
E 选项错，模型设计者对于在模型中考虑云系之外的其他因素存在不同意见，无中生有or 逻
辑错误，是云系的不同才导致了模型结果的不同，而不是其他因素。 
 
3.  答案：A 
 
解析：A 选项依据首段：some studies suggested that…..On the other hand……矛盾的关键是
考虑的云的种类理解不同。要想取得一致预测，首先就要取得对云的种类考虑的一致。 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 142 
 
文章解析：文章介绍以Herbert Shaw 为代表的理论家对当代地质理论的质疑。文章开头指
出该质疑：地球内部能量是否足够推动版块运动。之后文章以Herbert Shaw 为质疑派代表，
认为要考虑天外能量影响。作者对比Herbert Shaw 和正统地质理论：大部分地质学家认为
天外因素是分开独立的，Herbert Shaw 认为天外因素不可分割。作者进而指出现代版块理论
的背景基础：Newton。 
 
1.  答案：D 
 
解析：D 最准确，explanation 可理解为Herbert  Shaw 对版块运动原因的解释。Theoretical 
context 可理解为十九世纪的古典地质学，牛顿的思想。 
 
A 选项偏向后半段，无法概括Herbert Shaw 的观点。 
 
B 选项核心概念extraterrestrial impactors 偏。 
 
C 选项dubious evidence 文章无依据。 
 
E 选项偏向前半段，无法概括之后的讨论。 
 
2.  答案：E 
 
解析：根据关键词定位，可知上下文强调Herbert Shaw 和传统观点的对比。 
 
3.  答案：C 
 
解析：C 选项依据文章后半段。现代版块理论，象古典地质学一样，借用牛顿的前提假设。 
 
Passage 143 
 
文章解析：文章开头指出问题：人的因素在Holocene 期的影响难于处理，因为气候和人为
因素难于分开。黑体句是作者对前文的否定，作者人为人的影响小，主要还是自然气候因素。 
 
1.  答案：E 
 
解析：根据文章结构分析，可知E 最准确。作者说人的影响小，等于降低之前讨论问题的复
杂性。 
 
2.  答案：B 
 
解析：B 选项依据文章中段提到的例子。 
 
 


 
 
Passage 144 
 
文章解析：文章介绍Meggers 的观点：土壤环境决定史前农业社会的规模，亚马逊地区因
为土壤贫瘠不可能支持大规模族群。即使加上鱼和乌龟资源，河边村落也不可能达到上万的
人口。Omagua 的观念支持Meggers 的观点。 
 
1.  答案：A 
 
解析：前句是M 对于亚马逊地区的论断，本句是关于农业与环境的一般性论断，为前句提
供一般性理论支持。 
 
2.  答案：D 
 
解析：D 选项定位Meggers accepted that fish and turtle resources of the Amazon made 
possible the long riverside villages……Omagula 属于riverside villages. 
 
Passage 145 
 
文章解析：文章是关于blenny 选巢倾向的研究报告。文章开始介绍选巢的两种因素，石头
的大小和巢的方向。巢的东南朝向比石头大小更能解释卵的多少。水流速度不是选择巢的朝
向的原因，因此朝向本身更是择巢原因，尽管背后的原因不清楚。 
 
1.  答案：B 
 
解析：由文章结构分析，两种因素中，朝向更是择巢的重要因素，可知B 选项。 
 
C 选项nest size 概念不准确.即使理解为stone size, 文章说，卵的多少不能被巢所在石头
completely explained , 并没有完全否认stone size 的因素。 
 
2.  答案：C 
 
解析：在文章所述最近的研究中，朝东南的巢和其他朝向的巢的水流是一样的，可知水流不
是朝向的关键因素。 
 
Passage 146 
 
文章解析：文章是作者对于editors 传记起源于浪漫主义时期观点的驳论。Editors 的观点
是：传记起源于浪漫主义时期。但作者指出起源的过程是缺失的。作者进而指出，传记同样
可以被认为是起源于前浪漫主义的 scandalous memoirs. 
 
1.  答案：A 
 
解析：由文章结构分析可知，作者指出scandalous memoirs 是表明传记起源的替代性来源。 
 


 
 
2.  答案：C 
 
解析：由关键词“attained great significance”定位到末句“became an object of major 
ideological significance”,C选项“widespread”是“sheer ubiquity”的同义改写.末句“It”
指代前句“The Romantic period”。 
 
Passage 147 
 
文章解析：文章关于S 回巢现象的解释分析。文章首先指出关于回巢的一个现象：距离越
长，回巢成功率越低。提出两种可能解释：1 能力问题，距离太远，没有能力回。作者在第
一个However 句否定了该解释。2 是否值得问题，能量消耗和卵被捕食与回巢成功孵化之
间权衡利弊得失。作者在第二个However 句指出，有大窝卵的S 在长距离回巢率更高（支
持了解释2,大窝卵更值得消耗能量回巢）。 
 
1.  答案：B 
 
解析：B 是对文章结构的最准切概括。D 选项只概括了后半段。 
 
2.  答案：D 
 
解析：高亮句在第一个However 转折，题目问暗含的假设。作者在该句指出，在每个距离
上都有S 个体成功回巢。作者用此证据否定第一种解释：太远没有能力回巢。D 选项取非，
成功回巢的个体比其他个体有更强的回巢能力，等于说其他个体没有回巢能力，就不能否认
第一种解释：没有能力回巢。 
 
3.  答案：A 
 
解析：题目问第二种解释对于远距离没有回巢的S 暗含的观点。第二种解释认为是“是否值
得的问题”，引用有大窝卵的S 回巢率更高的证据作为支持，认为有大窝卵更值得回来，暗
含的逆否命题观点就是：不值得回来的是因为有小窝卵。A 选项由此推理可得。 
 
Passage 148 
 
文章解析：文章是对于作者Elizabeth Gaskell 的作品Mary Barton 的介绍加评论。首段引入
Mary Barton：关于1840 年代英国产业工人的遭遇。作品关于工人阶级的日常生活，带有
documentary 性质。首段末句是对documentary 性质的大正小负的概括评价。 
 
二段开头指出作品一个不足：局外观察纪录者的视角。但之后转为正评价：genuine 
imaginative, convincing. 二段末句又是一个大正小负的概括评价。 
 
三段开头介绍作品一个章节（Old Alice’s History ）所表现的从乡村转变为都市工人的痛苦
经历。段末提到工人合作的传统。 
 
1.  答案：B 


 
 
 
解析：题目问哪个选项能体现从末段例子中概括出的工业化经历。B 选项依据原文末段首句：
workers brought from the villages and the countryside to the urban industrial centers. 末段
提到的几个人物的例子也都体现了这一特点。 
 
2.  答案：E 
 
解析：本题是典型正改善题。首先找到文章作者对Mary Barton 的负评价：二段开头：As a 
member of the middle class, Gaskell could hardly help approaching working-class life as an 
outside observer and a reporter。取非后可得E 选项。 
 
3.  答案：C 
 
解析：由关键词documentary record 定位到首段。首段末句是文章作者大正小负的评价。C
选项，“有保留的赞许”体现最准确。 
 
4.  答案：D 
 
解析：类比题。由人名Job Leigh 定位到第三段。由段落两处提到的Job Leigh 可概括出与
D 选项类似的特点：人在工业都市中，迷恋于与身处环境不协调的乡村事物。 
 
Passage 149 
 
文章解析：首段开头指出问题：机动车快速增加，很多美国城市污染物超标。随后，作者指
出相对可行解决方案：天然气等替代性燃料。 
 
二段首先指出替代性燃料的优点：更小更简单的分子，更少碳碳组合键，释放的碳氢物质更
少生成臭氧。作者通过对比，指出传统燃料的缺点：更大分子，更易不充分燃烧，更易产生
未燃烧的光化学性能活跃的碳氢化合物。On the other hand 之后，作者指出替代性燃料的
缺点。 
 
三段特地讨论乙醇（Ethanol）和甲醇（Methanol）。相对其他替代燃料，乙醇甲醇有优点：
单位能效更高，需要较少改进现有燃料供给系统。但也有缺点：乙醇比甲醇更贵。甲醇另外
的优点：大量减少导致臭氧的释放。 
 
四段是作者对替代性燃料的辩护。针对替代性燃料能效低的批评，作者认为，有效的设计能
弥补缺点。 
 
1.  答案：B 
 
解析：题目问的是汽油的缺点，优先定位到第二段。根据关键词“incomplete combustion”
定位可得B 选项。involves an intricate series of reactions 是原文involves a more complex 
series of reactions 的同义改写。 
 


 
 
2.  答案：C 
 
解析：概括首句描述的问题可得：单位排放减少，但总量增长太快，导致总排放增加。C 选
项最体现该矛盾。 
 
3.  答案：E 
 
解析：根据关键词“designed to use methanol”优先定位到第四段。四段先承认使用
methanol 能效低。转折之后说，为methanol 设计的车辆使用更少燃料，减少都市空气污
染，可知是能效提高了。E 是说能效提高了。 
 
4.  答案：A 
 
解析：题干没有可定位信息，只能用选项定位。A 选项可依据首段：There is a growing 
realization that the only effective way to achieve further reductions in vehicle emissions……只
能采用替代性燃料，说明传统燃料没有提高空间了。 
 
Passage 150 
 
文章解析：文章首句引入主题，关于Alice Walker’s The Color Purple 的评论：评论界的负
评价，希望成为现实主义，但各种非现实主义的因素违反现实主义传统。 
 
二段首句带有总结递进性质：The Color Purple 是否本质上就不想成为现实主义。Gates 认
为，The Color Purple 中与上帝书信交流的设计来自黑人文学传统。 
 
三段是文章作者对Gates 评论观点的批评。作者认为Gates 对The Color Purple 的评论不准
确：忽略The Color Purple 的传统结构，过去关注书信本身，忽略书信的环境。作者认为：
需要evaluative paradigm 来表明The Color Purple 的故意的反传统意图。 
 
1.  答案：B 
 
解析：题干所说的细节出现在第一段。作者在第二段就提出包括这些细节在内的因素说明
The Color Purple 是否本质上就不想成为现实主义的问题。在三段作者的评论中，作者进一
步明确The Color Purple 的反传统性质。B 选项的certain novelistic conventions 可理解为
Anglo-European 的现实主义小说传统。 
 
2.  答案：C 
 
解析：在第二段，在对Gates 的评论介绍中，可知美国黑人文学可能是The Color Purple 的
模仿对象。 
 
3.  答案：B 
 
解析：由关键词an evaluative paradigm 定位到第三段最后。由最后一句可知B 选项。 


 
 
 
4.  答案：E 
 
解析：题目问Gates 和首段提到的评论者的共同点。首段评论者注意到The Color Purple 的
非现实主义性质，二段Gates 认为它借鉴了美国黑人文学的因素，可知E 选项正确。 
 
Passage 151 
 
文章解析：首段开头是Oliver 的观点：布鲁斯难于转化成文字的诗歌。However 转折后，作
者认为，Hughes 成功地把布鲁斯转化为诗歌。 
 
二段首先介绍Hughes 认为重要的体裁区分：folk blues 和 classic blues. 传统评论家认为，
Hughes 成功转化的是classic blues, 他转化folk blues 不成功。 
 
三段是作者的评论。作者认为Hughes 的布鲁斯诗歌表现了folk blues 的精髓。作者借用
Arnold Rampersad 的观点：Hughes 的布鲁斯诗歌表达的是普通民众的声音。Young Gal’s 
Blues 是这方面的代表。Golden Brown Blues 则是机械模仿古典布鲁斯的反面代表。 
 
1.  答案：E 
 
解析：根据文章结构分析，作者在在三段反驳了二段介绍的传统评论家的观点。 
 
2.  答案：B 
 
解析：根据首段结构，结合句义理解，可知高亮句起到强调写作布鲁斯诗歌的作用。 
 
3.  答案：A 
 
根据引号内容，进行定位，然后能够知道：Young Gal’s Blue 更加倾向的是common folk；
而Golden Brown Blues 则是remote from the common，所以，可知，Young 的更加colloquial。
此题的难点在于选项中各个生词的认知。 
 
neglect = lacking 
 
4.  答案：B 
 
解析：由首段Hughes 解决的问题，二段体现的classic blues 的特点，可概括出相同点。 
 
Passage 152 
 
文章解析：首段通过对比引出问题现象；和19 世纪的其他几个革命相比，我们缺乏对1848
年2 月革命社会背景、动机、过程的了解。 
 
二段三段，作者对首段问题给出两种解释：1 被6 月革命所淡化。2 成功革命缺乏可靠历史


 
 
记录。 
 
1.  答案：D 
 
解析：D 选项可定位到二段第2 点解释。该解释强调，和失败革命相比，成功革命缺乏历史
记录，可知革命之间的历史纪录不同。 
 
2.   划线句子为Quite different is the outcome of 
 
successful insurrections like those of July 1830 and February 1848. 
 
答案选择B  
 
作者的结论是，像1830 年7 月和1848 年2 月这样的成功起义的结果是完全不同的。结合
前文理解，作者说失败的insurrection 会有详细的记录，但1830 和1848 这种成功的
insurrection 就不会有详细的记录。B 选项里讲，1830 的background and 
 
motivation have been identified，因此为正确答案。 
 
3.  答案：D 
 
解析：由文章结构，可知二段解释的是首段问题现象。 
 
4.  答案：E 
 
解析：作者首段提到 participant’s backgrounds, 二段又提到socioeconomic groups, 综合
可知，作者认为社会经济背景对于革命的理解重要。 
 
Passage 153 
 
文章解析：文章首段先介绍19 世纪对17 世纪荷兰绘画的传统评论观点：现实主义视角。
However 转折后引入最近的研究：象征主义视角。超现实主义的解读几成共识，但对超现实、
象征程度的理解仍是难题。 
 
二段借de Jongh 表达观点：评估多重性很困难。作者反对de Jongh 的跟随者对作品的纯粹
象征主义的处理。 
 
三段首先借用B 的观点：绘画会有单一象征意义之外的各种可能含义。作者反对对17 世纪
荷兰绘画的公式化简单化处理。 
 
1.  答案：D 
 
解析：根据文章结构，作者主要是在对最近的关于荷兰17 世纪绘画的研究做介绍和评论。 
 


 
 
2.  答案：D 
 
解析：定位到二段末。根据所在句可知D 选项。 
 
3.  答案：B 
 
解析：根据文章结构，作者在末段（第3 段），仍然在对最近的研究的简单象征主义倾向做
批评。caveat：警告，批评。 
 
4.  答案：E 
 
解析：根据首段开头，19 世纪艺术批评家对17 世纪荷兰绘画做现实主义理解。首段后半部
分，emblem books 被作为含有不能简单做表面理解（现实主义）的素材的来源。可知E 选
项。 
 
Passage 154 
 
文章解析：文章开头是老观点，18 世纪后期文化权威的共识：历史阅读比文学阅读地位更
高。之后，包括黑体句和likewise 句都是从作家塑造女主人公形象的角度支持老观点的例子：
喜欢历史的往往是正面主人公，喜欢文学的往往是负面形象。Yet句是文章作者的评论观点：
该问题比表面看起来的更复杂。之后是文章作者用来支持自己立场的理由：不喜欢历史的有
正面意义，喜欢历史也有负面作用。 
 
1.  答案：A 
 
解析：主旨目的题，考察文章结构。文章一开头给出一个观点（英国文化当局认为女性应该
多读历史，而不是小说），随后给出了一些证据来支持（文中高亮句即体现这点）。随后，作
者提出了反驳意见（认为对历史的喜好具有双向作用，喜欢历史不一定好），并给出解释说
明（例如，提出Hume 写的历史其实是有争议的）。A 选项符合本文结构。 
 
2.  答案：B 
 
解析：定位到该句：While Hume’s history was generally seen as being less objectionable 
than his philosophy, there were widespread doubts about his moral soundness even as a 
historian by the time that Hanway was writing。 从该句可知，Hume 的哲学被负评价，他的
历史也被负评价。 
 
3.  答案：D 
 
解析：根据文章结构分析，可知高亮句是支持文章首句的例子。首句和该句都体现的对历史
阅读的判断是：历史阅读地位更高。 
 
4.  答案：C 
 


 
 
解析：根据关键词可定位到该句：While Hume’s history was generally seen as being less 
objectionable than his philosophy, there were widespread doubts about his moral soundness 
even as a historian by the time that Hanway was writing。由前文Yet 转折前可知，Hanway 
把阅读Hume 历史当作正面形象塑造的手段。但该句中，Hume 的历史有负面评价。综合可
知，Hanway 没想到阅读Hume 的负面影响，否则不会当作正面塑造的手段。 
 
Passage 155 
 
文章解析：Columnist 的论证中，P 和V 两种同样功能的处方药品。P 的广告用更多的处方
数量当作P 更优秀（第一黑体句，P 广告的观点）的证据。It can be argued 之后是Columnist
的评论。第二黑体句是Columnist 的观点：P 广告的观点很荒谬，理由是：P 上市的时间比
V 更长（是时间长导致处方数量多，而不是质量更高）。 
 
答案：B 
 
解析：由结构分析可知，第一黑体句是P 广告的观点，也是Columnist 反对的观点。第二句
黑体句是Columnist 的核心观点。 
 
Passage 156 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：逻辑单题中出现句子作用题，最常见的考法就如本题所示，问你哪一句是结论，哪一
句是支持结论亦或是反对结论。 
 
本文在一开始就说到：有证据证明Garden of Eden 这幅作品是van Eyck 创作的。但是接下
来，出现了第一个高亮句说：尽管如此，这幅画也有可能是别人创作的。而后后面开始举例
说明，为什么这幅画很可能是别人的作品。 
 
由此，可知，第一个高亮句是main conclusion；而第二个高亮则是provide evidence insupport 
of that conclusion。答案选C。 
 
Passage 157 
 
答案：A 
 
本篇逻辑单词比较特殊，让我们根据原文提供的信息，选择一个最合适的结论。 
 
本文介绍了两种方法来研究relatedness of species，其中，传统的anatomy 的方法已经被
ascertained，而新的方法infer （未被证实 = is not borne out）… 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 158 
 
答案：B 
 
请注意，这道逻辑单词的突破口在于greater effect。特别是文中最后一句话提到：当把一大
部分zander 清除之后，剩下的zander 对本地的鱼造成的影响比之前更大。 
 
B 选项符合逻辑。清除的鱼，都是zander 的成年鱼，而成年zander 会吃年轻的zander，这
就使得之前的影响不会那么大。现在，成年的zander 去掉了，年经的zander 就没有了天
敌，吃得可不就比之前欢快了嘛。 
 
Passage 159 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：Langland 和Chaucer 的作品在结构和主题上都有很多相似之处。一些批评家认为，
在Middle English poetry 中，有相似成份的现象并不常见，所以，他们认为Chaucer 受到了
Langland 的Pier Plowman 的影响。 
 
题目要求我们选一个削弱的选项，那该选项能够说明Chaucer 不一定是受到了Piers 
Plowman 的影响，有可能是受到了其他作品的影响。所以选D。 
 
Passage 160 
 
答案：E 
 
原文给出argument:Sphinx 的face 不可能是pharaoh Khafre 的，因为…… 
 
现在需要我们选一个削弱，即是选一个能够支持Sphinx 的face 有可能是pharaohKhafre 
的。所以，排除下大雨的因素（因为文章已经说了这是不可能导致face 是pharaoh Khafre 
的原因），答案选E。 
 
Passage 161 
 
答案：D 
 
题目要求选一个能够解释：做过手术的病人得glaucoma-related blindness 的概率低（与没
做过手术的人相比。） 
 
文中已明确说明：滴眼药水和做手术是as effective as 的，那为啥滴眼药水的病人会有更高
的概率得glaucoma-relatedblindness（也即是做过手术的病人得glaucoma-related blindness
的概率低），因为滴眼药水的人坚持不下去，所以效果就不如做手术好了。 
 
 


 
 
Passage 162 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：timberline 是植物能够生长的最高的海拔。然后通过植物的化石表明，在比当前的
RockyMountain timberline 还高100 米。所以，推导出以前Rocky Mountain 的气温没有现
在低，所以才会生长出植物。但是，这其中，有一个漏洞，万一，这个植物是特别耐寒，耐
冻的植物呢？那显然，你再说以前的气温没有现在低，就是不符合逻辑的，所以，我们需要
假设的是C。 
 
Passage 163 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：cottongrass 是caribou 夏天的唯一蛋白质来源。如果caribou 在夏天不能获得足够多
的蛋白质的话，那么在第二年，它们就不能繁殖后代。而最近，随着平均气温的上升，cotton 
grass 开始消失了。所以，文章得到一个结论，if the warmingtrend continues, caribou 将要
灭绝。 
 
然后，逻辑结构就有一个漏洞了，如果气温的上升，使得出现一些新的植物，而这些植物能
够为caribou 提供足够的蛋白质，那它们仍然能够正常的繁殖。所以，要补充文章的逻辑，
选C。 
 
Passage 164 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：尽管Almaria 一年级学生中，阅读水平比较高的学生的比例在1995-2010 年期间没有
变化，但是同时期的学生中，阅读存在问题的学生的比例显著增加。表明一年级的学生的平
均阅读水平是在下降的。 
 
这其中，有一个很重要的逻辑，并没有说明，那就是schoolbooks 的难度，到底有没有变化，
如果schoolbooks 的难度越来越大，那就不能说明，一年级学生的阅读能力越来越差。所以，
我们需要补足这个逻辑，选D。 
 
Passage 165 
 
答案：B 
 
解析：Minoans 这个地方有很发达的制铜的工业（因为在这个地方发现了很多bronze 
implements and the furnaces 等制造铜的东西）。然后，又在southern Greece 发现了很多类
型于Minoans 这个地方生产的铜制品，所以，得出一个结论，Minoans 生产的铜制品不光自
己本国使用，还出口到southern Greece。 
 


 
 
这个逻辑最大的漏洞就在于：本文并没有说southern Greece 能不能生产，或者其它第三方
国家A，能不能生产。所以，原文的逻辑是不严谨的。所以，需要补足这个逻辑，选B。 
 
Passage 166 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：埃及的木乃伊保存普遍比其他地方的木乃伊更好。有两个原因：一是技术，二是埃及
当地干燥的气候。 
 
这道题重要的突破点在于，第二个原因中的插入语, “more likely”。所以，更有可能的是第
二个原因，而现在需要我们providethe most support，那我们的选项，就应该体现出是干燥
的问题，而不是技术的问题。 
 
选D。
（埃及古代的坟墓中保存的尸体和木乃伊中保存的一样好，说明这并不是技术的原因，
而有可能是第二个气候干燥的原因。） 
 
Passage 167 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：Colonia 的经济在过去的八年中，进入了衰退期。很多本该倒闭的公司都幸免于难，
因为他们员工的高效率帮助公司控制了成本。 
 
然而，在最近的几个月，Colonia 的经济开始复苏，公司也开始招人。因此，Colonia 将会遭
受到雇员平均工作效率的下降，因为_________。 
 
原来雇员的效率是很高的，现在由于雇员人数的增加，导致工作效率下降，那只能是新加入
的员工效率很低或者是没有原来老员工的效率高，所以才能把平均水平往下拉。所以，选C。 
 
Passage 168 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：最近出土的古代Carthagian 硬币都印有人的头像，同时在脸颊的地方会有mole。由
于，艺术家不会在generalized portrayal of face 上包含这种特殊的细节，所以，考古学家认
为，这些硬币应该是某个真实的个人，而不是一个idealized type。然后，这个结论是不合理
的，因为_______。 
 
我们现在需要说明的是，这个结论不合理，也就是需要我们说明，这些硬币上的图案就是
idealized type，那既然是idealized type，为什么这上面。又会有mole 呢？因为E。 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 169 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：人们普遍认为最早controlled use of fire 的是200，000 年前的Homo sapiens。然而，
最近发现了一个预计500，000 年前的遗址，包括：charcoal, burned animal bone, and charred 
rocks. 尽管，homo sapiens 在那个时间段还未出现，遗址上的这些发现，也不能说明
controlled use of fire 的时期早于Homo sapiens，因为_____。 
 
这道题，最大的逻辑漏洞就在于，我们没有办法确定500，000 年前，遗址上发现这个火，
是不是controlled use of fire。所以正好选E。 
 
Passage 170 
 
答案：B 
 
解析：因为有比较强的stylistic similarities，El Castillo 和Altamira 的洞穴壁画，被认为来自
同一个时期。然而，最近的颜料分析表明Altamira paintings 是迄今为止最老的作品。尽管
如此，这个案列也不能证明，stylistic similarities 不是一个靠谱的指标。因为_______。 
 
因为，stylistic similarities 还是可以用来进行closeness 的分类的，所以选B。 
 
Passage 171 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：San 这个地方的人相比于典型的工业社会的人，他们吃更多的水果、蔬菜和低盐的食
物。同时，他们中得高血压和肥胖症的概率要远远低于工业社会的人。然而，如果工业社会
的人也遵循相同的diet，他们获得高血压和肥胖症的几率并不会显著性地降低，因为______。
两个地方的人都采取了相同的diet，但是产生的结果还是截然不同，只能说明是个体差异了
（体格，基因）。选D。 
 
Passage 172 
 
1. 答案：倒数第二句。 
 
解析：这个题注意问的是“author”，也就是文章里面的“I”，只有最后两句才是说的作者
的结论，然后注意倒数第二句直接得出结论，最后一句是用例子加强结论，所以作者对
particular approach taken by Minoan archaeologists 的反对主要是用倒数第二句来体现。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：Schoep 的观点是紧接在hose functions has been called into questions 之后的，Schoep
认为Palace 是用来描述有地位的人的而不是功能，作者在文章里面也是反对function 的，


 
 
所以D 选项中的without being committed to the term’s functional implications 是非常符
合作者和Schoep 的观点的。A 选项没有提到function，错。B 选项和A 选项同理，错。C 选
项虽然提到了function，但是和作者的观点是相反的。E 选项hierarchical social structure 是
Schoep 的观点，作者并没有反对Schoep，所以E 也是错误的。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：作者的观点是最后两句话，所以此题要从最后两句话里面去寻找答案，可以看到E 选
项和文章中refer to a group of buildings that share a set of formal elements 是同义改写，所
以E 选项正确。A 选项convention 文章没有提到，A 错。B 选项中replaced by a more neutral 
term 是错误的，因为作者是比较认可Schoep 的more neutral term，但是作者认为自己的想
法才是对的，所以不存在replaced。C 选项明显错，文章就是在说以前对于Palace 的用法是
错误的。D 选项也是明显错的，这个问题用文章原话is widely used and deeply ingrained，
所以肯定不是recently become popular 的。 
 
4. 【新增题目】答案：A 
 
解析：本题问作者本人的观点，可以定位到最后一句，作者认为refer to a group of buildings 
that share a set of formal elements，可以对应A 选项。 
 
5. 【新增题目】答案：ABC 
 
解析：本题虽然是一个多选题，但是难度不高。ABC 均正确。其中，A 对应第一句；B 对应
第五句；C 对应第二句。 
 
6. 【新增题目】答案：B 
 
解析：信息目的题，考查句间句内关系，高亮句就是在举一个例子说明each of those functions 
has been called into questions，对应B 选项。 
 
Passage 173 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：第二段第一句先是提出了一个观点，从howerver 开始这个观点被反驳了，thus 继续
解释反驳内容。所以符合这个结构的明显是B 选项。 
 
2. 答案：C【划线句子是Dryandra has not been free of these changes, but the impact may 
have been less or more recent with the result that Dryandra may retain a more natural or 
complete bird diversity relative to the Tablelands.】 
 
解析：这句话是和上一句中描述的现象有关系的，做了一个进一步说明的作用，所以答案选
C 选项比较合适。 
 


 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：原文中not revealed by casual observation 说明canopy complexity 不是随便被观察到
的，对应选项中的D 选项are not always obvious。A 选项完全是无中生有。B 选项也是无中
生有，文章并没有提到这个关系。C 选项依然是无中生有。E 选项也是文章没有提到的内容。 
 
4. 答案：E 
 
解析：文章最后一句说到Dryandra may retain a more natural or complete bird diversity 
relative to the Tablelands，其中关键词natural，注意introduced foxes and feral cats 不是
natural 的，所以它们对于D 的影响比T 更小，所以E 选项是正确的。 
 
Passage 174 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：what many people believe 指的是前面的现象：小孩需要接种天花疫苗。文章最后一
句的观点是所有年龄段的人都需要接种天花疫苗。所以必须要找出表明现在的成人身上已
经没有天花抗体的选项。所以答案选D 选项，因为如果天花疫苗的效果在20 年之后会消失
的话，那就意味着现在的成年人身上没有天花的抗体了，所以需要接种新的天花疫苗。 
 
Passage175 
 
1. 答案：Women harvest cactus for their families to eat.（第四句） 
 
解析：很明显只有这句话说到了prickly pear 对于人类饮食的影响。注意Male herders work 
cactus as a vegetable crop for cattle.这句话说的是对牛的影响，不符合题意。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：A 选项说得过于绝对了，文章只说现在不需要通过游牧的方式来帮助cattle 度过旱季，
但不是完全不需要帮助cattle 了，其实还是需要把仙人掌转化成液体补充给cattle。B 选项
也说得太绝对了，文章并没有说这些人完全放弃游牧生活，而且题目里面还用到了
pastoralists 这个词。C 选项是对的，是文章最后一句话的同义改写。 
 
Passage 176 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：定位到文章“because she believes such works have been unjustifiably neglected by 
unsympathetic scholars”这句话，所以直接从选项中找到这句话的同义改写即可。所以答案
是D 选项，unrecognized=neglected。 
 
2. 答案：C 


 
 
 
解析：Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women 是在第一段中被提到的，而文章的第一段是在呈
现Stimpson 的观点，所以引出Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women 的目的一定也是要表达
Stimpson 的某个观点的，所以先排除AB 选项，因为文章并没有体现作者的观点。C 选项符
合文章结构。D 选项明显错误的，因为Stimpson 和Barnes 的观点是不一致的。E 选项中的
ambiguous 也是第二段才提到的，所以不可能是引出Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women 的
目的。 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：这个题定位到文章的最后一句话，定位到关键词“ambiguity”，这个词说明Stimpson
在定义goodness 和love 的时候并不清晰，包括前文Stimpson never actually defines ‘love,’
也能说明这一点，所以D 选项的描述是符合文章的。 
 
Passage 177 
 
1. 答案：AB 
 
解析：A 选项是improving their muscular efficiency 的同义改写，B 选项是swim with bursts 
of speed 的同义改写，C 选项并不是maintaining an internal body temperature above that 
of surrounding waters 的作用，排除。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：这个题关键词其实是oscillatory，这个词体现的是摆动，并没有带攻击的意思，就是
普通的游上游下而已，所以答案选A 最合适。 
 
Passage 178 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：这篇文章的最后一段是对文章的总结，所以最后一段的第一句可以看出这篇文章的主
要目的，是在评估primordialists 和modernists 这两种说法各自的问题，所以答案选A 选项。 
 
2. 答案：第三段第三句 
 
解析：题目要求我们在第三段中，找一句话来支持younger Koreanists 关于Korean nation
的观点。由第二段可知, younger Koreanists 认为nation 是一个新词，是现代的产物。所以，
第三段第三句能够支持这一观点。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：从文章第一段能够得知这两人对于国家的理解中a strictly modern phenomenon 这一
点，然后文章最后一段中“On the other hand, the inhabitants of the Korean peninsula had 


 
 
a much longer history —well over one thousand years—as a unified political collectivity than 
did the peoples studied by Gellner and Anderson.”这句话明显是在说这俩人的调查不严谨，
所以答案选B 选项最合适。 
 
4. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章提到欧洲，拉丁美洲，东南亚是在文章第一段说Gellner 和Anderson 的观点的
时候，那个地方说这些地区和韩国一样，都是“modern phenomenon”，“common sense 
of identity”，所以不同的地方必须要出现在反驳那俩人的观点的地方，所以定位到“On the 
other hand, the inhabitants of the Korean peninsula had a much longer history —well over 
one thousand years—as a unified political collectivity than did the peoples studied by Gellner 
and Anderson.”提取关键信息“much longer history as a unified political collectivity”，所
以答案选C 选项。 
 
5. 【新增题目】答案：D 
 
解析：
（本题高亮句为第二段倒数第二句）。本题与第三题有重合，都是体现本文作者的观点：
The positions of both groups seem problematic.本题选D。 
 
Passage 179 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：要证明Domesticated varieties of C.chinense 是由人类引进岛屿，也就是要证明不是
由鸟类引进的，所以A选项符合逻辑。如果鸟类无法吞住Domesticated varieties of C.chinense
的话，那么只能是人类才能把这个品种带到岛屿上去。 
 
Passage 180 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章的最后一句话表明WB 这个地方的陶瓷比正常家庭使用要多，所以能推出这里的
陶瓷有一些是用来进行交易的，所以也就是证明了文章的第一句和第二句话，所以答案选D
选项，WB 这个地方并不是消费陶瓷的地方，而是生产陶瓷由于交易的地方。这个题C 选项
有干扰性，注意WB 这个地方并不是agricultural surpluses，而是pottery surpluses。 
 
2. 答案：D 
解析：文章第一句话说生产陶瓷是为了弥补耕地不足的， 所以第二句的agricultural 
marginality 其实就是耕地不足的同义改写，所以marginality=deficiency。 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage181 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：根据文章的第一句就可以推出答案，文章第一句说尽管Klezmer 来自于很多不同的音
乐传统，但是Roma(Gypsy), Greek, and Romanian 却变成主导了，所以Klezmer 也一定受到
了Roma(Gypsy), Greek, and Romanian 的影响，不然的话这里的让步的意思就有问题。所以
这个题答案选B。A 选项无法从文章推出，C 选项通过第一句可以推知和文章描述是相反的，
D 选项和E 选项都无法从文章中推出。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
解析：通过文章第一句话就可以推出来，文章先是承认了diverse 的传统都影响了k，然后
后面三个东西影响是最强烈的，说明首先承认了k 确实受到很多other than 那三个东西以
外的东西的影响。 
 
Passage182 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：题目的推理是空气的灰尘多阻挡阳光直射，然后导致气温下降，然后延长冰河时期。
所以削弱选项必须要体现灰尘并不会导致气温的下降。A 选项正确，因为如果灰尘能够防止
地球上的热量逃离的话，那就说明灰尘能够帮助地球增加温度，所以对题目的推理起到了削
弱作用。B 选项错误，题目研究的就是ice age 时候的灰尘的影响，选项说的是两次ice age
之间的时候，起不到削弱作用。C 选项也错误，火山爆发是除了灰尘之外的其他因素。D 选
项错误，D 选项和B 选项犯了同样的错误，研究时期的不同对题目起不到削弱作用。E 选项
错误，E 选项其实加强了文章的结论，因为阳光是主要热源，所以灰尘就是会导致温度下降
了。 
 
Passage183 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：contrarians 认为任何最近的变暖都可能是自然的而不是人为的，所以我们在ABC 选
项中找等价的信息就行了。A 选项错误，因为并不是在讨论人为还是自然这个问题。B 选项
错误，错误原因和A 选项完全一致。C 选项正确，C 选项这句话其实就是contrarians 后面
的claim 的同义改写。 
 
2. 答案：AC 
 
解析：A 选项正确，根据companied 可以看出1910s 和1920s 和1940s 的warming 是有关
系的。B 选项也错误，1990s 其实也没有确定1940s 的变暖原因。C 选项正确，原文原句
However, no one believes enough greenhouse gases had reached the atmosphere by then 
to cause much of a human-induced warming 就说明我们无法确定是否这次变暖是不是由人


 
 
类产生的温室气体引起的。 
 
Passage184 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：注意文章举了两个例子，一个是oral tale 一个是chemist，两句话用just as 连接，表
示两个例子的功能相似。然后注意后面一句话“This instance on private rather than collective 
ownership, derived from the nineteenth-century notion of the autonomous, creative, 
authorial voice, flies in the face of those who come from an oral tradition.”这句话中的this 
instance 就是上面的两个例子，所以这两个例子的功能就是把collective ownership 变成了
private，所以正确答案选A 选项。 
 
2. D 
 
解析：这个题非常简单，整篇文章都是在说到底authorship 属于个人还是属于集体，所以描
述这种关系的选项是D 选项。 
 
3. C 
 
解析：此题对应到文章这句话“This instance on private rather than collective ownership, 
derived from the nineteenth-century notion of the autonomous, creative, authorial voice, flies 
in the face of those who come from an oral tradition.”，所以在选项中和此句话同义改写的
是C 选项。 
 
Passage185 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：文章的推论是乘客坐出租车系好安全带能够使得车祸中受伤人数不高于其他车的车
祸受伤人数，所以我们要找的选项必须是使得出租车车祸受伤人数多于其他车的。A 选项错
误，连出租车都没有提到。B 选项错，发生事故多和平均受伤人数是完全两个概念。C 选项
也错，错误原因和B 选项类似，车辆多和平均受伤人数没有关系。D 选项正确，如果出租车
平均乘客比其他车多，这就很可能导致平均受伤人数多。E 选项也错，我们需要的结论是出
租车平均受伤人数多，E 选项也不能实现这个目的。 
 
Passage 186 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章的大致意思是：葡萄在温室的高温和高二氧化碳的环境中长得好，vineyard 不容
易提供温室高温环境，但是可以提供高二氧化碳的环境，所以葡萄的产量也会上升。那么削
弱的选项必须是尽管在高二氧化碳中，但是葡萄的产量可能不会上升，甚至可能会下降。A
选项是正确答案，A 选项说在温室生长的时候，容易控制害虫，现在没有了温室，所以害虫


 
 
可能导致葡萄产量的下降。B 选项没有提到葡萄产量的下降，所以错误。C 选项偷换概念，
葡萄的产量和葡萄的质量是不一样的概念。D 选项和C 选项错误原因很接近，都是偷换概
念，没有提高葡萄产量这个要素。E 选项属于偏加强的作用，温度上升之后有利于葡萄的产
量上升。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：C 
 
解析：原文提出随着温度的升高，葡萄的产量会增加，我们要想确保这一结论，那我们需要
回答的问题就是C 选项，温度升高是否会对葡萄造成损害，从而影响产量。一旦这个问题得
到解答，那么我们就能确定这一结论的正确性。 
 
Passage 187 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：对应的是Indeed, Newhall's work bears her unmistakable imprint。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：定位到“Does this photographic essay achieve results impossible in other media?”，
这句话说明Newhall 只相信在摄影中存在。所以答案选E 选项。 
 
Passage 188 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：此题的逻辑推理是蜘蛛的捕食者能够去区分蜘蛛变色，所以蜘蛛的变色对于蜘蛛的生
存不太可能有什么好处。题目要让我们选一个能够评估这个推理的选项。A 选项错误，因为
A 选项没有提到蜘蛛的变色对于生存的影响。B 选项错，蜘蛛的自然颜色也不影响它的生存。
C 选项是正确答案，因为C 选项提到了蜘蛛的变色和生存之间的关系，如果蜘蛛变色能够让
蜘蛛捕食猎物有帮助的话，那就符合问题的要求。D 选项也错，文章捕食在研究蜘蛛变色和
花的关系。E 选项错，文章没有研究其他动物的变色。 
 
Passage189 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：此题相对比较简单，定位到文章最后一句话，从since 开始直接解释了原因“the 
garment unions welcomed women workers of every skill level”，所以C 选项是正确答案。 
 
Passage190 
 
1. 答案：E 
 


 
 
解析：本文主要是改正了之前的一个错误观点：美国黑人的newspapers 对于美国的民权运
动的影响小。从文章的分析来看，实际上美国黑人的newspapers 对于美国民权运动有见解
的推动作用，所以答案选E 选项。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：此题对应到文章的这句话“using a compelling form of advocacy journalism rather 
than the standard objective newspaper style, allowed those who in the 1950s began pushing 
nationally for equality to start at a far higher level”。直接从选项中找同义改写，所以对应
到D 选项。 
 
Passage191 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：这篇文章主要是在说人类的一些习惯导致了我们一直会和文字共存，即便我们不喜欢
和蚊子生活在一起。所以最准确的答案是C选项：arguing that social traditions can perpetuate 
people's problems with mosquitoes. 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：这边文章先是提出了一个言论：人类不能消灭蚊子。然后列举了一些理由告诉我们为
什么人类不能消灭蚊子。最后再一次强调之前的言论，所以正确的文章结构应该是C 选项。 
 
3. 答案：第二段第一句。 
 
解析：题目问这篇文章可能对作者的立场的一个误解。文章只有第二段第一句作者在澄清自
己的立场，也就是提出了读者可能对他的误解。 
 
Passage192 
 
答案：B 
 
解析：用了BPA 的老鼠的后代比没有用BPA 的老鼠的后代要大10%，所以推出BPA 对于老
鼠的体型有影响。假设是B 选项，即两组老鼠在做实验之前体型没有区别，如果在做实验前
老鼠体型本来就有差异的话，那么就削弱了这个实验的结果了。取否之后对推论有削弱，符
合文章的假设。 
 
Passage 193 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：定位到文章“During the wolf-free era, heavy browsing of aspen trees by elk 
populations spelled doom not only for trees themselves but for a host of other creatures 


 
 
dependent on them, such as beavers”，其中最后的such as beavers 就说明elk populations
对于beavers 有着非常大的负面影响。所以符合这样的意思的是B 选项。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：定位文章“When wolves returned, grazers and browsers resumed normal patterns of 
behaviors, preferring safer, open areas over the dense cover and streamsides where 
carnivores can lurk. Keeping elk wary”。意思是狼回归之后，elk 等动物就更喜欢安全开放
的区域，不太喜欢streamsides，因为那里有肉食动物。所以符合这个描述的是B 选项。 
 
Passage 194 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：A 选项错误，文章只描述了sit-and-wait invertebrate predators，没有描述其他的
predators，所以A 选项属于推测。B 选项错误，文章并没有说为什么在营养组成上要有区
别。C 选项错误，dry mass 只是wolf spider 那里举的例子，不代表所有。D 选项是正确的，
文章最后一句话就是在描述这个内容，和D 选项是等价的。E 选项也是文章没有说到的，只
能推测。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章先是提出了一个传统的观点，然后后面反驳了这个观点，最后再用了一些证据去
支持反驳的理由。符合这个文章结构的是C 选项。 
 
Passage 195 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：定位到文章“In contrast, upon detecting a chimpanzee, male Diana monkeys do not 
vocalize at all, while females give only a few quiet alarm calls and flee quickly to hide in the 
forest canopy”，意思是雄性猴子不会发出声音，雌性猴子会发出很小的声音，所以答案选
A 选项。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：定位到文章“function both to warn others and to signal to the predator that it has 
been detected. ”，所以答案选E 选项。 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：这个题回忆不完整，算一个费题处理就行，感觉选项都不太合理。 
 
 


 
 
Passage 196 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：此题定位到“But the solutions that Matisse arrives at are always idiosyncratic and tend 
to be unrelated to any system of ideas.”，因为Matisse 和Braque’s cubism 是相反特征，
所以可以推出Braque’s cubism 的特征就是system of ideas，所以正确答案是A 选项。 
 
2. 答案：AB 
 
解析：题目定位到这句话“But the solutions that Matisse arrives at are always idiosyncratic 
and tend to be unrelated to any system of ideas.”通过idiosyncratic 推出Matisse 的
unconventional 的特征，所以A 选项是对的。unrelated to any system of ideas 则说明B 选
项是对的。 
 
Passage 197 
 
注意：文章Yet those who subsist by hunting wild animals and gathering wild issue of what 
constitutes “wild”这句话应该有一些内容在回忆机经的时候被遗漏了，但是不影响这两个
题的作答。 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章第一句话“Attempts to identify New Guinea’s hunter-gatherers face the well-
known difficulty of defining what constitutes a hunter-gatherer group.”就表明了这边文章
的主要目的，就是定义New Guinea’s hunter-gatherers 有困难，所以答案选B 选项。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：这里的common 就是指的“普遍的”，所以E 选项conventional 最接近这个意思。 
 
Passage 198 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：此题需要定位到文章这一句话“it was not surprising that some literary scholars in the 
early 1960s evaded the important issue of women’s sexual identity entirely”，所以这些学
者做的事情就是回避了女性的性别身份的问题，所以在选项中最贴近的是C 选项。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：定位到文章这一句话“These histories excluded the minor novelists, who are the links 
in the chain that binds literary generations together”。句中的these histories 指的就是Great 
Traditionalism 那一段时期的历史。这段历史主要就是忽略了和其他小说家之间的关系，所


 
 
以答案选C 选项最合理。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 
解析：定位到“Such an approach, while insightful and very valuable, did not consider the 
crucial connections between women’s writing and changes in their legal and economic 
status.”其中such an approach 指的就是some literary scholars in the early 1960s 的立场，
所以比较等价的评价是C 选项：respectful but critical。就是先承认它好的地方，然后再说不
好的地方。 
 
Passage 199 
 
答案：E 
 
解析：文章的推理是说像木星这样大小的行星形成的时候，它的轨道一定比地球绕太阳的轨
道要长。然后问下面哪个选项能够提供支持，尽管发现了一些例外的情况。A 选项是无关选
项。B 选项也不能支持推理，排除。C 选项说的是地球，题目需要说的是像木星一样大小的
行星。D 选项没有提到行星轨道，也排除。E 选项是正确答案，因为如果行星老了之后就会
离母恒星更近，那就能够支持行星刚产生的时候轨道比较大的这个说法。 
 
Passage 200 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章定位到这句话“the colonies benefit from rearing workers of a range of sizes.”，
很明显答案对应的是D 选项，benefit from=advantageous。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章说成年蜜蜂determine 幼蜂的体型，再结合前面一句话“In pollen storing species 
larvae develop in individual nest cells and are fed directly by adults.”能够推出这里是说成年
蜜蜂能够控制幼虫的体型，所以答案选C 选项，determine=control。 
 
Passage 201 
 
1. 定位到，But Windes recently challenged this view by pointing out the paucity of ( 
 
少量的)…，可知E 选项正确。 
 
A 选项错，irrelevant to the examination 无中生有 
 
B、C 选项错，crucial evidence 无中生有 
 
D 选项错，a false notion about the significance 无中生有 


 
 
 
2. 定位到which revealed only 3 upper-story hearths, in contrast to 59 ground-floor hearths: 
habituation rooms would have required hearths for cooking and heat. 
 
可知C 选项正确。 
 
A 选项错，storage areas 无中生有 
 
B 选项错，remodeled 无中生有 
 
D 选项错，Early excavation of …disturbed 
 
E 选项错，文中并无此比较关系。 
 
3. 定位到倒数第二句。especially given Judd’s disinclination to destroy later structures and 
features to expose earlier ones. 
 
可知A 选项正确。 
 
B、C 选项错，无中生有 
 
D 选项错，resulted in 因果关系无中生有 
 
E 选项错，confirmed traditional population estimates 无中生有 
 
Passage 202 
 
1. 定位到最后一句。 
 
two northern outlier populations were also discovered，而C 选项说，最近才migrated to the 
north，故而C 选项与原文矛盾，能够undermine the conclusion. 
 
2. 定位到Proponents of … point out that … and that evidence for the first stage of rice 
cultivation is missing. 可知B 选项正确。 
 
3. 根据This scenario was based on both on the … and on archaeological records of very early 
domestic rice from Southeast Asia and India (now known to be not so old as first reported) 
 
从括号中的表述知道，这些records 是有问题的。 
 
D 选项正确。 
 
 
 


 
 
Passage 203 
 
1. 定位到倒数第二句。Sea cows were totally dependent on kelp for food, and within a decade 
of the onset of otter hunting.可推知，sea cows 被捕杀的就少了，从而kelp forests 的数量
将减少。A 选项正确。 
 
其余选项均在文章找不到对应依据。 
 
2. 定位到倒数第三句。Fewer otters would have allowed sea urchin populations on which the 
otters preyed to expand and the urchins’ grazing pressure on kelp forest to increase. 
 
可知，如果otters 数量减少，那么urchins 的数量将增加，对kelp forest 的压力也将增加。
B 选项正确。 
 
A 选项错，sea cow 与sea urchin 并无该关系。 
 
C、D、E 选项错，无中生有。 
 
Passage 204 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：定位到最后一句，makes it clear that the leadership …, and that overall the relative …
由后半句，可知，revolutionary leader 更关注的是liberty and property 而不是equality. B 选
项正确。 
 
A 选项错，与原文相反，was anything but “恰恰不是” homogeneous 
 
C 选项错，provide freedom and wealth for all colonial citizens 无中生有 
 
D 选项错，was cynically manipulated 无依据 
 
E 选项错，无法得知。 
 
2.  答案：D 
 
解析：关于第一个account，原文说到unsurpassed in its promise of human equality;关于第
二个account,原文说到，as having wielded promises of equality merely as deceptive tools. D
选项符合。 
 
3. 答案：E 
 
解析：要想质疑文中高亮部分，我们可以强调，他们同样重视，甚至是更重视equality. E 选
项正确。 


 
 
 
Passage 205 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
文章一开头提到Dust Tracks on a Road, has received some of the most negative criticism，
而后文对这个现象进行解释。然后作者转折了，说这种错误是有原因的，所以B 选项的描述
最合适，supposed deficiency 就是那种“被信以为真的缺陷”，实际上是没有缺陷的。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
从But Dust Tracks portrays a persona that resists reduction to a coherent unity 开始，文章
就在描述这个小说为什么会fragmentary，然后说很多东西是因为作者必须要描绘一个不同
的persona，所以就不符合传统的标准了，所以这个题答案选A 选项，因为文章最后是在为
这个Dust Tracks 的作者做辩护了。 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：文章的结构从前两个题就很容易看出来，就是先提出了传统的观点，然后再反驳了传
统的观点，所以最合适的选项是D 选项。 
 
Passage 206 
 
1. 本文结构可概括为：some critics have celebrated…; This view overlooks…; In truth, … 
 
A 选项正确。 
 
B 选项错，以偏概全，这是一个细节。 
 
C 选项错，social significance 无中生有。 
 
D 选项错，本文讨论的是Johnson 的作品，而不是African American painters。 
 
E 选项错，largely overlooked 无中生有 
 
2. A 选项正确。高亮句tendency to present rural life 是对前一句Johnson’s conceptualization 
of South was largely formed before he left New York 的expand. 
 
B、C 选项文中无依据。 
 
Passage 207 
 
1. 根据speculates about the effect，可以对应到第四句，The possibility… 
 


 
 
2. A 选项错，原文中没有对应依据。 
 
文章说到which enforce prolonged interaction 对应continued exposure. 接着提到prevent 
the diluting effects … 可对应inflated，故而B 选项正确。 
 
文章提到evidence of individual recognition in free-ranging fish populations is equivocal.可
知C 选项正确。 
 
Passage 208 
 
1.    推断题 
 
利用lastsection 进行定位，定位到文章最后一句。 
 
最后一句提到，thebook’s tone changes abruptly in the last section, 同时，注意到前一句
提到，.,.during the first two thirds of the book are repetitious. 由此，我们可以推断出E 选项
正确。（注意本题是推断题， E 选项会被很多同学误排除，认为文章没有提到。） 
 
A 选项错，文章并没有就last section 和first part of the book 进行literary quality 的比较。 
 
B 选项错，文章并没有将last section 和Dickens 的其他作品就tedious fashion 进行比较。 
 
C 选项错，文章并没有对characters 是否optimistic 进行比较。 
 
D 选项错，last section 是否atypical of Dickens’ general storytelling style，文章未提及。 
 
2.    信息目的题 
 
根据题干定位到文章第二句。 
 
利用这些作品的成功（这些作品分别是在Hard Times 之前或之后发表），目的就是想突出主
句中Hard Times seemsto have been Dickens’ least popular novel 的观点。可知，C 选项正
确。 
 
A 选项错，helps to explain the public andcritical reaction 没有依据。 
 
B 选项错，other works 是否initially commercially successful 未提及。（当然此处，也可以理
解为not initially commercially successful 与文中的sensationalsuccess 矛盾） 
 
D 选项错，quality of Dickens’ writing 未提及。 
 
E 选项错，文中并未question 这些作品的成功。 
 
3.    EXCEPT 型否定事实信息题。 


 
 
 
注意，本题需要选的是哪个选项不是Hard Times 不受欢迎的原因。 
 
A 选项错，对应Jacobs also suggest…，此为Hard Times 不受欢迎的原因。 
 
B+C 选项错，对应Part of the reason…这两个选项均为Hard Times 不受欢迎的原因。 
 
D 选项正确，对应最后一句中When 引导的时间状语从句，可知此时book’s tone changes 
abruptly,可知该选项属于HardTimes 的亮点部分，而非不受欢迎的原因。 
 
E 选项错误，对应文中最后一句the reader must first…，可知way that the novel establishes 
its character 是reader 需要忍受的tedious way，此为Hard Times 不受欢迎的原因。 
 
Passage 209 
 
1.    事实信息题 
 
正确答案是原文定位句的同义替换。本题利用题干中的arrival of the Recent Indians 可以定
位到倒数第二句。（当然此处，同学们会在其他地方找到Recent Indians，但是我们还应注意
到题干中的resulted from，可以与倒数第二句中的in response to 对应）（我们在做此题时，
只需考虑倒数第二句，这是本题的答案区间） 
 
A 选项错，compete with the Recent Indiansfor a limited supply of seals 未提及。 
 
B 选项正确，intensified their harvest ofseals 与spent more time harvesting seals 同义替换。 
 
C 选项错，defending their territory 未提及。 
 
D 选项错，adopt new subsistence strategies 原文未提及。 
 
E 选项错，population came to halt 未提及。 
 
2.    句子作用题 
 
（机经中并未显示该高亮句，但是通过答案反推，我觉得应该是文章的最后一句。） 
 
高亮句和前一句是正向的关系，故此，可以排除E。 
 
A 选项错，flaw 无中生有。 
 
B 选项错，need for additional research 无中生有。 
 
C 选项错，underscores the importance 无中生有 
 


 
 
D 选项正确，符合高亮句与前文的句间关系。 
 
Passage 210 
 
1.    逻辑单题-假设 
 
此题的提问方式，很像句子作用题，但是请注意，此题并没有问该高亮句是什么作用，而是
问在高亮句中，the author assumes that。即，要想使得高亮句成立，需要补充一个什么假
设。这正是逻辑单题中假设的考法。 
 
阅读最后一句话之后，要从半句推出高亮句，最大的逻辑漏洞在于，expectations 和
satisfaction 是否有关系未知。从高亮句的表达，能够看出，作者是默认二者之间是有关联的，
所以才能从前半句推导出高亮句。补足该漏洞，本题选C。 
 
A 选项错，原文说larger assortments canincrease the likelihood，表述的是一种可能性，而
A 选项直接说depends almost exclusively on the size of the range，与原文矛盾。 
 
B+E 选项错，本题的逻辑和是否quickly 无关。 
 
D 选项错，与the preferences they hadbeforehand 无关。 
 
2.    句子作用题 
 
从文章结构分析可知，首句是作者结论（最后一句）得到的前提。A 选项正确。 
 
B 选项，容易误选，但是请注意题干问的是as a whole 的作用。 
 
C+D 选项错，第一句是前提,作者并没有证明其illogical 和dispute。 
 
E 选项错，文章并未解释首句，而是以此为前提展开后续内容的讨论。 
 
Passage 211 
 
1.    可多选题+推断题 
 
本题如果利用题干foundermutations 进行定位的话，将会发现全文都是相关的内容。所以
此题，最佳的做法是利用选项来定位，并验证是否正确。 
 
A 选项正确，根据选项能够定位到Furthermore, the singlecopy of a founder mutation often 
confers a survival advantage on carriers. 
 
B 选项正确，根据选项能够定位到原文This apparent anomalyis … becomes ill. 
 
C 选项错误，文中并没有就founder mutations 和other mutations 谁更容易passed to 


 
 
offspring 进行比较，属于无中生有。 
 
2.    信息目的题。 
 
本题属于简单题，问hereditaryhemochromatosis mutation 的作用，该信息是利用For 
example 引导出的，作用很明显就是为上一句的观点举例（前一句正好说到advantage on 
carriers），故本题选D。 
 
ABCE 选项均可归为无中生有。 
 
Passage 212 
 
1.    主旨题 
 
对于本题，大家需要关注到：如果一篇文章有两段及以上，并且这篇文章有主旨题，那么该
题考察的是文章的段落关系。 
 
由第二段首句，Butnewer evidence of a different pulsar with planets is more promising，可
知第一段是在介绍旧的evidence。由此，可知本文的主旨assess the credibility ofrecent 
findings。加之，首段提到了theorists would have haddifficulty accounting for the existence 
of such a planet，可知unverified existence of a class of objects，对应正确。本题选C。 
 
A 选项错，an example of the dangers 无中生有。 
 
B+E 选项错，文章虽提到一句theorists would have haddifficulty accounting for the existence 
of such a planet，但并未具体提及这种difficulty，也并没提及how difficult。这两个选项容
易误选。 
 
D 选项错，seemingly contradictoryphenomenon 无中生有。 
 
2.    组织结构题 
 
本题与主旨题相似，由第一题的文章结构思路，可知此题选A。 
 
B 选项错，rejected 无中生有。 
 
C 选项错，a set of observational data 无中生有。 
 
D 选项错，analysis of the same material 无中生有。 
 
E 选项错，an approach to furtherinvestigation is recommend 无中生有。 
 
3.    推断题 
 


 
 
定位到首段最后一句。由itrotates relatively slowly, implying that it has not interacted with 
any nearbystar since the supernova，推知D 选项正确。 
 
其余选项均无推断依据。 
 
Passage 213 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章开头是一个对比转折：extinctions ofindigenous species caused by the introduction 
of non-indigenous predators andpathogens，由非本地捕食者或病原体引起的本地动物灭绝
很多，但是surprisingly few extinctions of indigenous species can be attributed tocompetition 
from introduced species，即物种竞争引起的灭绝其实是很少的。作者然后北美的证据。但
是，作者认为，从该证据可能得出两种替代性解释。 
 
该题问文章主旨，从文章结构分析可知A 选项最准确。 
 
B 选项，conflicting data 没有提到。 
 
C 选项，resolving a debate 原文没有。 
 
D 选项，comparing two theories 原文没有 
 
E 选项，refuting a proposedexplanation 不准确。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：问题考察作者举北美非本地植物例子的作用。根据文章结构，该例子为上位句服务：
However, surprisingly few extinctions of indigenous species can beattributed to competition 
from introduced species.可知选E。 
 
Passage 214 
 
1.    主旨题 
 
本文是典型的现象解释类文章，文章开头提出一个现象（less permanence），后文对这个现
象进行解释讨论。C 选项正确。 
 
A 选项错，differences in the threats 无中生有 
 
B 选项错，以偏概全，这并不是本文的主旨，只是文中的一个细节。 
 
D 选项错，debate 无中生有。 
 


 
 
E 选项错，certain consequences 无中生有。 
 
2.    推断题 
 
根据“ecologicalboundaries of the sea”定位到首段倒数第二句。然，首段最后一句也提到
accomplishthis，出现指示代词，可知该句也是答案句。We can accomplish this onlyindirectly 
by 与less susceptible to direct humanintervention 对应。由此，可推知E 选项正确。 
 
A 选项错，increasingly sensitive 无中生有。 
 
B 选项错，是否会显著影响未知。 
 
C 选项错，整体无中生有。 
 
D 选项错，该比较关系在定位区间并不能体现。 
 
Passage 215 
 
1.    推断题 
 
根据Du Bois 和Spencerian sociologists 可以定位到原文第二句。本题实质上是考察长难句
分析。 
 
their (Spenceriansociologists) work examined not deeds but theories and they 
(Spenceriansociologists) gathered data not to affect social progress but merely totheorize。
可知，Spenceriansociologists 认为theorizing 更重要，综上，A 选项正确。 
 
B 选项错，vast generalization 非答案区间。 
 
C 选项错，relatively unimportant 比较关系的无中生有 
 
D 选项错，cultural artifacts 非答案区间 
 
E 选项错，无中生有。 
 
2.   答案：AB 
 
可多选题+推断题 
 
根据Du Bois 和sociology 可以定位到文章最后一句。本题仍然考察长难句分析。本句的核
心结构为：shiftfrom A to B and C，B 和 C 所代表的部分即使本题答案。 
 
observation ofparticular, living individual elements of society 可推出B 选项正确。 
 


 
 
workingcontributions of individual people to a vast functioning social structure 可推出A 选
项正确。C 选项错，无中生有。 
 
3. 【新增题目】答案：B 
 
解析：本题与第二题的考点有重合，根据最后一句可以选出B 选项，AC 均属于无中生有。 
 
Passage 216 
 
1.    推断题 
 
本题利用naturalresources in South China 进行定位，可以定位到文章第二句和最后一句。
此处，做一个说明，虽然题干中有6,500 years，这个比较明显的时间段，但是对于本题的定
位并没有任何作用。因为全文就第三句出现了时间，其他地方并没有出现新的时间，说明本
文都是在这个时间背景下。当然，如果一开始就定位到第三句，那也能很快发现：情况不对，
赶紧撤退。 
 
原文最后一句说到，cultivationin South China may not occur,因为foraging might be a 
moreefficient way of life  A 选项正确。 
 
B 选项错，as…as 同级比较，无中生有。 
 
C 选项错，cultural contact 非答案区间，出现在第四句。 
 
D 选项错，been downplayed 无中生有。 
 
E 选项错，可以从两个方面来理解：一，该选项和A 选项矛盾，不可能是little influence;二，
influence on the type ofplants 无中生有。 
 
2.    推断题 
 
利用题干定位到原文2、3、4 句。 
 
原文说到，cerealcultivation did not occur in this region (South China) until 
approximately7,000 to 6,500 years ago.同时提到，This cultivation waslikely a result of cultural 
contact with and expansion from the Yangtze Basin. 
 
由此，可知YangtzeBasin 的cultivation 会更早，prior to6,500 years ago. B 选项正确。 
 
A、C、D 选项，文中无依据。 
 
E 选项错，因果倒置。This cultivation (SouthChina) was likely a result of cultural contact with 
and expansion from theYangtze Basin. 而不是相反 
 


 
 
Passage 217 
 
1.    推断题 
 
本题的定位信息并不好使，一是时间，一是cats,而这两个东西贯穿全文，故而本题建议从选
项入手。 
 
A 选项错，该比较无中生有。 
 
B 选项错，ferrets 是能够preforming directed tasks。 
 
C 选项错，该比较无中生有。 
 
D 选项正确，even as mousers, terrier dogsand ferrets are preferable。 
 
E 选项错，与首句矛盾。 
 
2.    句子作用题（highlight 句是文章倒数第二句） 
 
A 选项错，高亮句并没有challenge 一个观点。 
 
B 选项错，long puzzled researchers 无中生有 
 
C 选项正确。 
 
D 选项错，高亮句是一个观点，而不是facts 
 
E 选项错，formulates a new hypothesis 无中生有。 
 
Passage 218 
 
1.    主旨题 
 
本文是一个典型的总分结构。由首句，cites three primary problems with the labeling，（表
明这样做是有问题的）然后下文，具体解释这三个问题，可知本题B 选项正确。 
 
2.    推断题 
 
根据politicalcentralization 可以定位到文章最后一句。 
 
文章说到thisdoes not indicate that Cahokia was politically centralized，并且文章开头说到
了，Cahokia 应该是chiefdom 而不是state（开头说到，把Cahokia 归为state，会有三个主
要的问题），所以，可知politicallycentralized 应该是state 的特征。C 选项正确。 
 


 
 
A 选项错，无中生有，和人数无关。 
 
B 选项错，distinguished from 无中生有 
 
D 选项错，result from 因果关系无中生有 
 
E 选项错，无中生有 
 
Passage 219 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：本文介绍了La Selva 的研究，并把它与主流的理论和Keeling 的理论进行对比。C 选
项正确，指出一个研究对两个理论的影响。
（注意，本文很多同学会误认为是新旧观点对比，
事实上，本文第二句的However，这是对首句观点的限定补充，而并没有提出新的观点。） 
 
A 选项错，逻辑错误，文章并没有支持这个popular theory，相反，La Selva 的研究质疑了
该popular theory； 
 
B 选项错，show the underlying similarities 无中生有； 
 
D 选项错，alternative explanation 属于新旧观点的结构，此外，文章也没有well-documented 
phenomenon； 
 
E 选项错，reconcile 无中生有，文章并没有调和两个理论。 
 
2.    逻辑单题-归纳 
 
本题根据trees in the La Selva study 可以定位到第二句；同时，我们可以注意到五个选项中
都提到同一个时间1984-2000，这正是第二句的时间段，更加确定定位正确。 
 
between 1984 to2000, … with trees adding twice as much wood in some cooler years as they 
did in the scorching EI Nino year of 1997-1998。可归纳出A 选项正确。 
 
其余选项并无对应逻辑，此题属于简单题。 
 
3.    推断题 
 
根据temperatures rise 和trees in the tropical regions 可以定位到第三句：rapidly rising global 
temperatures，driven by human-generated emissions of CO2, may be pushing tropical forests 
to release more CO2, thereby intensifying global warming. 可知，D 选项正确。（呼吸作用更
多，光合作用减少，CO2 的排放就会更多） 
 
其余选项并无依据。 


 
 
 
Passage 220 
 
1.    信息目的题 
 
此类题型往往考察的是文章的逻辑结构（句间、句内关系） 
 
题目所问的信息在倒数第三句，而倒数第三句和第二句都是在举一个具体的例子，目的就是
为了得到最后一句的假设：native hunters’ fish avoidance 
 
D 选项正确。 
 
A 选项错，无中生有 
 
B 选项错，与倒数第三句信息矛盾，原文说到had adapted tolean-meat diets 
 
C 选项错，非答案区间，这是首句的内容。 
 
E 选项错，方向错。本题问到的信息，与上下文都是正向的关系，call into question 错。 
 
2.    选句子 
 
本题需要寻找全文解释的现象，根据Malainey et al. find a possible explanation，可知文章
第二句，正是the phenomenon that the passage is concerned with finding an explanation 
for。（为啥他们不吃鱼？） 
 
Passage 221 
 
1. 句子作用题（根据答案反推，高亮句应该是第三句） 
 
A 选项错，refute the legitimacy 无中生有 
 
B 选项正确。 
 
C 选项错，distinction between two theories 无中生有 
 
2.    事实信息题 
 
本题定位到最后一句，the emergence of insects relative to the timing of songbird migration，
可知C 选项正确。 
 
本题最具干扰的选项是E 选项，文章确实说到a significant decline in populations of pied 
flycatchers，但是文中并未说到populations of insects 就会因此上升。属于无中生有 
 


 
 
Passage 222 
 
1.    推断题 
 
定位到文章倒数第二句，由places that humans have made impassable.可推导出B 选项正
确。 
 
A 选项错，disappear 无中生有 
 
C 选项错，比较关系无中生有 
 
D+E 选项，亦在文中找不到依据 
 
2.    推断题 
 
文章开头说到了Widespread climate change challenges traditional notions that preserving 
specific… 由此可知，D 选项正确。 
 
Passage 223 
 
1.    推断题 
 
本题问red squirrels 和gray squirrels 的区别。文中出现多处这种对比，∴本题无法用题干
进行准确定位，可用选项来定位。 
 
A 选项正确，对应最后一句。red squirrels successfully colonize…， they may not compensate 
completely for the loss of gray squirrels as seed dispersers. 
 
B 选项错，无比较 
 
C 选项逻辑错，gray squirrels are scatter hoarders 
 
D、E 错，无比较。 
 
2.    选句子 
 
倒数第二句 
 
Passage 224 
 
1.    主旨题 
 
文章开头引入一个问题：Howgood an artist was Rockwell? 之后，开始对其technique 进行
评估。 


 
 
 
C 选项正确。 
 
A 选项错，change 无中生有 
 
B 选项错，overrated 无中生有 
 
D 选项错，placing… in its historical context 无中生有 
 
E 选项错，contrasting 无中生有 
 
2.    推断题 
 
His technique…undistinguished; his anatomical competence was limited; However, 
Rockwell’s work does exhibit a genius in…可知E 选项正确 
 
A 选项错，evaluated fairly 与首句矛盾 
 
B 选项错，because 无中生有 
 
C 选项错，artistic merit 无中生有 
 
D 选项错，rejected by 无中生有 
 
3.    选句子 
 
本题是简单题，答案是首句。 
 
Passage 225 
 
1.    推断题（更像词汇题） 
 
porous: easy to pass or get through 
 
可知，C 选项正确。 
 
2.    词汇题 
 
islands 与前面porous frontiers 对立，故而本题应选择not easy to pass or get through，即
D 选项relatively inaccessible.(此处更像是考察inaccessible 这个单词呐) 
 
Passage 226 
 
1.  句子作用题 


 
 
 
A 选项正确 
 
首句提到，对中世纪手稿的边界装饰被称为pen flourishing；紧接着，第二句说到，flourishing
可以用来localizing（定位）和粗略定年手稿。然而，高亮句却指出，在完成后，印刷书稿出
售时都不加以装饰，而由买家委托在其他地方装饰。从而加大了localizing 书稿的难度。 
 
B 选项错，restate 无中生有 
 
C 选项错，correct a misconception，高亮句与前文是正向关系 
 
D、E 选项，无中生有 
 
2.    事实信息题 
 
根据pen flourishing in manuscripts, valuable information 可以定位第二句。 
 
useful tool for localizing and roughly dating manuscripts. 可知D 选项正确。 
 
Passage 227 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
主旨题 
 
首先，本文是立论。故而，B 选项，alternative 驳论型排除；D 选项refute 排除。 
 
A 选项，parallel effects 过于细节，排除。 
 
C 选项，importance of Californian cities 无中生有 
 
E 选项正确。 
 
2. 答案：A 
 
本题问20 世纪早期，为什么San Francisco 会成为jazz center。定位到文章第二句，这句话
明显指出是因为nightclub 的生意导致了San Francisco 的jazz 繁荣。 
 
3．推断题 
 
利用1921 可以定位到原文，指出government closed the Barbary Coast. This closure was the 
decisive event that established Los Angeles as the premier center for jazz 
 
可知B 选项正确。 


 
 
 
Passage228 
 
1. 答案：第三句 
 
解析：Long marginalized by scholars as little more than an apprentice of Edouard Manet, 
Gonzales is revealed by the exhibition as possessing remarkable, if uneven, talents.这句话很
明显是说以前G 这个人只被当成一个学徒（贬义），二现在是remarkable talents（褒义），
所以答案是这句话。 
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：此题较难，必须把握整个文章的结构才能推出来。后文都是在说这个exhibition 有很
多欠缺的地方，而文章的观点是再说G 这个人是正面评价的，所以正好对这个exhibition 就
是起到一个补充的作用，所以complement 是最合适的选项。 
 
Passage 229 
 
逻辑单题-削弱 
 
本文的结论是最后一句：Industry must have instituted highly effective energy conservation 
measures… 
 
削弱结论，就变成了Industry must have not instituted …，所以这个题，其实就是找他因。
并不是industry 采取了什么有效的能源措施，而是其他原因，使得1980 的能源消耗低于
1970。 
 
A 选项错，如果使用低价油以后，·1980 的能源消耗不一定会低于1970. 
 
B 选项错，本文讨论的industrial use of energy，而和residential energy consumption 没有
关系。 
 
C 选项错，无关。1970 之前，不关注能源保护，和我们讨论的between 1970 to 1980 无关。 
 
D 选项错，原文已知细节的补充，并不影响结论。 
 
E 选项正确，industrial use of energy 的降低，是因为能源密集型的企业产量减少，而不是因
为effective energy conservation measures。找他因成功。 
 
Passage 230 
这篇文章的推理过程大致是：①J 松树不能活在水里（只能活在干旱期）→干旱结束后J 松
树一定会死亡；②J 松树只活了120 年；（①+②）→干旱持续时间少于150 年。这个推理过
程存在的问题是，它无法确定干旱开始的时间，因为可能在J 松树开始生长前干旱期就早已
开始。 


 
 
A 选项错误，1200 年后其他树种是否开始生长并不影响文中推断，因为文中提到的年代测
定方法是针对J 松树的，不会受到其他树种影响，即使有其他耐水树种始终存活，也与本文
讨论的问题无关。 
B 选项错误，更深的湖底中是否有树存在不影响文中推断，因为树木生长的湖底区域深浅与
否充其量只能说明干旱的程度，不影响对干旱是否存在的判断。 
C 选项错误，是否有树活过整个120 年不影响文中推断，因为文中提到的年代检测方法已经
证明1200 年至1320 年都有J 松树生长。即使每棵树只活了一年，也不影响“J 松树存活于
1200 至1320 年间”这一推断。 
D 选项错误，后期是否有干旱再次发生不影响文中推断，因为后期是否还有干旱发生与这一
时期的研究无关。同时，通过年代检测方法已经证明J 松树只存活于1200 至1320 年的连
续120 年间，即已经可以说明文中特指的这一干旱期结束于1320 年。 
E 选项正确，因为文中没有证据说明干旱何时开始，如果在J 松树开始生长时干旱已经持续
了超过30 年，那么再加上J 松树生长期的120 年，总干旱期就会超过150 年，与文中结论
相违背。 
 
Passage 231 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：首先这个题目的要求其实是找假设。题目说飞机上被推荐的电影因为画质差，所以C
不喜欢，然后被嘲笑的电影C 也不会喜欢，所以C 不会在飞机上喜欢任何电影。题目有一
个遗漏的地方，就是既没有被推荐，但也没有被嘲笑的电影C 是有可能看的，所以如果要题
目的结论成立的话，那么必须要求不存在既没有被推荐，但也没有被嘲笑的电影。所以正确
答案是C 选项。 
 
Passage 232 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：文章的意思是说近期海豚因为传染病死了很多，而且在海豚体内发现能够削弱抵抗传
染病的化合物，化合物的来源是船画，而且海豚能自己排除化合物，所以只要船画被禁止了，
海豚的死亡率就会下降。题目需要加强这个结论。C 选项能够起到加强的作用，因为如果化
合物被海豚排除之后然后又降解成为无害的物质的话，那么水中就不会有这种化合物，那么
海豚死亡率自然会下降。A 选项是个削弱选项，错。B 没有说海豚，错。D 选项也是没有提
到海豚，错。E 选项也没有直接提到禁止船画就能减少海豚死亡率的逻辑，错。 
 
Passage 233 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章的意思是说iridium 是很稀少的东西，高浓度的iridium 有两个来源：①火山爆
发；②陨石，科学家发现了高浓度的iridium 出现在恐龙灭绝的年代，所以推断出陨石是导
致恐龙灭绝的原因。题目要我们找一个加强结论的选项。A 选项正确，因为这个题无非就是
有人怀疑万一是火山爆发导致恐龙灭绝呢？A 选项把这个可能性基本排除了，所以起到了加


 
 
强结论的作用。B 选项时间和题目不一致，肯定无法加强。C 选项和题目陨石导致恐龙灭绝
是矛盾的。D 选项杀死了其他生命不能加强陨石使恐龙灭绝的结论。E 选项选项完全是无稽
之谈，时间和逻辑方向全错了。 
 
Passage 234 
 
答案：A 
 
解析：文章说蝴蝶离开出生地产卵，然后毛毛虫（蝴蝶小时候）吃出生地的植物，吸收
glycosides，而且不同地区的glycosides 是不一样的，所以可以根据蝴蝶体内的glycosides
来确定蝴蝶的出生地。A 选项其实是文章的一个假设，就是说毛毛虫变成蝴蝶之后不能再吃
含有glycosides 的植物了，要不然体内就混合了不同地方的glycosides，所以A 是一个加强
选项。B 选项看到toxic 直接排除。C 选项对文章结论没有任何加强作用，排除。D 选型说到
其他东西，不能加强本文的结论。E 选项和D 选项同理，排除。 
 
Passage 235 
 
答案：C 
 
解析：题目的意思是在压力下ag（adrenal glands）会增加c（corticosterone），然后wb（white 
blood）减少，然后如果没有ag 的话，wb 就不会减少，所以推出是因为ag 产生了c 所以
导致了wb 减少，很明显，有一个地方不严谨：wb 不一定是由于c 引起的，很可能是ag 产
生了另外一种激素，而这种激素引起wb 减少。所以正确答案选C 选项。 
 
Passage 236 
 
答案：D 
 
解析：文章很明显是两个直接对立的观点，前面的观点认为孩子的psychology 是不一样的，
后面的观点则认为孩子的获得行为特征的心理方法（psychological mechanism）是一样的，
他们对于psychology 的理解是不同的，所以答案选D 选项。 
 
Passage 237 
 
1. 文章开头说到，学者未能把Addams 的ideas 和其他activists 和public intellectuals 做足
够的对比。然后在文章最后，又提到了such contextualizing effort 是能够带来好处的。D 选
项正确。 
 
A 选项错，extent of her debt to other social activists and public intellectuals 无中生有。 
 
B 选项错，misunderstood 无中生有 
 
C 选项错，debate …regarding Addams’ approach 无中生 
 


 
 
E 选项错，过于细节，以偏概全。 
 
2. 根据高亮信息定位到原文，可知从句提到相关的信息，目的是为了服务主语提到的her 
contribution emerges as far more cooperative than groundbreaking. E 选项正确。 
 
Passage 238 
 
1. 文中说到,using large mammals’ bones can be problematic. 可知，答案将在下一句产生。 
 
由both carnivores and humans can have lager hunting territories and …可知这是其中的一个
obstacle，A 选项正确。B 选项错误，文章最后一句说到了small mammals provide a better 
index of climate change. C 选项正确，在举例是，提到了，such as red deer, are very 
adaptable-…这也会到reconstruct past climate changes 造成障碍。 
 
2.举red deer 为例，目的是为了说明using larger mammals’ bones 来做预测，是有问题
的，是不好的。E 选项正确。 
 
Passage 239 
 
1. 定位到原文第三句。truncates the biologically rich early stage of ecological succession 对
应A 选项。 
 
increase the severity of future fires 对应C 选项。（C 选项的意思是replant 比起not replant
更严重，不要理解错了） 
 
B 选项错，比较关系的无中生有。 
 
2. 定位到原文第二句。native seed sources are almost always sufficient for early nature 
reestablishment of native species. 可知B 选项正确。不需要human interventions。 
 
其余选项在答案区间均无对应逻辑。 
 
Passage 240 
 
1. A 选项错，无中生有 
 
B、C 选项错，文中并无此种比较关系 
 
D 选项正确，对应，ancient craters in the Terra Sirenum region, astronomers believe these 
craters were formed some 3.8 billion years ago from the impact of chunks of debris. 
 
E 选项错，非答案区间。下一句并不是本题的讨论范围。 
 
2.考察句间关系，最后一句说到，The Surveyor findings thus suggest that… 该结论是基于上


 
 
一句提出的，而上一句提到了，realigned and remagnetized 的能力, 本题选C。 
 
3. inner solar system, where Mars orbits the Sun 
 
能够解释出size and location of … 
 
C 选项正确。 
 
其余选项无依据。 
 
Passage 241 
 
第一题 
 
本题简单，信息目的题的基本操作，冲分班课程的必讲题型，A 选项正确。定位信息就是在
强调samba 作为一种音乐风格的起源。 
 
第二题 
 
主旨题 
 
文章首段介绍了关于samba’s history 的不同的观点，二三段展示了这些不同观点对名族身
份认同的影响，本题选D。 
 
第三题 
 
根据题干定位到原文第二段第二句，由still forms part of a unifying national spirit，可知本
题选C。 
 
第四题 
 
事实信息题，正确答案即为原文定位句的同义替换。定位到第二段最后一句，由consolidate 
political dominance 可知C 选项正确secure its own political power。 
 
Passage 242 
 
第一题 
 
文章第一句显示paintings of property 是被抨击的，而后在文章下文指出Political power and 
status were thus based on the ownership of property, while at the same time they were 
legitimated by the claim…综上，本题选E。 
 
第二题 
 


 
 
文中Yet this  notion  of disinterested taste and virtue was founded on private interest: it 
was because the “public” man or woman already owned enough that he or she was 
presumed to be free from the urge to own more.体现作者对高亮内容的态度，可选出C，本
题不难。 
 
第三题 
 
本题没法利用题干进行定位，只能从选项一一检验。A 正确，其余选项与原文矛盾或无中生
有。 
 
第四题 
 
本文首句提出一个批评，而后文指出这个批评存在着缺点，C 选项符合结构。 
 
Passage 243 
 
第一题 
 
本题如果用人名定位的话，将发现全文都是这个人的描述。此题最好从选项出发，一一判定。
D 选项正确，对应文章最后一句many of whom were drawn to her early movies precisely 
because of her fame as a tango singer。 
 
第二题 
 
本题也没法从题干入手来定位，因为全文都围绕tango 展开。建议本题也从选项出发，A 选
项对应第三句。其余选项可根据无中生有等错误来排除。 
 
Passage 244 
 
第一题 
 
主旨结构题 
 
本文开头提出Progressivism has undergone significant scholarly reevaluation。而后文从时
间顺序的维度展示了这种变化过程。本题选D。 
 
第二题 
 
根据题干定位到原文倒数第二句，本题就是考查同义替换，并不难。B 选项正确。 
 
第三题 
 
主旨题 
 


 
 
本题和第一题异曲同工。可以根据第一题中，对文章结构的分析，选出E 选项。Trace 正好
体现文中提到的时间维度上的变化。 
 
Passage 245 
 
第一题 
 
词汇题，本题较简单，就是考查simply 的字面含义，从上下文也可知，此处是想表达Roberts
对其它学者观点的质疑，Roberts 认为不能仅仅因为那个，就推出这个。E 选项正确。 
 
第二题 
 
本题考查Seri violin 的起源，注意到题干问的是原因（be based on），正好对应到文中第二
句的therefore 表示因果关系，所以本题的答案可以锁定在第一句。unique 对应rarity，本题
选B。 
 
第三题 
 
本题考查Roberts 的观点，可以定位到文章最后一句，选出D 选项，本题不难。 
 
第四题 
 
句子作用题 
 
利用句子作用题的步骤，常规操作，E 选项正确。(本题高亮句是第四句)。 
 
Passage 246 
 
第一题 
 
根据题干可以定位到第二段第一句和第二句，本题的难点在于对这两句话的理解。大猩猩do 
not know when others can and cannot see them，而同时它们do not preferentially beg food 
from a human with uncovered eyes over begging it from one wearing a blindfold，可以理解
为它们更喜欢向戴着眼罩的人寻找食物，从而可知A 选项正确。 
 
第二题 
 
根据原文The main finding was that chimpanzees gestured differently to the human 
depending on whether the human’s face was oriented toward them, but only if the human 
was facing them bodily as well，可知这一关键在于脸是否对着它们，可知B 选项是大猩猩
认为它们能被人类看到。而本题是问，看不到的情况，所以选AC。 
 
第三题 
 


 
 
本题的本质是一个信息目的题，考查句间句内关系。由下文的This accords with the findings…
可知D 选项正确。 
 
第四题 
 
主旨题考查文章结构：文章开头提出一个观点，随后给出几个特定的发现；接着对该观点可
能的解释进行了讨论。C 选项正确。 
 
第五题 
 
本文提到Kaminski et al.的目的是为了质疑Povinelli and Eddy 的观点，从而支持本文的主要
观点。E 选项正确。 
 
第六题 
 
本题的B 选项和第一题类似，要选。同时，根据Kaminski et al. modified this paradigm…可
推知C 正确。A 无中生有。 
 
第七题 
 
根据gesturing 可以定位到文章第一段，由于本题范围过大，建议从选项入手，一一排除。
A 选项正确。它们gesturing 都是有目的性的。 
 
Passage 247 
 
第一题 
 
组织结构题，考查文章的结构：文章首段给出一个事实battle between farmers and the pests 
began；随后在首段最后一句提出本文的核心观点，many of the short-term triumphs by 
farmers have carried with them the seeds of longer-term failure。而文章第二段和第三段则
分别举了一个例子论证，综上，本题选A。 
 
第二题 
 
根据the strategy of rotating crops 可以定位到末段，末端指出该种方法有效，但是同时也存
在问题（很快被一些害虫适应）。可选A，并不是对所有的害虫都有效。其余选项均可由无
中生有排除。 
 
第三题 
 
本题既考查逻辑单题的逻辑，又考查EXCEPT 型否定事实信息题的逻辑。ABCD 都符合农名
不轮种玉米的理由（要么经济效益不高，要么这种效率低下）；E 选项正确，没有发现抵抗
这种害虫的玉米种类，那你可以种其它的农作物啊，你又不，那你就是错误答案咯。 
 


 
 
第四题 
 
本题与第一题异曲同工，利用文章结构分析，本题不难选出E 选项。 
 
Passage 248 
 
第一题，根据题干定位到第三句，可以对应D 选项正确，其余选项无中生有或与原文矛盾。 
 
第二题，本题用题干定位会有难度，建议从选项出发，然后需要注意到本题问的是作者的观
点，A 选项容易误选，这是others 的观点，而不是作者的观点。E 选项正确，increasing plants’ 
vulnerability to pests and diseases 对应less hardy。 
 
Passage 249 
 
第一题 
 
根据最后一句中，since in follow-up studies only one type of imitative response toward a 
facial expression (that is, tongue protrusion) was observed,对应A 选项正确，只有很少的部
分被证实。其余选项无中生有。 
 
第二题 
 
Meltzoff 认为such neonatal imitation is the origin of later imitation, which appears at 
approximately eight to twelve months of age；然而研究人员却认为the neonatal imitative 
response disappears or is lessened at approximately two months，可见Meltzoff 留下了一个
悬而未决的问题，因为这个问题没法得到解释与验证。对应D 选项。 
 
Passage 250 
 
第一题 
 
根据medieval astronomers 可以定位到文章第一句。再根据calculating lunar and solar 
positions, to predict an extraordinarily high flood tide，可以推出B 选项。 
 
第二题 
 
本题问Hodgson 的态度，可以定位到第二句。再根据Chaucer’s purpose here is artistic, 
not scientific, …, this “highly technical account of the Clerk’s astrological calculations need 
not be taken too seriously”,可以推出C 选项正确。 
 
第三题 
 
通过分析文章结构可知：文章开头文学学者Phyllis Hodgson 对一篇文章中的内容提出质疑，
认为这并不科学，而是艺术的东西；然而，文章后面质疑了Phyllis 的观点，并给出解释支持


 
 
了该篇文章的科学性，E 选项正确。其余选项均在纠结于细节。 
 
Passage251 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：这个例子是来证明前面一句话“Of course, it was not wholly new.”的。这个题的of 
course是一个表示转折的逻辑词，前面说这个style是new，然后这里转折说not wholly new，
然后后面例子来证明这个说法，所以答案是A 选项。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：这个题我们需要找到the impact of Impressionism 的原因，这里的impact 实际上指
的就是new 这个特征，而这个new 的原因则定位到文章最后一句话“but they were aware, 
too, that they had taken these painters’ unconventional experiments to unfamiliar levels and, 
consolidating themselves as a movement, had indeed made painting new. ”所以这句话表
达的主要意思等价于E 选项“the solidarity of its practitioners”。 
 
Passage252 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：先定位文章中的free time，然后看到句子里面有一个even 表示递进的用法，说明这
里free time 的作用和前一句是同方向的。而前一句说“granted scientists considerable 
latitude to develop their ideas and follow them in unexpected directions”，也就是说这里的
free time 其实就是公司给科学家做研究的自由，而且是在不确定是否能够带来收益的前提
下给的自由，所以对应选项中的D 选项。  
 
2. 答案：C 
 
解析：这个题先要知道belief 的内涵，文章说和belief 相反的想法是：行业研究不是更受管
制，比起学术科学。所以belief 的内涵就是行业研究更受管制，所以选项里面和这个说法一
致的就只有C 选项了。 
 
3. 答案：B 
 
解析：先定位这句话在文章第三句，然后要注意到说话这句话之后的结果是公司同意科学家
在研究的时候更多的自由度，所以这句话就是在解释为什么公司会给科学家更多的自由度，
所以在选项中B 选项最合适。companies’ policies regarding their scientists’ research 指
的就是给与科学家更多自由度这个政策，motivate 体现因果关系。 
 
Passage253 
 
1. 答案：B 


 
 
 
解析：关于payments for outwork，文章主要说了因为女性地位问题，所以很多时候是由丈
夫去领工资，所以历史记录就会错误记录。所以体现最主要的点是错误记录，所以在选项中
提到有错误记录的只有B 选项，关键词misinterpret。 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：此题需要逐一分析选项。 
 
A 选项错误，无中生有，题目没有说outwork 和other kinds of wage labor 的工资谁高谁低。 
 
B 选项错误，无中生有，题目没有直接比较男女工资差异。 
 
C 选项错误，和文章内容矛盾，在讨论关于工资的间隔的时候，文章并没有区分男女，C 选
项则区分了男女。 
 
D 选项正确，定位到文章这一句话“most wage laborers were paid partly in goods and 
received cash wages only quarterly or once or twice a year.” 
 
E 选项错误，无中生有，文章不是由employers 来记录工资的。 
 
Passage254 
 
1. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章提到1993 年之前的evening bats 都栖息在建筑上，而1993 年之后则栖息在树
林里，而文章后面正是在解释这一变化的原因，所以提到这个事情的目的也是为了引出对于
这个变化的解释，所以答案选B 选项最合理。A 选项不对，提到这个事情并没有对前面进行
解释。C 选项容易被错选，提到这件事的目的不是为了削弱前面的理论，其实前面也没有理
论，只是两个不同的事实而已，主要是为了后面解释变化。D 选项的对比对象错了，E 选项
无中生有。 
 
2. 答案：E 
 
解析：这个题直接定位到这一句话“However, the disappearance after 1993 of previously 
known roosts in buildings suggests that this adaptation became less successful.”这句话就
是文章最后的解释，选项中只有E 选项是这句话的同义改写。 
 
Passage255 
 
1. 答案：D 
 
解析：高亮句告诉我们为什么有些人听得到声音而有些人听不到声音，这句话就证明了Keay
的假设是可以用来解释我们所观察到的现象的。 


 
 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：文章说流星离地面有30 公里，所以当人们看到流星的时候是不应该听到声音的（声
音传播比光慢很多），所以Keay 才提出了另外一种解释，所以答案选B。 
 
3. 答案：C 
 
解析：文章的逻辑是流星会先产生electromagnetic radiation，然后electromagnetic radiation
借助于transducer 然后产生可以听到的东西，而且文章说了有些人能听到声音（因为附近有
transducer）而另外一些人不能听到声音（附近没有声音），所以C 选项正确，因为如果两个
相隔很远的人都能听到声音，那一定是这两个人身边都有不同的transducer。 
 
Passage256 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：文章里面讨论的所有虫都是会靠之前储存的能量维持生活，而且对应到文章这一句话
“Nearly all evidence of such costs involves species whose larvae do not feed but rather 
subsist on stored nutrients, indicating that insufficient energy reserves may be an underlying 
cause of these costs.  
 
”。B 选项无中生有，C 选项也是无中生有，D 选项不是一定会减少尺寸，however 后面有
转折，E 选项也是无中生有。 
 
2. 答案：B 
 
解析：假设的内容是：Nearly all evidence of such costs involves species whose larvae do not 
feed but rather subsist on stored nutrients, indicating that insufficient energy reserves may 
be an underlying cause of these costs. 所以如果feed 的幼虫就更不太可能遇到这种负面的
结果。所以答案选B。 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：这篇文章都是在解释delayed metamorphosis costs 的原因，就是想告诉我们为什么
delayed metamorphosis 会产生哪些不好的costs，所以答案选D。 
 
Passage257 
 
1. 答案：C 
 
解析：主旨目的题。这篇文章第一句话就表明是work themes 在之前被忽视了，然后后文一
直在解释原因：到底是因为subject matter 还是因为view。 
 


 
 
2. 答案：D 
 
解析：tradition 指的是后面的initiated by Courbet and Millet and developed through the 
1880s by Breton, Bastien-Lepage, Pissaro, and Berthe Morisot, of representing rural labor，
所以提炼关键词是rural labor。 
 
3. 答案：A 
 
解析：对应文章最后一句话：The numerous Impressionist representations of activities (often 
those of women) that we might classify as work—a woman serving beer in a cafe, many 
paintings by Degas of the ballet (a physically demanding activity by any standard)—were 
instead classified as representations of leisure by those who held this view. 强调work 和
leisure 的定义问题。 
 
Passage258 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：这是一个加强题，需要加强横梁（beam）的木头是最初修船的时候就放上去的。E 选
项正确，该选项说修船者喜欢用刚砍下来的树来作为修船的木材，而且题目说了横梁的木材
就是在1511 年之前砍下的，所以就能够加强这个结论。 
 
Passage259 
 
1. 答案：A 
 
解析：这是一个加强题。需要加强的结论是polypheonols 能够预防癌症，题目说了喝茶多
的日本人胃癌和肺癌的发病率较低，A 选项说日本人抽烟比美国人多，而且抽烟是导致肺癌
的原因之一，但是实际上日本人的肺癌发病率比较低，这就说明茶叶中的polypheonols 是
能够预防癌症的。 
 
Passage260 
 
1. 答案：E 
 
解析：事实信息题。对应文章这一句话：Whether the occasional presence of geometric rugs 
in similar paintings after the 1440s。也就是已经证明了E 选项的正确性：after the 1440s, 
Timurid paintings of court scenes sometimes showed rugs with geometric patterns。 
 
2. 答案：BC 
 
解析：A 错误，并没有解释the absence of any surviving geometric-patterned rugs。B 选项
正确，文章说了1440s 就已经开始出现loral-patterned rugs，早于painter Behzād。C 选项
和B 选项是道理一样的，对应文章这句话：floral-patterned rugs were already being used at 


 
 
that time. 也证明它比学者认为的要早出现。 
 
3. 答案：D 
 
解析：句子作用题。划线句子是文章最后一句，最后一句提出了一个不确定的问题，所以
indirect evidence 很好地对应了最后一句话的作用。 
 
4. 答案：E 
 
解析：从文章最后一句话可以看出这里的formula= 上面的pattern ，所以选项中
recipe=pattern，都有方法的意思。 
 
Passage 261 
 
解析：逻辑推理题中的削弱题。要找到文中逻辑链条的薄弱点。文章中说，十六世纪的
艺术史学家瓦萨里（Vasari）仅在亲自看过建筑物或建筑物的详细模型时才写关于建筑
物的文章。第二版《 Vasari 艺术家的生活》中对Larcona 新教堂的详尽描述一定是其他
人的贡献，因为该版本是在Vasari 出差将他带到Larcona 的前一年出版的，此外，瓦萨
里的家佛罗伦萨也没有展出过该教堂的模型。 
 
答案：B 
文章的推理有个薄弱点，根据后面两个理由“Vasari 没去过Larcona”和“Vasari 没在
自己家乡见过L 的教堂”推断出V 没见过L 的教堂，从而得出对L 教堂的描写并非V 本
人完成的结论。B 选项削弱了推理过程。B 指出L 教堂的模型曾在V 经常旅游的城市
ROME 展出过，也就是说，V 是有可能见过L 的。 
  
Passage 262 
 
解析：现象解释型文章。文章一开始提出一个观点，“设定保护目标通常会将科学知识
与政治可行性结合在一起，以至于人们无法分辨科学在哪里停止，政治实用主义接管了。”
后面指出的Tear 的一个发现，对于具有恢复计划的濒危物种，超过四分之一的计划将
定量恢复目标设定在或低于该物种的现有种群规模或种群数量。然后提出两种解释：1，
这些目标很低，因为它们在政治上是令人愉悦的。2，另一种可能的解释是所谓的
Shifting-baseline 综合症。在这种情况下，连续几代的野生动植物管理者都将其职业生
涯开始时所经历的条件作为基准，从而导致对每一代新一代的期望都降低了。 
 
1.答案E。词汇题  
考察对modest 的理解。根据such 定位前一句，these objectives were so low，也就是
作者认为目标过低了。五个选项中，unambitious 最符合上下文含义。 
 


 
 
2. 答案D。 
根据关键词shifting-baseline syndrome 定位到最后一句resulting in 前面“In this 
scenario, successive generations of wildlife managers use as their baseline the conditions 
they experienced at the start of their careers”这句话。D 选项是这句话的同义改写。 
A 错，不在定位区间。 
B 错，无中生有。 
C 错，后半句中的used in determining whether a given quantitative objective has been 
met 无中生有。 
E 错，无中生有。 
 
Passage 263 
 
解析：逻辑推理题。要求找出Low bone density 和stroke 之间的联系。文章中提到，骨
密度低的人，中风的发生率明显高于平均水平。就像有高血压的人一样。众所周知，高
血压可以导致中风，但由于极少有任何机制证明低骨密度可导致中风，反之亦然，因此，
一种可能的假说可以解释骨密度低和中风的关系是_____。 
答案：C。there is a condition that can cause both low bone density and strokes 提出了
另外一种可能，低骨密度和中风并没有因果关系，而可能由某一种条件同时导致。 
ABCE 均与文章的推理无关。题目要找的是Low bone density 和stroke 之间的联系。 
 
Passage264 
 
解析：逻辑推理削弱题。文章指出，托雷利亚国立大学约有20％的教授未在Torellia 学
习。在Torellia 受过教育的大学教授的平均薪资相比那些在Torellia 以外接受过教育，而
培训和经验水平相当的教授而言，低大约10％。由此作者得出结论，在确定薪资时，存
在一种未成文的政策，但该政策偏向于受外国教育的教授而不是在Torellia 受教育的教
授。找到文章的逻辑链条后，找他因削弱。 
 
答案：B。 
B 选项给出了另一个原因：该大学的商学院大多数的教授在Torellia 以外受教育，而他
们必须向其教师支付高薪，才能与公司提供给他们的薪水竞争。（与University policy 无
关） 
ACDE 均不能削弱原文的逻辑推理。 
 
Passage265 
 
解析：这是一篇文学分析评论。针对于HM 写的《政治经济学插图》，作者首先提到它
是一本关于工业家和工人的教学小说，在其出版（1832-1834）时受到极大欢迎，被认


 
 
为是第一代工业小说。但是，他们没有像其他工业小说那样，将受苦的个人放在显著地
位，而是拥护那些决定个人行为的经济法则。HM 的明确目标是说服读者，使他们相信
托马斯·马尔萨斯（Thomas Malthus）这样的经济哲学家提出的原则的真实性。然而，中
篇小说对预定真理的拥抱削弱了它们的叙事力。他们声称是“illustration”，其中人类
的故事仅仅是为了让抽象的法则更加生动，这违背了大多数现实主义小说中抽象法则与
生活经验之间的关系，在这些现实主义小说中，前者是不足以解释后者的。 
 
1.答案A。推理题，根据选项定位到文章首句。 
Harriet Martineau’s Illustrations of Political Economy, a series of didactic novellas about 
industrialists and workers that were immensely popular upon their publication (1832-
1834), are considered the first industrial novels. HM 的小说被认为是第一代，那么题干
中问的，之后的小说，就是文章下一句提到的But instead of foregrounding suffering 
individuals, as other industrial novels do。后面小说的特征就是：foregrounding suffering 
individuals。从而得出答案A。 
B 错，无中生有。 
C 错，逻辑错误，more directly concerned with abstract economic laws than with the 
experiences of individuals 是HM 的特征，而不是后面的这些人。 
D 错，比较级无中生有。 
E 错，无中生有。 
 
2.答案：C。信息目的题。 
根据关键词Thomas Malthus 定位到原文Martineau’s explicit aim is to convince her 
readers of the truth of the principles laid out by such economic philosophers as Thomas 
Malthus。TM 是M 文章中提到的economic philosophers 之一。 
C 是正确选项。作者提到这个人，是为了帮助解释M 的intention。 
A 错，这个选项的意思是“作者提到了M 文章中，会让其生动的一个特征”，这跟作者
的观点正好相反。 
B 错，这个选项意思是“厘清了M 小说中一个被人poorly understand 的部分。”这也
并非是作者提到这个人时的目的。 
D 和E 都是无中生有。 
 
Passage266 
 
解析：观点点评文章。Nielsen 认为，对于许多读者，包括教科书的编撰者来说，非裔美
国文学被认为在风格上主要是现实主义的，在内容上主要是社会学或政治学的。除了一
些明显例子之外，前卫的表达方式常常被忽视。然后作者进一步指出，虽然这种狭隘的
观点在批评小说时比批评诗歌时更为明显，但它确实扭曲了anthologies。Nielsen 敏锐
地意识到这些汇编背后的严重政治动机，也担心目前流行的这种对oral tradition 的文学


 
 
批评范式（这里指的就是文章首句提到的“现实主义”）可能会转移对非裔美国人文学
传统的适当关注。 
 
1.答案：D。推理题。 
根据题干定位回原文While such a narrow view is more readily apparent in critical 
attention given to fiction than in that given to poetry...While 后面是作者让步的部分，也
就是作者认为narrow view 在poetry 身上没有那么明显，对应D。 
AB 错，比较级的无中生有。 
C 错，非定位区间。 
E 错，比较级的无中生有。 
 
2，答案：B。多选题。 
根据题干关键词定位到原文Nielsen is also concerned that the currently popular critical 
paradigm of an oral tradition might deflect proper attention due African American literary 
traditions. 作者认为前文提到的这种（偏现实主义，忽略先锋派的文学评论）可能会转
移对非裔美国人文学传统的适当关注。B 选项focus on a particular type of literature at 
the expense of other types 是这句话的同义改写。 
A 错，非定位区间。 
C 错，逻辑错误。the anthologies give insufficient attention to the oral tradition 与原文
最后一句相反。原文认为对Oral tradition 的关注，会转移对literary tradition 的关注。 
 
Passage 267 
 
解析：观点点评。文章先提出，一般大家都认为是单向的continent-island 模式，也就
是说，island population 都来自于continent。但后文提出，有证据证明island-continent
模式也是存在的。 
我们理所当然地认为，island population 必须来自continent，而不是相反。从一个更大
的岛屿上获得其生物群（即动植物）的岛屿数量（之多）支持这一观点。然而，在平衡
理论中，并没有基本的机制可以阻止岛屿物种可以占据大陆的生物地理学理论（也就是
先有island 物种）。文章后面又从两方面的证据，来说明这个观点（island-continent）。 
 
1.答案：B。 
根据关键词定位到原文，There is, however, no fundamental mechanism in the equilibrium 
theory of island bio geography to preclude island species from colonizing the mainland. 
也就是说，平衡理论认为这个是双向的。island 也可以colonize mainland。同义改写就
是B 选项。 
ACD 错，这都是关于文章一开始观点“continent-island”的表述。 
E 错，文章中没有提到，无中生有。 


 
 
 
2，选择一句话，代表预设观点。 
原文中的第一句话：We take for granted that island populations must have a continental 
origin, and not the other way around.  
 
Passage268 
 
解析：这篇文章讨论的是temperance movement（禁酒运动）地位。文章一开始提到，
19 世纪美国最大的妇女运动和最大的女演说家团体都在参与禁酒运动。尽管这些妇女
生产的材料数量之多足以引起重视，但她们的重要性绝不仅仅是数量上的。尽管她们缺
乏正式的修辞训练，但她们对自己文化背景下的语言使用表现出了非凡的理解，并就自
己的目的和所涉及的受众展示了非常有效的修辞策略。尽管禁酒积极分子在创造变革方
面取得了成功，但是二十世纪的女权主义者倾向于把选举权运动作为妇女唯一重要的政
治活动。这一疏忽导致了妇女参与政治进程的扭曲。 
 
1.答案：E。考察的是对critical 这个单词的理解。 
通过上下文可以知道，作者对参与temperance movement 的19 世界的妇女们是持赞赏
态度的，认为她们justififies critical attention。由此可得出critical 在这里不是批评的意
思，而是另一个含义“重要的”。选E。 
 
2.答案：B。推理题。 
根据题干中关键词 temperance movement’s audiences 定位回原文：Although they 
lacked formal rhetorical training, these women exhibited an exceptional understanding 
of language use within their cultural context and demonstrated  
remarkably effective rhetorical strategies in relation to their own purposes and the 
audiences they addressed. 也就是作者认为，这些women 在表达自己的目的和与受众
之间的沟通是非常有效的。由此可以推出B 选项。“They were often persuaded by the 
speeches they heard by women temperance orators.” 
ACDE 文中都没有相关细节，无中生有。 
 
Passage 269 
 
解析：逻辑单题，削弱题。要求找出文中推理的漏洞。最近有人发现，一家学术期刊的
编辑拒绝了一篇提交出版的论文，尽管专家评论员强烈推荐了这篇论文。编辑们说，他
们担心对这篇论文可能产生的政治反应。这一令人遗憾的事件表明，许多人长期以来所
怀疑的是事实：这家学术期刊通常是基于政治而非学术考虑而拒绝发表论文。 
答案：D。此题较简单。段落前面说了拒绝了一篇论文，后面却推理到 routinely 。答案 
D : relies on a single example to establish a general claim 指出了这个问题。 


 
 
 
Passage270 
 
解析：逻辑题，假设题。 
一年前，波特兰市政府预测，T 市下一年将出现强劲的净就业增长，但波特兰的另一个
主要城市G 不会。然而，事实清楚地证明，事实并非如此；在T 市，而不是G，失业人
数比一年前还要多。原文的证据是，T 市失业人数比一年前多了，得出的结论：T 市没
有出现净就业增长。 
 
答案：D。ASSUMPTION 的做题套路之一：将选项取非之后，看是否会削弱原文结论。
D 选项取非之后，“有一些unemployed people 在过去的一年从G 市搬到了T 市”，
这就可以削弱原文推理的链条。 
A 错，文章主要讨论的是T 市的问题。 
B 错，取非之后，The unemployment rate in T City is not higher now than it has ever 
been. 文章讨论的是从去年到今年这个一年的区间，这个取非后并不能削弱结论。 
CE 错，都是无关选项。 
 
Passage271 
 
解析：逻辑题，削弱题。 
在一项对冠心病患者进行的为期五年的研究中，85%服用A 药的患者在研究结束时还活
着。A 药是一种治疗冠心病的新药。由于没有A 药，这一人群中只有75%的人预计能活
满5 年，因此A 药在延长冠心病患者的生命方面显然是有效的。 
答案： A 。直接削弱原因。文章中说了 A 药是有用的，因为 85 ％服用的患者活着，
但是 A 选项中，研究结束时， 85％接受安慰剂（一种医学上无效但无害的药丸）而非 
A 药治疗的受试者仍然活着。也就是说，安慰剂也有效果，并不一定是 A 药的效果。  
B 错， fund 的来源并不能直接反驳结论。  
C 错，“这项研究不包括那些在研究开始时冠心病已经严重到不能活超过一年的人。”
这个因素的存在与原文的逻辑推理无关。  
D 错，提出外科手术，也与原文逻辑推理无关。  
E 错，无关选项。 
 
Passage272 
 
解析：文艺复兴时期艺术家的writings 常常因其能展示艺术家的生活和个性而受到珍视。
尽管米开朗基罗和多纳泰罗的寿命几乎相等，艺术作品也同样令人印象深刻，但米开朗
基罗因为现存writings 的丰富多彩，比多纳泰罗更易于让人了解。其他一些现在不太被
欣赏的艺术家，如岑尼诺岑尼尼，对于现代历史学家来说，他们的writings 比他们的绘


 
 
画作品更有价值。然而，达芬奇是一个“悖论”。达芬奇留下了数千页的文字。这些文
本被分类研究，将他的作品分成更小的组，如绘画、科学、解剖学、光学和工程学。然
而，尽管这一方法得到了详尽的应用，作为一个个体，他仍然完全不为人所知。 
 
1.答案：A。信息目的题。 
根据达芬奇定位回原文，作者是在The great paradox,  
however, 之后提到达芬奇的，因此这个例子，就是为了证明这个paradox 的存在。A 选
项note an exception 是同义改写。 
根据定位，BCDE 均可排除。 
 
2.答案：D。问的是高亮句作用。高亮句用米开朗基罗举例，为的是说明前一句的观点，
Writings by Renaissance artists are often prized for the light they can shed on artists’ 
lives and personalities.  因此D 正确。 
A 错，逻辑错误，与原文相反。 
B 错在account for，这个例子的目的不是为了解释一种学术倾向，而是对这种学术倾向
举例子详细说明，illustration 更合适。 
CE 中的contrast 和distinction，都不是高亮句的目的。 
 
Passage273 
 
解析：北极海冰属于两类。季节性冰在冬天结冰，然后在夏天溶解，而多年生冰则终年
持续存在。对未经训练的人来说，所有的海冰看起来都是一样的，但是只要舔一舔，就
可以评估一块特定的冰块漂浮了多长时间。当冰开始在海水中形成时，它驱赶出盐，盐
在晶体结构中没有位置。 随着冰层变厚，废盐会聚集在小袋的盐水中，浓的盐浓度过
高而无法冻结。第一年的冰块很咸。最后，如果冰仍然存在，那么这些盐水就会通过细
小的静脉状的通道流失，冰会变得更新鲜。多年的冰甚至可以溶解和被饮用。 
 
1.答案：AC。多选题。 
根据题目seasonal ice 定位到原文，all sea ice looks the same, but by licking it, one can 
evaluate how long a specific piece has been floating round. 对应A 和C 选项。 
B 错误，这是多年生冰的特征，而不是季节性冰。 
 
2.答案：E。词汇题。此处考察的是熟词僻义。根据上下文，fine 在这里与veinlike 并列，
用来形容Channels，可推出在这里指“细小的”，选E。 
 
Passage274 
 
解析：小说乔治（Georges），以D 的名字出版，实际上可能是M 写的。乔治这本小说


 
 
与著名的D 小说的比较表明，D 与乔治没有任何关系。举例来说，乔治的人物真诚而又
令人生厌，而D 著名小说中那些人物则爱开玩笑。同时，从技术上讲，乔治写的很完美，
而Count of Monte Cristo 在充满活力和光芒的同时，到处都是重复和不拘一格。正如翁
贝托·艾考（Umberto Eco）在尝试翻译Count of Monte Cristo 时所发现的那样，D 小说
的魅力和其“叙事智慧”与它的“语言上的污秽和大喘气”密不可分。 
 
1.答案：E。 
根据Dumas as a novelist 定位，文中在两个地方提到了D 的小说特征。those from Dumas’ 
well-known novels crack jokes and utter colorful oaths. Meanwhile, in a technical 
sense, ...with all its verve and sparkle, is full of redundancies, repetitions, and non sequiturs.  
E 选项中说的narrative skill 对应“verve and sparkle”，certain technical flaws 对应 
“ full of redundancies, repetitions, and non sequiturs”。 
 
A 错：distract 跟原文的意思正好相反。 
B 错：overrated 文中没有提到。 
C 错：无中生有。 
D 错：predictable plots 无中生有。 
 
2.答案：B。 
根据关键词定位回原文，B 选项“Its characters are less interesting than those in most 
Dumas novels.”是文中“Georges’ characters are tiresomely earnest, while those from 
Dumas’ well-known novels crack jokes and utter colorful oaths. ”的同义改写。 
A 错：无中生有。 
C 错：redundancies, repetitions, and non sequiturs 是D 小说的特征。 
D 错：无中生有。 
E 错：无中生有。 
 
Passage 275 
 
解析：在员工限制允许的范围内，进口到Bornland 的药品要进行质量检查。在过去的
几年中，经检查发现有缺陷的货运比例一直保持在25％左右。 今年，检查人员和检查
人员的数量增加了一倍，只有21％的比例有缺陷。显然，进口到Bornland 的药品质量
已大大提高。 
 
答案：B。逻辑单题的“变种”。找到文中推理链条，然后看哪个选项符合。 
B 选项中，新雇佣的检验人员如果可以和之前更有经验的检察人员一样好的话，这个推
理就成立；反之，推理不成立。 
ACDE 均为无关选项。 


 
 
 
Passage 276 
 
解析：在研究不同大小的蚁群时，C 发现当提供的空间中只有几只蚂蚁时，每个蚂蚁都
表现出混乱的活动和休息模式。随着添加更多蚂蚁而增加了colony 的密度，C 观察到了
一个突然的转变，转向了秩序：整个colony 的活动和休息模式突然从混乱变为有节奏。 
为什么蚂蚁的密度在从混沌行为向有序行为的转变中起着至关重要的作用？ 蚂蚁彼此
互动，而一只活动的蚂蚁遇到不活动的蚂蚁会刺激后者运动。在低密度时，蚂蚁之间很
少遇到，但在高密度时，活动可以像传染病一样在colony 传播。 
 
1.答案：AB。多选题。 
根据ant interactions 定位，Ants interact with one another, and an active ant encountering 
an inactive one will stimulate the latter into movement. At low densities there are few 
encounters, but at higher densities activity can spread like a contagion through the colony. 
前面一句对应A，后面一句对应B。 
C 错，无中生有。 
 
2.答案C 。词汇题。 
根据上下文的意思，这里的ordered 与chaotic 取反，C 选项regular 最符合。 
 
Passage 277 
 
解析：Argiope 物种的蜘蛛在其网中建立了独特的锯齿状图案，称为S。 最近的研究已
经确定，Argiope 蜘蛛使用S 来收集饮用水。这一发现并没有抹杀长期以来关于S 起到
增强web 作用的假说，实际上支持了它，因为________。 
 
答案：D。逻辑单题。 
正确答案必然是为什么S 支持了之前的假说，寻找两者关联点。 
答案D“设计用来收集水而不是洒水的蜘蛛网，在结构上必须比洒水的蜘蛛网更结实”，
也就说明了，这些用来收集水的S 设计，起到了增强web 的作用。 
ABCE 均是无关选项，与文中推理无关。 
 
Passage 278 
 
解析：一个研究小组声称，通过在地球表面以下进行钻探，他们能够复原居住在以前认
为没有生命的深度的微生物。尽管其他一些起初被认为是从这些深度中复原的微生物，
后来确定仅来自表层土壤，但在这种情况下却并非如此，因为________。 
 


 
 
答案：A。逻辑题。给原文的逻辑链条补上一环。 
A 选项 被这些研究人员发现的某些微生物无法生活在表面附近。补上了“在这种情况
下却并非如此”这一个链条。 
B 错，根据B 得出的结论，与原文结论正好相反。 
C 错，contamination 无关选项。 
D 错，无关选项。 
E 错，无关选项。 
 
Passage 279 
 
解析：1753 年11 月，英国作家Sarah Fielding 收到了小说《哭泣》的一半款项，并要
求另一半给她“或者由我指定的任何人”，这可能意味着剩余部分是给其他某人的。实
际上，许多人认为这本小说是Fielding 和Jane Collier 合作的作品。这种特殊的合作非
常可能，因为她们是两个志趣相投的密友。她们写了共同撰写的信，都对彼此的作品充
满兴趣，并且是小说中说教论和创新的热情支持者，这也是《哭泣》的核心关注点。但
是，与F 同时代的人仅将作品授权给F，在这部小说中，没有什么与F 的其他著作不相
容。 
 
1.答案：ABC。多选题。 
根据题目定位到原文This specific collaboration was likely enough, as the two were close 
friends with similar interests. They wrote jointly authored letters, were both published 
authors with a lively interest in each other’s work, and were passionate supporters of 
didacticism and innovation in fiction—core concerns of The Cry.  
得出ABC 均为正确答案。 
 
2. 答案：B。 推理题。 
根据题干关键信息Cry 定位回原文：didacticism and innovation in fiction—core concerns 
of The Cry. B 选项It reflects an interest in the purposes to which fiction may be put.就是
这句话的同义改写。 
A 错，无中生有。 
C 错，逻辑错误，与原文相反。 
D 错，无中生有。 
E 错，Parts of it... 无中生有，文中并没有相关的确切描述。 
 
Passage280 
 
解析：月球曾经有一个磁场，而火星在其早期也有一个磁场，但目前这两个物体都没有
磁场。但是水星，它的大小在月球和火星之间，有一个活跃而相对较强的磁场。行星科


 
 
学家认为行星需要一个液态核来维持这样的磁场，但是行星越小，冷却得越快。水星的
核心应该和月球一样冰冷和死气沉沉，但它的磁场持续存在。这可能是由于硫等元素的
存在，当它与铁混合，降低熔点，保持芯熔化。 
 
1.答案：A。 
这道题问的是，作者说到水星时是基于什么说“by all right”的。据此找到原文，Mercury, 
by all right, should have a core as cold and dead as the Moon’s.由should 得知，by all 
right 的基础在前一句，也就是作者讨论的“the smaller the planet, the faster it cools. ”
因此A 选项的size 正确。 
 
2.答案：B。词汇题。 
根据上下文，dead 此处与cold 并列，指的是被冷冻住了。B 最佳选项，inert 没有活动
的。C 不对，dormant 一般指的是火山爆发前的沉寂状态。 
 
Passage281 
 
解析：关于V 的起源，专家们意见不一。由于大多数现存的物种生活在澳大利亚，早期
的研究人员认为，V 起源于澳大利亚，随后向西沿印度-澳大利亚群岛跳跃。爬虫学家M
后来认为V 可能起源于群岛。此后，染色体分析支持了梅尔滕斯的论点。此外，地质证
据还提到V 起源后群岛和澳大利亚大陆之间的碰撞——这一事实可以解释该属目前的
分布。对科学家来说，一个相关的难题是目前V 现存最大的物种K 的分布。科学家指
出，这些食肉动物只生活在群岛上的四个小岛上，那里的猎物基数太小，无法支撑哺乳
动物的食肉动物。但K 最近被发现比哺乳动物食肉动物更有效地控制体温，使其能够依
靠相当大小的哺乳动物食肉动物所需的大约十分之一的食物能量生存。 
 
1. 答案：D。 
根据Komodo dragon 定位到原文第二段。A relevant puzzle...These carnivores inhabited 
only on four small islands 可以得出他们的居住地是更受限制的，D 是正确答案。 
AB 错在无中生有。文中没有提到when researchers first began investigating the origins 
of the genus Varanus 时，K 是什么样的。 
C 错，逻辑错误。与原文相反。 
E 错，区间错误，这是第一段的内容。 
 
2. 答案：A。 
根据debate over the origin of Varanus 定位到第一段。BCDE 的信息，在第一段中都有
提到了。对应B 的是“Since most existing species live in Australia, early researchers 
believed that Varanus originated in Australia”，对应C 的是“subsequently island 
hopped westward along the Indo-Australian archipelago”，对应D 的是“geological 


 
 
evidence refers to a crash between the archipelago and the Australian landmass after 
Varanus originated—a fact that could account for the genus’ present distribution.” 对
应E 的是“most existing species live in Australia”。而A 选项中，The evidence that led 
Mertens to argue 在文中没有出现。文章只是提到 Herpetologist Robert Mertens later 
argued that Varanus possibly originated in the archipelago. 并没有说是什么让他得出这
个观点。后面的Chromosomal analysis 只是给他的这个观点提出了support，并不是让
M 得出这个观点的evidence 
 
3. 答案：B。 
推理题。根据geological evidence 定位到“and additionally, geological evidence refers 
to a crash between the archipelago and the Australian landmass after Varanus 
originated—a fact that could account for the genus’ present distribution.”可见，这个
evidence 是可以解释V 现有的分布。B 正确，因为尽管这个evidence could account for 
the genus’ present distribution，但It cannot rule out either one of the theories about 
the origins of Varanus discussed in the Passage.文中最后也没有说哪个theory 正确。 
A 错，无中生有。 
C 错，非定位区间。 
D 错，无中生有。 
E 错，early researchers 错误。 
 
Passage282 
 
解析：对于寻找适合新巢址的岩石裂缝的T 蚂蚁来说，大小是一个重要的考虑因素，某
些行为表明了侦察员是如何比较几个巢址大小的。进入缝隙后，侦察员总是退出并重新
进入。在他们的第一次检查中，他们用他们的个人信息素标记他们的路线。（实验表明，
工蚁可以将自己的信息素与巢友的信息素区分开。）一些研究人员认为，这些蚂蚁正在
计算两条探索性路径交叉的频率。面积越小，他们越有可能两次穿过一个地点。有人观
察到，T 蚂蚁的侦察队在第一次去现场时总是铺出一条相同长度的道路，这有力地支持
了这一假设。 
 
1. 答案：B。题目问的是researcher 的观点，定位回原文：“Some researchers believe 
that these ants are counting the frequency of intersections between their two exploratory 
trails”。研究者researchers 的观点是根据前一句推出来的，they mark their route with 
their personal pheromones. B 正确，“这种能力有助于在巢的不同成员之间分配特定的
轨迹，如寻找新巢。”对应文中的frequency of intersections between their two 
exploratory trails。 
 
A 错，后半段无中生有。 


 
 
C 错，太绝对，would not be able to 文中没有提到。 
D 错，非定位区间。 
E 错，逻辑错误。 
 
2.答案：A。句子作用题。 
由句子中“strongly supports this hypothesis.”可知，这句话是为了支持researcher 观
点的。A 选项It clarifies the relationship 正确。 
B 错，offers a hypothesis 错误。这个句子里没有hypothesis，而是observation。 
C 错，attempt to reconcile 无中生有。 
DE 错，challenge 和undermine 无中生有。 
 
Passage283 
 
解析：如果一颗超新星（一颗大质量恒星的爆炸）从稠密的气体和尘埃云中触发恒星形
成，而且，如果从云中形成的最大质量恒星演化成一颗超新星并触发新一轮恒星形成，
如此，就会形成一系列恒星形成区域。如果许多这样的星系链在一个不同的旋转星系中
形成，那么恒星的分布将类似于在一个旋涡星系中观察到的分布。 
这一推论为一个令人兴奋的螺旋星系结构这一新理论奠定了基础。基于这一理论的计算
机模拟再现了许多螺旋星系的外观，而没有假设底层密度波，后者是螺旋星系大尺度结
构最广为接受的理论的标志。这一理论认为，螺旋状的密度波会扫过星系的中心平面，
压缩气体和尘埃云，这些气体和尘埃会坍缩成螺旋状的恒星。 
 
1.答案：D。主旨目的题。 
文章首段提出一个理论，二段没有转折，继续说明了这个理论削弱了之前的一个density 
wave 的理论。D 选项前句对应第一段，后半句对应第二段，是最正确的。 
A 错，这是首段提到的一个小细节。 
B 错，选项中“propose a modification”无中生有。原文只是说了新理论中没有density 
wave，但并没有对这个理论提出修正。 
C 错，无中生有。 
E 错，inferior 无中生有。 
 
2.答案：E。 
根据关键词new theory of spiral-galaxy structure 和spiral galaxy 定位到第一段最后一句
If many such chains were created in a differentially rotating galaxy, the distribution of 
stars would resemble the observed distribution in a spiral galaxy. E 是正确答案。 
ABD 错在，定位区间不对，density wave 和central plane of a galaxy 都是第二段信息。 
C 错，不在定位区间。 
 


 
 
3.答案：C。相当于削弱题。 
根据new theory 定位到第一段，这个新理论的存在，取决于段首两个IF 的成立。答案
C 削弱了第二个IF 的内容，因此是正确答案。 
ABDE 均为无关选项。 
 
Passage284 
 
解析：十七世纪中叶，殖民地新英格兰的一些美洲原住民开始根据自己的文化优先权和
兴趣，第一次饲养和管理牲畜。有几个因素影响了他们饲养动物的决定，包括对他们的
土地基础和狩猎生产力的威胁。欧洲人的畜牧业似乎给印第安人带来了不可逾越的社会
文化挑战。研究这一问题的学者认为，家畜会损害冬季狩猎所需的流动性，毁坏庄稼，
与野生动物争夺资源，并违反普遍存在的财产观念和人与动物相互联系的观念。这些障
碍确实很难克服，但克服这些障碍的创造性方法被找到了。  
 
1. 答案：E。句子作用题。 
作者在文章一开始讨论了原住民开始饲养和管理牲畜的原因。高亮句为“Scholars 
studying the issue have argued that livestock would have compromised the mobility 
needed for winter hunting, destroyed crops, competed with wild game for resources, and 
violated prevailing conceptions of property and of human-animal interconnectedness.”
这里，scholars 提出的是障碍，但作者的观点是，这些障碍被克服了。因此，高亮句的
作用是 identifies certain challenges，正确答案为E。 
A 错，atypical scholarly viewpoint 无中生有。 
B 错， animal husbandry was not adopted by more Native Americans 无中生有。 
C 错，typical misconceptions 不对。作者同意这些障碍，因此，不是misconception。 
D 错， ultimately transformed 逻辑错误。这些障碍最后被克服了。 
 
2. 答案：A。多选题+推断题。 
根据题干定位回原文。A 选项可定位到：animal husbandry as practiced by Europeans 
would have posed an insurmountable sociocultural challenge for Indians. 这句话是
required cultural adjustment 的同义改写。 
 
BC 错，文中没有对应。 
 
Passage285 
 
解析：分析舞蹈的物理学可以从根本上提高舞者的技巧。尽管舞蹈演员很少完全用物理
术语来看待自己——因为身体在众所周知的力量的影响下在空间中移动，并且遵守物理
规律，但他们也不能忽视运动的物理。例如，无论一个舞者多么想跳下地板然后开始转


 
 
身，角动量守恒定律绝对阻止了这种运动。 
 
一些主要涉及身体整体的垂直或水平运动的运动，其中可以忽略旋转，可以用三维线性
运动的简单方程来研究。然而，旋转运动需要更复杂的方法，包括分析身体质量的分布
方式，不同类型运动中涉及的旋转轴，以及产生旋转运动的力的来源。 
 
1.答案：E。 
根据题干关键词定位，文中两段都提到了“understanding of the physics of dance”，A
选项对应第一段末尾，BD 选项对应第二段末尾，C 选项对应第二段段首。只有E 选项
在文中没有提及。 
 
2 ．答案： C 。  
题目要找的是“哪一种动作需要用到最后一句复杂的方法来研究”。这道题类似于推断
题和类比题。文中第二段讨论的是 rotational motions，在五个选项中，只有 C 符合对 
rotational motions 的描述。  
ABCE 都没有旋转的动作。 
 
Passage286 
 
解析：提高汽车燃料税最可信的理由是，燃料消耗减少了环境（污染），从而增加了交通
拥堵的成本。但是，燃烧燃料会产生这些“副作用”的事实，并不意味着燃料税永远不
会太高。经济学对应该征收的税收是准确的，原则上，税收应该保持与“副作用”的平
衡：一公升燃料的税收应该等于使用一公升燃料所造成的损害。如果税收不止这些，它
的成本（包括给那些本来宁愿使用汽车的人带来的不便）将超过它的收益（包括减少交
通堵塞和污染）。 
 
1.答案：A。词汇题。 
此处exceed 相当于本意“超过”，最合适的选项是A。 
其余四个选项都没有这个意思。 
 
2.答案：E。 
这道题问“以下哪一项最能体现文章所指部分的功能”？（这道题高亮句没有体现出来，
应该是But the fact that burning fuel generates these “negative externalities” does not 
indicate that no tax on fuel could ever be too high.这一句） 
BUT 这句带出的是作者的观点，“燃烧燃料会产生这些副作用的事实，并不意味着燃料
税永远不会太高。” 
A 错，这句话提出的是与前一句的justification 相反的观点，不是restate。 
B 错，evidence 与theory 都是无中生有。 


 
 
C 错，specific application 无中生有。 
D 错，总结了一个justification，这应该是文章第一句的功能。 
正确答案是E 选项。a particular strategy 就是tax 的同义改写。 
 
Passage287 
答案：E 
解析：survey results 的意思是不相信别人和高估犯罪的人主要是那些喜欢看电视的人。
要削弱这个support，那么选项必须说不相信别人和高估犯罪的人不是那些喜欢看电视
的人，所以E 选项最合适，因为E 选项的意思是“那些不相信别人容易怀疑犯罪的人反
而是喜欢看电视的人”，这样就把因果关系否认了。A 选项有干扰性，A 选项说很多不
相信别人高估犯罪的人都不看电视，但是这个选项没有说明到底是不是因为看电视导致
的不相信别人，高估犯罪。所以A 选项不对。 
 
Passage288 
 
解析：从第二次世界大战以来，平面设计才被归类为一个值得了解和保存的领域，而且
大多数设计收藏都被狭义地定义了。现存的广告档案寥寥无几，有些设计藏品仅包括老
牌艺术家的政治海报，其他藏品则侧重于选举等特定的历史文献海报。像这样严格定义
的集合可以培养设计历史的分类概念。相比之下，BERMAN 作为一名收藏家的雄心勃勃
——包括先锋图形、匿名政治海报和商业广告——保留了广泛的图形，以展示图形设计
是如何在一种文化中渗透的，不是彼此孤立而是与日常意义和视觉刺激混合在一起。 
 
答案：A。高亮句目的题。 
高亮句是作者对前一句的评价，因此，A 选项“提供了对前一句的评论”是正确选项。 
B 错，question 错误，没有转折。 
C 错，not important before...无中生有。 
D 错，informed Berman’s early career 无中生有。 
E 错，against 错误。作者并没有否定Berman。 
 
Passage289 
 
十九世纪初，对声音要求越来越高，导致钢琴琴弦的张力越来越大，这表明需要更有力
的框架。迟早，在工厂接管了其他商品的生产之后，工业革命仍然塑造了那些决定是否
接受这种创新的人的态度。建造使用蒸汽动力工具的钢琴是一回事，将铸铁框架放在乐
器的中心，使产品本身成为一个现代的声音工厂，而不是完全手工制作的木制艺术品，
是另一回事。由此引发的争论是激烈的，许多人认为钢琴里的铁会破坏音调。 
 
1. AC。答案：多选题。 


 
 
根据development of the piano，定位回原文。 
A 对应文中第一句话，“During the early nineteenth century...making evident the need 
for stronger framing.”对应后面的描述，说明直到19 世纪初，钢琴一直都不是由工厂
生产的，而是made by artisans。 
C 对应文中后半段，“To build pianos with steam-powered tools was one thing...making 
the product itself a modern factory of sound rather than a fully handcrafted artwork, in 
wood, was quite another. ”说明在工业革命之前，都是由wood 制造的。 
B 错，文中说的是iron 会导致a decline in tone quality，而不是steam-powered tools。 
 
2.C。词汇题。 
Timbre 是音色的意思，这道题容易误选D。pitch 是指音高，在这里并不符合文意。 
 
Passage290 
 
解析：事实上，每一个说T 语的人都生活在T 国，一个以其独特文化为荣的小国。然而，
由于T 与许多其他国家进行贸易，居住在T 国的大多数人会说几种语言，而且T 的公立
学校教授许多语言。然而，根据这些事实，不应推断，会说T 语的大多数人会讲几种语
言，因为________。 
 
答案：C。逻辑单题。 
此题可以反推。题目给出了三个条件，1，每个说T 语的人都生活在T 国，2，由于T 与
许多其他国家进行贸易，因此居住在居住在T 国的大多数人会说几种语言，3，T 的公立
学校教授许多语言。题目要求填空，但是也可以当做削弱题来做。如果结论是“会说T
语的大多数人会讲几种语言”，那么，哪个选项最能削弱结论？ 
A 错，与原文推理链条无关。 
B 错，“在世界上所有会说几种语言的人中，只有一小部分人会说T 语”。并不能削弱。 
C 对，“住在T 国的人里，几乎没有人真的说T 语。”说T 语的人很少，因此，不能推
断出“会说T 语的大多数人会讲几种语言”。 
D 错，无关选项。 
E 错，T 公立学校教授的一些语言在与T 贸易的任何国家都不讲。无关选项。 
 
Passage291 
 
解析：在20 世纪20 年代，大多数科学管理（T 的方法）的支持者，通过密集的例行工
作，最大限度地提高工人的生产力。他们对抗五天工作周。尽管科学管理者承认减少工
作时间可能会激励员工，但实际上，他们更经常利用薪酬差异来鼓励提高生产力。那些
既想接受科学管理，又想缩短工作时间的改革者不得不提出一个非常消极的理由，把后
者描述为对前者严厉的解毒剂。在与科学管理者的冲突中，F 说，较短的工作时间可以


 
 
提高生产率和利润。然而，很少有雇主能与F 的愿景或他在大规模营销（汽车）中的特
殊兴趣符合，这种产品要求有闲暇时间使用，也很少有工会通过谈判成功地节省了较短
的工作时间。在1928 年的大会上，美国联邦劳工组织（AFL）吹嘘说，大约有165000
名成员每周工作5 天40 小时。但尽管这意味着自1926 年以来增加了约75000 人，但
约70%的人来自五个组织严密的建筑工会。 
 
1.答案：D。主旨题。 
文章提出了T 所代表的scientific management（反对缩短工作时间），以及F 所代表的
“缩短工作时间”两种观点。随后However，作者指出，F 的观点并未得以广泛应用。
最后的例子，证明了作者的判断：缩短工作时间的前景不容乐观。D 选项是最佳答案。 
A 错，该文主旨并不是为了说明The relative merits of two points of view. 
BC 错，并非文章主旨。 
E 错，无中生有。 
 
2.答案：C。推断题。 
根据关键词定位回原文，his particular interest in mass marketing a product- automobiles。
说明automobiles 是F 的particular interest。C 是正确答案。 
ADE 错，比较级的无中生有。 
B 错，encouraged his employees to use the products 无中生有。 
 
3.答案：D。推断题。 
定位到原文最后一句话，even though this represented an raise of about 75,000 since 
1926, about 70 percent of the entire came from five enormously well-organized building 
trades’ unions. 对应D 选项中It overestimates the bargaining prowess。 
A 错，the number of AFL workers...并没有错误。 
B 错，the number of unions obtaining...没有错误。 
C 错，exaggerates 错误。 
E 错，overestimation of the number 错误。 
 
4.答案：B。 
根据reformers 定位到原文：Those reformers who wanted to accept both scientific 
management and reduced hours had to make a greatly negative case, depicting the latter 
as an antidote to the rigors of the former. B 选项中的mitigate 就是antidote 的同义改
写。这些改革者认为，减少工作时间可以减少scientific management 带来的rigors。 
A 错，改革者是两个都接受的。 
C 错，an inherent tension 无中生有。 
DE 错，比较级的无中生有。 
 


 
 
Passage292 
 
解析：与她的导师沃克·埃文斯（Walker Evans）创作的静态、古典的肖像画不同，二十
世纪纽约摄影师海伦·莱维特（Helen Levitt）的照片显得坦率而自然。然而，E 的拍摄对
象直视镜头，因此摄影师和拍摄对象在拍摄肖像时产生共同作用，而L 的拍摄对象似乎
是在不知不觉中被捕捉到的。作为一名“街头”摄影师，在这个词出现之前，L 曾声称
试图捕捉她所发现的生命。但她的技术有一个悖论。她的即兴美学似乎保证了客观性，
因为她是在记录她偶然遇到的街景，但她的照片可以说是高度主观的，是L 自己独特的
专注和观察方式的反映。与E 的作品不同，L 的作品完全是摄影师的作品，没有被拍摄
对象的有意识参与。例如，L 在选择题材时表现出的重复性，她拍摄的许多儿童戴着面
具和伪装的照片，更多地揭示了L 自己，而不是那些题材。 
 
1.答案：C。 
根据the objectivity of Levitt’s photographs 定位到文中“Her off-the-cuff aesthetic 
seemingly guarantees objectivity, since she was recording street scenes she happened 
upon”与C 中“did not arrange”是同义改写。 
A 错，rather than in a studio 无中生有。 
B 错，not personally acquainted 无中生有。 
D 错，avoided using classical principles of composition.无中生有。 
E 错，逻辑错误，与原文相反。 
 
2.答案：B。 
全文前部分都是在讨论“Evans’ portrait photographs”，根据选项回原文定位。 
A 错，rejection of ...street photography 错误，无中生有。  
B 正确，定位句“photographer and subject conspire in the making of a portrait” 
C 错，无中生有。 
D 错，逻辑错误。objectivity 是L 的特征。 
E 错，reveal little 无中生有。 
 
3.答案：E。推断题。 
E 是文中“As a “street” photographer, before the term’s invention, Levitt has 
claimed...”的同义改写。也就是说，在street photographer 这个名称出现之前，L 已经
是先驱了。 
A 错，无中生有。 
B 错，narrow and repetitious range 无中生有。 
C 错，involves scenes contrived 逻辑错误。 
D 错，were not accorded much recognition 无中生有。 
 


 
 
Passage293 
 
解析：经过几十年的竞选活动，美国妇女在1920 年赢得了选举。然而，对妇女地位的
影响比妇女权利活动家所预期的要有限。在投票对许多美国人来说不再是一项重要的政
治活动的历史时刻，妇女获得了选举权。十九世纪中叶，当妇女第一次寻求选举权时，
选民的投票率空前地高，全国许多地方的选举竞争激烈，政党也很重要。但当1920 年
女性最终获得选票时，选举政治基本上是非竞争性的，许多地区实际上都是一党执政，
选民投票率已下滑至历史最低水平。尽管如此，对于女性寻求投票权和保守派试图限制
投票权的获得来说，投票权仍然很重要。 
 
1.答案：B。目的题。 
文中提到voter turnout 的句子在“In the mid-nineteenth century， when women first 
sought suffrage rights，voter turnout rates were unprecedentedly high，...But when 
women finally received the vote in 1920，...voter turnout had slipped to its all-time low”，
对应选项B “explain a significant change”。 
A 错， 无中生有， 文章讨论的不是women suffrage 对美国选举政治的影响。 
C 错，“解释政党重要性的变化”无中生有。 
D 错， voter turnout 不是elections were less competitive 的原因， 
而是一个现象。 
E 错，逻辑错误。 
 
2.答案：C。 
高亮句，通过转折，说明women suffrage 仍然是很重要的。对应C 选项。 
A 错，account for long lag 无中生有。 
BDE 错，比较级的无中生有。 
 
Passage294 
 
解析：一些研究表明，在酸性土壤地区，rbs 非常稀少，而且，在这种情况下，rbs 的体
型比一般的要小。解释包括，年幼的rbs 可能受到酸性土壤的不利影响，以及，成年rbs
能够感知并避免酸性土壤条件，或者，由于酸性土壤而失去rbs 猎物种群可能导致rbs
种群减少。然而研究人员发现克莱尔湖流域土壤呈酸性，但是却有大量高密度的大型rbs。
一个假设是，rbs 可能因为酸性耐受性（即局部适应酸性环境）而产生种内地理变异。
先前的研究表明，一些rbs 对酸性有潜在的局部适应能力。 
 
1.答案：E。推断题。 
第一句讨论的是酸性土壤的rbs的生长情况，E正确，对应“Lake Claire Watershed, where 
soil conditions are acidic...”。 


 
 
A 错，faulty methodology 无中生有。 
B 错，无中生有。 
C 错，found evidence that acidic conditions adversely affect the prey 无中生有。 
D 错，unsubstantiated conclusions 逻辑错误。作者并未下定论。 
 
2.答案：D。主旨题。 
文章的结构是，一开始提出一种发现，然后提供解释。转折后提出新的发现，随后提供
对于新发现的解释。D 最符合。 
A 错，文章不只是cite evidence。 
B 错，文章提出两种findings。而不是针对一种finding 的两种解释。 
C 错，无中生有。 
E 错，more persuasive 无中生有。 
 
Passage295 
 
解析：热带森林通常比同等大小的温带森林有更多的动植物物种。冰河时期，温带地区
的森林遭到破坏，而热带地区则没有。因此，一个关于物种数量不同的解释是，热带森
林通常比温带森林有更长的时间，在那里不同的物种可以生长。 
 
答案：D。逻辑单题。 
原文的逻辑链条是：热带森林的period 更长，因此有利于different species。支持这一
推理可以通过“去他因”。D 选项“自冰河时代以来出现的热带森林的动植物物种数量
并不比同等规模的温带森林多。”可以起到这个作用。 
ABCE 均为无关选项。 
 
Passage296 
 
解析：美国联邦法院，特别是在著名的1962 年B v. C 案之前，常常被认为在选举法、
投票权和其他明显涉及政治的法律问题方面无能为力。当然，这种看法并不完全正确，
因为1962 年前最高法院的判决，例如S v. A 的判决，在该判决之后，南部非洲裔美国
人的投票参与大幅度增加。然而，最高法院并不总是像在S v. A 中那样明确地支持政治
权利。事实上，南北战争和1962 年之间的转变使人们在回顾过去几十年的选民权利案
件时，感觉自己像是一位考古学家，从不同的层面切入，在这些层面上，可以披露的司
法判决揭示了一种意识形态和社会变革的模式。 
 
1.答案：C。目的题。 
根据archaeology 定位到最后一句，“one feels like an archaeologist cutting through 
distinct layers in which the judicial decisions uncovered reveal a pattern of ideological 


 
 
and societal change. ”  
这句话是一个类比，C 选项中characterize the nature of change in judicial thinking 是这
句话的同义改写。 
A 错，contrast 无中生有。 
B 错，perplexed 无中生有。 
D 错，has been lost 无中生有。 
E 错，lack of concern 无中生有。 
 
2.答案：B。推断题。 
 
根据Baker v. Carr 定位到文中第一句。“before the famous 1962 case of Baker v. Carr, 
were often thought to be powerless in the area of...politics.” 也就是说，BC 这个案例之
前，法院判决在政治上都是powerless 的。B 选项“它的决议证明了联邦法院有权处理
与政治有关的法律问题。”正确。 
A 错，Its outcome required clarification 无中生有。 
C 错，marked a radical change 过度推理，无中生有。 
D 错，逻辑错误，时间弄反了。 
E 错，little historical significance 无中生有。 
 
Passage297 
 
解析：在《象牙上的画笔》一书中，J 对小说家简·奥斯汀的评价是这样的：在奥斯汀的
学术领域，存在着使普通的文学评论崩溃的压力。在这些压力中，最主要的是很多读者
对简·奥斯汀持有的独特情感。这种感情不完全是因为对天才的钦佩，也不完全是对她井
然有序、高雅、甚至神秘生活的怀念。作家引导评论家们以传记或历史的方式来看待她
的作品，这些常常是对其他文学评论方式的蔑视，尤其是对现代文学批评中占主导地位
的各种形式方法的蔑视。 
 
1.答案：B。多选题。 
根据关键词定位到原文：“Writer has led critics to approach her work in mostly 
biographical or historical ways,...modern literary criticism.” 
A 错，particularly well suited to biographical and historical readings. 无中生有。 
B 正确，文中说了无视“in defiance of”其他文学评论方式， 
是unsatisfied 同义改写。 
C 错，baffling writer personally 无中生有。 
 
2.答案：C。词汇题。 
在文章语境中，appreciation 是“评价”之意，与C 符合。 


 
 
 
Passage298 
 
解析：传统的消防车颜色是红色，但在那些将黄色卡车引入车队的城市，这些卡车每英
里的交通事故率远远低于红色卡车。一些批评这一创新的人士质疑，这种差异是否应该
归因于颜色，因为黄色卡车通常比红色卡车要新，而红色卡车与之相比。但这种批评可
以被驳回。当然，仅仅是事故率的差异并不是决定性的证据。决定性的事实是，这一比
率只有在黎明和黄昏前后的几个小时内才有显著差异。在这些时候，黄色的能见度是比
红色的更好。 
 
答案：E。高亮句作用题。 
第一个句子，“this difference should be attributed to color,”是作者在文中试图defend
的观点，最后一句再次说了，在黎明和黄昏几个小时内，黄色的能见度的确更好。第二
个句子，“the mere difference in accident rates is not decisive evidence.”是作者做出
的一个让步。因此E 是最佳选项。 
 
Passage299 
 
解析：生物人类学的发现表明，美洲原住民的祖先可能是从东北亚来到美洲的。例如，
T 研究了史前美洲土著和东北亚土著的牙列。根据大约二十个牙齿特征，包括牙冠形状
和根数，他定义了一个叫做Sinodonty 的整体牙型，它包括三个根部的下颌第一磨牙和
铲形门牙。这种独特的模式在大多数美洲原住民和东北亚人中都有，但在南亚、非洲或
欧洲的人中没有发现。另一种不那么复杂的模式Sundadonty 在东南亚人民中也有，在
史前美国人口中也有发现，但特纳认为，广泛分布的Sinodonty 显示了大多数美洲原住
民的东北亚血统。 
 
1.答案：BC。多选题。 
根据题干定位到Sinodonty，“he has defined an overall dental pattern called  
Sinodonty, which includes three-rooted lower first molars and shovel-shaped incisors.(此
处对应B )This distinctive pattern is shared among most Native Americans and people 
from northeastern Asia, but is not found in people who originated in southern Asia, Africa, 
or Europe. ”得出答案C。 
A 选项错，因为Sundadonty 并不是Turner 的发现。 
 
2.答案：BC。多选题。 
根据题干定位，B 选项对应“Another less complex pattern—Sundadonty”，C 选项对
应“Turner believes that widespread Sinodonty demonstrates most Native Americans’ 
northeastern Asian origins. ” 选项中”occurs frequently”是widespread 的同义改写。 


 
 
A 选项错，这个是二者的共同点。 
 
Passage300 
 
解析：B 政府为所有公民提供医疗保健。五年前，由于与吸烟有关的健康问题导致的费
用占政府每年开支的5%，B 的卫生机构发起了一项全国性的禁烟运动。虽然该运动成功
地大幅度减少了B 的吸烟者人数，但显然未能减少因吸烟引起的健康问题而产生的年度
费用，因为这些费用目前占政府年度支出的6%。 
 
答案：D。逻辑单题。 
Assumption 将选项取非，如果可以削弱原文结论，就是正确选项。 
D 选项取非，B 政府的年度支出现在明显低于五年前的水平，这就削弱了结论。因为总
值少了，即使占6%，也比之前的5%要少。 


passage 301
2. 答案：E
解析：高亮量句本身有extent 强调程度，后文具体说最早和最初的两个作品，也是
为了体现思想贯穿他作品始终。
passage 302
1. 答案：E
解析：高亮句是指出特殊情况，对前文信息进行修正。即便有丰富的种子，但是在没
有工具的情况下猩猩产生的学习行为比起S 猩猩要少。因此选E，S 猩猩对于工具的
使用不能仅仅只依赖于栖息地特定食物的获得性，即：也要考虑有没有工具可使用的
情况。
2. 答案：C
解析：可多选题，根据题干关键词orangutans live mostly in dry forests 定位到
While previously studied orangutans mostly inhabited dry forests, the Suaq
orangutans inhabit a lush swamp where insects flourish in tree holes and Neesia
fruit is abundant.表明不同环境中的猩猩都有学习使用工具的能力。因此选C。
他们可能使用一些工具，虽然这些工具的使用没有被研究者观察到。while 句表明，
之前的研究中心，也发现了dry forests 的猩猩能够学习使用工具，选项与文章矛盾。
对于食物的厌恶，无中生有。
passage 303


C 选项正确，生活在那个时期的雅典人很少骑马，从而排除了这些骑马的人是普通雅
典人，加强了他们是骑兵的可能性。
A 选项错，原文研究的是cavalry soldiers，而不是foot soldiers，类比错误。
B 选项错，女性在当时能不能参军，与本文的论证无关。
D 选项错，墓地里有没有发现马的骨头，与这些遗骨是不是骑兵的论证也无关。
E 选项错，能不能确定墓葬的具体位置与文章论证无关。
passage 304
1. 答案：E
解析：题目问作者对于“current scholarship”会同意如下哪个说法，因此须定位
作者观点或评价等信息所在句子。二段第一句陈述current scholarship 具体内容。
第三句but 转折，作者开始进行评价。But Voss's account fails to explain why the
Knights succumbed so easily when other union movements thrived. 但是V 的说
法并没有解释为什么其他联盟的运动兴盛繁荣而骑士会缺如此轻易地屈服了。也就是
对于V 提出的解释进行了质疑，认为其没有解释骑士会衰败的原因。因此答案选E。
3. 答案：E


解析：高亮的organizations 是骑士会的竞争对手，他们吸引了部分流失的员工，增
加了力量导致了骑士会迅速衰败。第一段最后一句说到，The Knights' defeat
demoralized those who championed radical reform and the organization of
workers as a class, while empowering those who promoted a less inclusive
strategy.骑士会的失败打击了那些倡导彻底改革和将工人组织为一个阶级的人的士
气，同时增强了不包容性不那么强的人的力量。因此，骑士会的对手也就是
organizations 包容性较差，E 同义替换。
passage 305
1. 答案：C
解析：根据题干，定位第三句，由第三句a slow-acting venom that facilitate prey
capture 直接对应C 选项a weapon…to incapacitate their prey。
A 选项错，digest their food 无中生有；
B 选项错，maintaining…immune systems 无中生有；
D 选项错，transmitted directly … to their offspring 无中生有；
E 选项错，无中生有。
2. 答案：第四句
解析：本题选择第四句，其中a gap 对应原文第四句offered no mechanism，an
explanation 对应原文Auffenberg 的观点。
passage 306
1. 答案：C
解析：句子作用题，考查句内关系。
C 选项正确。首先，高亮句告诉我们，强烈的情感与科学程序本质上是不相容的，对
应a principle；同时高亮句也在支持前一句的观点，前一句提到为什么超自然的现
象在科学实验条件下观察不到。A 选项错，高亮句并不是作者的main conclusion。
B 选项错，recommended course of action 无中生有。
D 选项错，undermine 方向不对。
E 选项错，emphasize a limitation 找不到对应。


passage 307
1. 答案：C
解析：A 选项是错误归因，文章并没有提到这两者之间的任何关联；文章提到过alive
这个词，但是说的是芭蕾舞必须alive，才能让别人知道为什么它重要，所以B 选项
和原文描述不吻合。C 选项正确，对应文章中这句话：But dance has no written
tradition and disappears easily from collective memory。
2. 答案：A
解析：这个题对应文章这句话：producing an impressive body of great ballets and
laying a foundation for generations to come. 在他死之前，文章是这么评价她
的，然后死之后有对比，所以死之后要体现被人遗忘这个事情，所以只有A 选项提到
了这点。
passage 308
1. 答案：A
解析：主旨目的题。首句给出事实，2018 年，美国国会通过了45Q 立法。后文引出讨
论，对此举措存在争议。but 前后，some environmental critics have attacked..
以及some environmentalists argue that...表明不同学者对此举有着反对及支持的
不同态度。因此选A，对于此立法有争议的反面进行了讨论。


2. 答案：E
解析：事实信息题。题目问的是“一些环境批评家”反对45Q 立法的原因。原文高亮
句中as 提示抨击45Q 立法的原因，他们认为45Q 只是一个变相的化石燃料补贴项目，
也就认为这一策略并没有从根本上解决气候问题。因此选E，misleading 性质判断正
确。
passage 309
1. 答案：C
解析：对应文章这句话：When newer, larger plants required more real estate,
they were built farther from customers，required more real estate 意味着这
么做要花更多的钱，所以对应C 选项。
2. 答案：D
解析：文章中可以看出现代的发电站都因为各种原因离人群很远，所以把steam 用来
加热的需求在电站附近就很少了，所以对应答案是D 选项。
passage 310
答案：A
解析：这个题是削弱题，假设说的是因为电站附近温度高，食物多，所以M 折中
动物会过来。所以削弱需要找到一个选项说明M 折中动物不是因为食物过来的，A 选
项符合要求，因为当电站一关，M 就走了，说明就算电站附近有食物，M 也不留下，
所以M 在电站附近的原因是其他因素。D 选项属于加强。


passage 311
1. 答案：C
解析：文章第一段介绍了一个关于相对温暖期的理论，第二段讲到有一些证据表明这
个温暖期其实不是那么连续的而且是相对局部的，质疑了第一段的理论的问题。A 选
项，不是对debate 的总结，而是总体在质疑个理论的问题；B 选项，并没有明确发生
观点的转变；D 选项，没有unexpected，也不对应文章结构；E 选项，并不是在否认
之前证据的相关性。
3. 答案：B
解析：组织结构题，文章第一段介绍了一个关于相对温暖期的理论，第二段讲到有一
些证据表明这个温暖期其实不是那么连续的而且是相对局部的，质疑了第一段的理论
的问题。最后也提到了有些证据说明有长期的cooling trend。
4. 答案：C
解析：A 逻辑错误，不是the early modern period 之后才开始；B 无关，文章讨论
的是这个period 本身的特征，并没有否定它作为原因。
passage 312


passage 313
1. 答案：E
解析：高亮句对应的前文是Tea CessCommittee (TCC) made only sporadic,
small-scale attempts to create demand for tea 【in India】，说明小袋茶是为
了印度本土市场的宣传活动；高亮句后文的第二句尤其是通过still，可以看出来这
些宣传效果很差。因此选E，小袋茶在扩充本地市场方面不是很有效。A 的小袋茶与
其他形式茶叶的比较关系、B 的too
valuable 均是无中生有。C 的local surplus
并不是定位区间中有小袋茶有关的信息，属于答非所问。D 是针对出口市场，而原文
不管是高亮信息自己的前后文，还是全文主旨，都是针对印度本土市场，D 是无中生
有选项。
2. 答案：E
解析：这题考察的为什么TCC 要改名为ITMEB，这个信息是最后一句。这题考察的是
改名字的目的，最后一句与前文的句间关系，是顺承关系。前文描述的是大萧条Great
Depression 改变了茶叶市场，国际茶价剧增；最后一句TCC 改名为ITMEB 是为了顺应
新的市场即印度本土市场。E 选项说改名字是为了回应大萧条带来的经济条件，符合
前后文的句间关系。A 的national identity，B 的low-quality tea，C 的exotic
origins 都属于无中生有选项。D 选项的larger budget 虽然在定位区间中出现，但
是原文中改名字和budget 是and 衔接的并列关系，并不存在改名字是为了获得更大
的budget 这个目的，D 属于答非所问选项：无法回答题干要求的in order to 改名字
的目的。
passage 314
2. 答案：A
解析：这题考察高亮句与前后文的句间关系，需看出高亮句与最后一句联系紧密，这
个联系可以通过最后一句的指代词this 看出。高亮句是为了支持最后一句的观点，
高亮句表达非洲文学并不是关于本土文化，也并不能称之为national，这都是为了反
对认为这些文学的国家性（最后一句内容）。A 反映了高亮句与最后一句的这种支持


关系，以及最后一句是全文的结论这个作用。B 错在前文是事实陈述，没有观点
assertion。
passage 315
答案：E
解析：原文大意：
与大多数植物不同，仙人掌主要在夜间吸收空气中的二氧化碳。
夜间空气含有比白天空气更多的某些类型的碳。
因此，这些类型的碳在仙人掌中比在大多数其他植物中更常见。
然而，作为寄生在仙人掌上的Quintral 植物，含有几乎与仙人掌相同比例的这些类
型的碳。
因此，Quintral 植物很可能从它们的仙人掌寄主那里吸收了大量的碳，因为______。
E 选项正确，因为Quintral 植物从空气中吸收的二氧化碳都是在白天吸收的，而它还
含有与仙人掌相同比例的某些只有夜间才由的特有的碳,说明这些碳只能是由仙人掌
那里获得。
A 选项错，无关，没法解释结论；
B、D 选项错，加量，原文细节补充；
C 选项错，only 加量。
passage 316
1. 答案：C
解析：本题问作者对historical demographers 的观点中关于birth rate in
early-modern German cities 的看法，而实际上，全文都可以作为区间，所以本文没
法定位，要么读全文，要么用选项定位验证。
A 选项错，sanitary conditions 在第三句提到，与出生率无关，与死亡率有关。
B 选项错，city populations 与in-migration 有关，与出生率无关。
C 选项正确，正是因为出生率是低于死亡率的才使得their populations could not be
sustained by reproduction。
D 选项错，同A 选项，population density 与出生率无关。
E 选项错，原文并未对cities 与communities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants
的出生率做对比。


passage 317
答案：A
解析：逻辑单题——归纳题，也就是常规推断题的做法。
原文大意：
大多数研究表明，年轻人比65 岁以上的人更好地完成短期记忆任务。
但这些研究都是在下午进行的。
在最近一项在上午和下午进行的研究中，年龄较大的参与者在上午的表现要比下午的
好得多。
然而，年轻的参与者在早上的表现并没有好到哪里去。
题目问，根据原文，可以推出下面哪个结论。A 选项正确，过去的研究与最新的研究
对比，可知年纪较大的人在短时记忆方面的能力是被之前的研究低估了（因为之前的
研究都是在下午做的）。
对于早上做的研究，people over 65 与younger adults 的表现无法判断。原文只是
65 岁以上的早上和下午做了比较，younger adults 早上和下午做了比较。B 无法推出。
C 选项错，long-term memory 原文没提。
D 选项错，之前的研究恰恰表明年纪对short-term memory 的能力是有影响的。
E 选项错，无法根据文章推出。
passage 318
1. 答案：C
解析：由首句可知early scholars 认为Appalachian’s dance 是源自于ancient
English country dance；但随后第二句指出Appalachian’s music 虽然包括了British
的传统，但同时也有native to America 的特征，同时第三句再次强调Appalachian’
s music 范围从British ballads 到African American blues，可以对应C 选项正确。
其余选项均在原文找不到对应依据。


passage 319
2. 答案：C
解析：本题不太好定位，第一反应都会第二段找，但其实第二段并没有告知工人罢工
的原因到底是什么。所以本题应该意识到没法直接通过题干来定位了，那就选项定位。
C 选项对应第三段最后一句，Local 36 的问题都符合了NWLB 的关注，其中就提到了
the recognition of workers' right to a wage on which they could live，C 选
项正确。A 错，highly unsafe 无中生有；B 错，Vacation or sick leave 无中生有；
D 错，more men than women 没提，同理E 中often fired for…也找不到对应。
3. 答案：E
解析：定位第二段第四句，根据never held the power of enforcement 同义替换，
对应E 选项。
A 错，successfully changed 逻辑错误，原文说了it regretfully informed the
workers that they were on their own，所以，干什么都得靠自己啊。
B 错，它根本就没有执行得权力。
C、D 均找不到对应。
4. 答案：D
解析：定位最后一段，“Whereas after the war many United States labor


organizations lost the feeling of community generated during the period of
national crisis, Local 36
remained a singularly effective experiment in
interracial cooperation.”，这个就是D 选项所描述的，internal cohesion 对应
feeling of community，而且最主要的是这个选项的lost 和generated during the
war 这两个元素对应题目里的erosion 和previously realized。这题不能选C，因为
C 说的是Local 36 的情况。
passage 320
翻译：计算水电站的环境影响并不简单。大坝建设需要钢铁和水泥，而这些材料的制
造需要温室气体的排放。对这些排放量的估计相对简单明了，并且它们与产生无温室
气体的水力发电的效益相比，后果很小。但更难估计的温室气体的产生发生在电厂运
行期间。大坝后面大片区域的淹没导致植被的微生物分解，从而产生大量的甲烷——
一种强大的温室气体。此外，根除植被可以消除植被对温室气体二氧化碳的消耗。估
计这些气体的数量是很困难的，其数量取决于具体位置、地形和水坝及其相关湖泊的
功率强度。
1. 答案：B
解析：文章主要表达的意思是Calculating hydroelectric plants' environmental
impact 不能只看dam building，这个过程很容易实现，而其他很多过程就不好估算
了。所以只有B 选项是对应这个主题的，A 选项感觉意思就是说要看所有的plants
而不是a few plants，这个明显不对。


passage 321
文章大意翻译：
①1950 年代的非洲裔美国音乐家在古典音乐方面面临困境。
②国际化的现代古典音
乐知识展示使诸如艾灵顿公爵（Duke Ellington）之类的艺术家能够反驳人们误认为
爵士乐音乐家没有学历的误解。③然而，爵士音乐家对古典音乐的兴趣这件事通常让
人们认为爵士创新源自欧洲。④在Charlie Parker 对Bartok 表示钦佩之后，一名采
访者问帕克的音乐创新是否是对经典前辈思想的改编。
⑤通常，与现代欧洲作曲家的
比较将爵士乐与假定的古典音乐高级标准联系在一起，却没有意识到爵士乐通过发展植
根于多种非裔美国人音乐中的表现性和即兴性原则来表达自己的音乐视野，从而挑战了
在美国音乐中的欧洲标准的霸权。
1. 答案：C
解析：信息目的题。yet 转折之后提出新观点，Bartok 作为具体的一位musician 代
表为例对观点进行支持。因此选
C。  
2. 答案：D
解析：首句指出20 世纪50 年代非遗美国音乐家们在古典音乐方面面临两难的境地。
第二句进一步展开论证，对现代古典音乐知识的世界性展示，使艾灵顿公爵
(Duke 
Ellington)等艺术家能够反驳人们对爵士音乐家未经教育的误解。
yet 之后进行转折，
爵士音乐家们对古典音乐的兴趣通常被认为是承认爵士音乐的创新之处来自欧洲，即并
非是untutored。因此选D，与许多爵士音乐家音乐背景的透彻理解并不相容。

文章大意翻译：
以下段落来自对栖息地与疾病之间关系的研究。
①在一组北部的温带湖泊中，浮游水生水蚤（Daphnia dentifera）寄主种群中常见
的有毒真菌的大流行在陡峭的
U 形湖泊中比在缓坡的V 形湖泊中更为普遍。②根据
一种假设，这是由于宿主易感性的差异所致。
③但是，在对十二个湖泊的研究中，我
们发现在原位微观实验中盆地形状与寄主敏感性之间没有关系，在该实验中，每个湖泊
的寄主都与孢子一起孵育。④因此，宿主在流行病很少发生的
V 形湖泊中对这种有毒
真菌寄生虫的感染并没有显着降低。⑤这一结果与实验室控制更为严格的实验结果相
吻合，而实验室实验则利用较少的
Jakes 进行了遗传相似的生物研究。⑥即使我们
控制了湖泊之间温度的细微变化（因为温度提高了传播）和湖泊之间成虫的平均体型大

流行病的快速进化一致。


2. 答案：A
根据题干定位词，可以定位到原文最后一句，然后同义替换可以直接对应答案
A，本
题不难。
B、C、D、E 选项错，在定位句中未提到对应内容。
3. 答案：E
本题并不能通过题干进行定位，建议通过选项验证。
A 错，全文并未提到genetic diversity，更未提到其与这种真菌爆发的关系；
B 错，与原文矛盾，原文倒数第二句提到了，size also elevates transmission，
所以真菌体积越大，越容易带来爆发；
C 错，与原文最后一句矛盾；
D 错，找不到对应；
E 正确，对应原文倒数第二句，temperature elevates transmission。

①华尔街百万富翁阿尔弗雷德·鲁米斯（Alfred Loomis）是一位业余物理学家，为
科学研究做出了重要贡献。②1928 年，他购买了三个相同的时钟，这是当时最精确的
时钟。③鲁米斯将钟摆成彼此成三角形的方向，以打破重力引起的钟摆之间的同步作

④这些
结果后来为LORAN（远程导航）的发展做出了贡献。⑤LORAN 通过比较来自多个无线
电信标在各个地面位置的信号到达时间的差异，对船舶和飞机的位置进行了三角划分，
该计算依赖于精确的计时 。
1. 答案：D
解析：根据These results later contributed to the development of LORAN 找
到上一句中by analyzing their minute variations, verified a theoretically 
predicted tidal effect of the Moon on clocks，D 选项是这句的同义改写。 
2. 答案：B


解析：根据第三句中verified a theoretically predicted tidal effect of the 
Moon on clocks 可以得到B。

passage 325
文章大意翻译：
①尽管盖尔·琼斯的小说受到了广泛的批评和关注，但她相对安静却强大的诗歌集却
被学者们几乎忽略了。②值得注意的是，琼斯的第一部出版物出现在诗歌中，从
1969 年到1980 年代初期，她的文学作品包括几乎与短篇小说一样多的诗歌，这与诗歌
的形成和始终如一的交往背道而驰。③琼斯缺乏对诗人的批判性认识至少可以部分归
因于她所记录的关于体裁界限和艺术身份的矛盾情绪：
“我从没真正把自己当成诗人。
④我写过我所谓的诗，但我一直想着我本人主要是小说作家，所以我从讲故事的人的角


度和兴趣来写诗。” ⑤与这种自我概念化相一致的是，琼斯关于其他诗人作品的批判
性观察常常集中在传统上与小说写作相关的技术上：叙事及其呈现通常似乎超过韵律和
形式的各种诗学惯例。⑥琼斯在回顾斯特林·布朗的作品时，提供了一份清单，列出
了最吸引她的诗歌内容：人物表征和叙事声音，以及诸如戏剧形式和场景等小说的结构
性关注，所有这些都结合在一起，主要在制定有效的叙事诗学上表现出对情感的兴趣。
1. 答案：E
解析：根据题干定位到最后一句，答案对应这句冒号前面的主干部分，原文
 
attracts≈选项 interest。
2. 答案：A
解析：A 选项的teller of stories 在原文有多处对应，属于原文的主旨信息，最直
接的对应可以根据 self-identification 找到中间引号内部 Jones 的自述，她定义
自我为 storyteller。最后一句也强调了 effective storyteller 是 Jones 觉得
写诗有吸引力的地方。BCE 的比较关系是无中生有， D 的 unprecedented 无中生
有。
3. 答案：C
解析：C 对应中间Jones's lack of critical recognition as a poet is at 
least partially traceable to her documented ambivalence regarding genre 
boundaries and artistic identity 这句：题干所提到的 critics 对 Jones 的作
品的态度是忽略（选项的 nature of their focus 对应原文的 lack of critical 
recognition），而这种态度是受到 Jones 的自我认知的影响，因为 Jones 自己对
不同文体的界限和自我定位很复杂矛盾。A 的 unawareness，B 的definitions of 
those genres accepted by Jones's contemporaries, 和D 的 narrow-minded 无中
生有。E 的 foreground … prosody and form 在原文是 Jones 的观点内容，与 
critics 无关。
passage 326


文章大意翻译：
①最近发现的一些赫梯碑证实了在伊利亚特（Iliad）中出现的许多关于古代生活的
描述，甚至列出了据报道将船只运送到特洛伊的希腊城市。
 ②这一发现意味着，
《伊利亚特》不仅是人们普遍认为的简单的创造性文学，因此也不是仅涉及文学讨论
的问题。 ③相反，它也是历史，应该由历史科学加以审查。
1. 答案：B 
解析：题目的前提是H 印证了Iliad 里的一些内容，而得到结论说
Iliad 不仅仅只
是一种文学的东西，也应该是历史。假设题需要构建前提与结论中的链接，如果用
H 印证了Iliad 就说明后者是历史，那么H 本身也需要是历史才可以。答案
B 说他们
的不是来自于非历史的东西，也就是说
H 和Iliad 都得是来自历史的东西，正确。

多。⑤它们使我们能够发现迄今为止未知的现象，并且常常导致与
“常识”相冲突的
发现。⑥但是冲突是在结论的层面上，而不是基本方法上。
1. 答案：B
解析：B 对应原文最后一句，they（指代 scientific measurements）often lead 
to discoveries that conflict with "common sense."，对应选项的科学会更容易
获得新的发现。A 的 undermine，C 的 undervalued 是无中生有；D E 对应第二句，
是科学和生活的共同点，与题干要求矛盾。
2. 答案：A
解析：答案对应高亮句与前一句的句间关系，前一句表达科学家和普通人的共同点，高
亮句表达科学与日常的不同点、优点。高亮句是要让步反对前文，
A 的 qualify 对
应这种句间关系。让步立场并不是要完全推翻前文，

1. 答案：B
根据第4 句no authoritative master text dates from Ripley's lifetime in

物和商品的中心。②但是，在这些定居点发掘的东西几乎没有留下任何在瓦努
科·潘帕（HuánucoPampa）仓库中用于存放货物的陶器的痕迹。③没有陶器痕迹是不
确定的，因为货物可能已经分配到了属于仓库的那些容器以外的其他容器中。
第2 段：
①一份十六世纪的西班牙文件可能会无意间揭示了答案：虽然详细说明了从周边地区带
入仓库的无数货物实例，但该文件并未说明从仓库向整个周边地区分发货物的情况。
②
因此，有关城市作为配送中心角色的最初建议可能是错误的：
HuánucoPampa 之所以
要保留这些巨大的仓库，可能只是为了确保自己在艰难时期的福祉。
2. 答案：D
解析：文章在however 之后进行了对原来考古结果解释的驳斥，但在措辞中都体现出
了较温和的态度。一段中inconclusive 不确定的，二段中inadvertently 无意地、
may be incorrect、may have been...等都表明了推测之意且并非直接完全否定。文
章最后一句给出结论通过对于文献的分析，可能表明此处可能是从周边地区收集物品为
了囤积物品以解决自身在困难时期的物品需求，因此选
D。
3. 答案：A


解析：削弱题。文中作者对于
Pampa 仓库的功能分析认为此处可能是用来囤积周边区
域运送来物品的仓库以保证自身在困难时期的不时之需而非分发地。与此同时文中语言
表明了这种可能性的分析其实相对较弱。A 选项中solely 一词将文献中所揭示的内
容进行了绝对化限制，只存在一种可能性，即此处是周边区域农夫和工匠们每年向
Pampa 仓库提供粮食和商品的地区。
passage 331
文章大意翻译：
①模拟表明，并且观察证实，构成土星环的粒子正在向行星的卫星释放角动量。
 ②
这些模拟预测，在仅仅几亿年的时间里，相关的能量转移将导致环的坍塌。
 ③计算
机模型显示，类似的过程围绕着从中生出行星的物质盘中的年轻恒星发生，并且这些原
行星盘确实迅速消失了。 ④但是，如果土星环的寿命如此之短，那么过去几亿年来，
土星附近的一颗大彗星或月亮（环的推测来源）必定已经破裂了。
 ⑤那是不太可能
的。在40 亿年前或更久的年轻太阳系中，这种可能性更大。
1. 答案：A
解析：对应到原文“An analogous process occurs around young stars in the 
disks of matter from which planets emerge, and these protoplanetary disks 
do vanish that quickly, computer models show.”，说明提到protoplanetary 
disks 是说明以前computer model 使用过，现在又继续使用到Saturn’s rings 了。
 
2. 答案：BC
解析：B 选项正确，首先energy transfer 前面有一个单词related，说明和前文的
particles 是有关联的，然后energy 
transfer 能导致collapse，说明也会发出
angular momentum。C 选项正确，对应文章这句话“Yet if Saturn’s rings are 
so short-lived, a large comet or moon--the rings’ presumed source--must 
have broken apart in Saturn’s vicinity within the past several hundred 
million years.”，尤其是must have broken apart 这个肯定的语气，说明在
young stars 附近这个过程发生的更剧烈。 
passage 332
文章大意翻译：
第1 段：
①在过去两个世纪中，功能强度和美学吸引力看似无关的目标不仅已成功集成到许多经
典的悬索桥中，而且通常由工程师独自或领导团队实现。
②实际上，托马斯·特尔
福德（Thomas 
Telford）既是他的梅奈悬索桥的工程师和建筑师，约翰
·罗布林


（John Roebling）也是他的布鲁克林大桥的工程师和建筑师。
③这些工程结构特别
被视为建筑标志，证明了工程师可以达到的美学高度。
第2 段：
①工程师在艺术上没有泰尔福德和罗布林（Telford and Roebling）更具信心，他们
聘请咨询建筑师为他们提供设计建议，从放置在大型锚地和摩天大楼高塔上的外墙，到
甲板栏杆和路灯柱的装饰细节。②乔治·华盛顿和其他许多纽约市桥梁的总工程师奥
特玛·安曼（Othmar Ammann）经常寻求著名建筑师的帮助。③当乔治华盛顿只是个
纸上想法时，安曼聘请了伍尔沃斯大厦（Woolworth Building）和其他地标的建筑师
卡斯·吉尔伯特（Cass Gilbert）来描绘塔如何用石头完成。④由于桥梁建成时资金
紧张，因此，钢结构的塔架被裸露了-瑞士建筑师勒·柯布西耶（Le Corbusier）发
现了极富吸引力的外观，而裸钢成为了巨大的桥梁塔架的新美学标准。
1. 答案：E
解析：文章的结构是第一段先声明本看起来无关的两个
aims 实际是相互整合的，而
后第二段举了工程师依赖建筑师的指导，并在文章末尾提到建筑师也受到了工程的启发。
因此答案选E。
2. 答案：AC
解析：B 选项 不对，题目没有提到雇佣的资金问题。A 选项来自最后一句提到内容，
and bare steel became the new aesthetic standard for monumental bridge 
towers，符合touchstone 的说法。C 选项来自文章中Engineers 
less 
artistically confident than Telford and Roebling have engaged consulting 
architects to advise them on the design of everything from the facades 
placed on massive anchorages and skyscraper 这句，Othmar Ammann 是随后举的
例子。
3. 答案：A
解析：定位到文章第二段中这句
Since money was tight when the bridge was 
being completed, however, the steel-framed towers were left bare，选择A。

①奥克维尔（Oakville）的大多数居民都希望建造一个社区游泳池，但不希望用地方
税收来筹集资金。 ②奥克维尔市市长辩称，尽管该镇没有财政储备，但建设游泳池不
会导致更高的税收，因为可以使用未使用的城镇拥有的土地，入场费将支付游泳池运营
和S3 的全部费用。 ③万美元的建设债务。
1. 答案：C
解析：削弱题。前提：大多数
O 的居民想要修建公共游泳池且不花费当地税收。结论：
O 市长认为，尽管该市没有财政储备，但修建游泳池不会导致更高的税收，因为有一块
未使用的城镇所有土地可以使用，入场费将覆盖游泳池的全部运营成本，以及
300


万美元的建设债务的偿还。推翻结论需表明入场费用不可涵盖目前所需全部费用或另有
其他费用尚未考虑其中。因此选
C，游泳池的运营将增加通往拟建游泳池地点的道路
的交通，并将要求城镇提供昂贵的道路改善资金。即，另有他因尚未纳入考虑，因此市
长的观点被削弱。 
passage 334
文章大意翻译：
①伊索贝尔·格伦迪（Isobel Grundy）正确地指出，在研究19 世纪前女性的历史著
作时，学者们必须对历史进行广泛的界定，并包括历史小说，传记，宫廷回忆录和家族
史。②格伦迪还认为，这些著作提供了“整个女性文化的历史，同时体现了
19 世纪
以前的女性化”与历史的关系。③在这一点上，我持怀疑态度，因为我不认为女性与
历史之间存在特殊的关系。④相反，我的研究表明，十九世纪以前的英国女作家从事
历史话语的活动取决于他们的政治承诺和阶级归属以及对发展历史体裁和市场的看法。
⑤在广泛概括女性作家与历史的交往之前，我们必须充分注意无数的个人作家和著作。
1. 答案：C
解析：根据题干定位到第一句后半句，答案对应这句前半句：在研究
 
women’s 
historical writing 时，需要对 history 进行广义的定义并包括题干说的文体。A
选项 的 origins，B 选项的时间的比较，D 选项的文体的比较无中生有。E 的 
homogeneous 与后文作者观点矛盾。
2. 答案：C
解析：Grundy 与作者的区别是文章二三两句的对比：G 认为第一句说的作品可以提
供 whole female culture 全部女性文化的的历史；但作者不认为有一种有代表性的
 
characteristic 
的女性与历史的关系。两者的分歧在于是否有
 
whole、characteristic 的区别，G 认为女性有共性，作者认为每个作家都不同。即
 
C 说的 heterogeneity 与 unified 的对比。A 的 markets 和 D 的 social 
classes 只有作者分析了 G 没提。B 的多个genre 和一个 genre 的对比无中生有，
原文作者和 G 分析的都是第一句说的文体。E 的时间关系无中生有。

passage 336
文章大意翻译：
第1 段：
①到19 世纪中叶，手工艺品的性别和阶级协会有所改变。
②在18 世纪，诸如刺绣，
毛毛雨（从织锦上解开和倒回金属线）和拼贴等手工艺品因其贵族关系而备受推崇，男
女都在实践。③但是在19 世纪初期，手工艺被专门编码为女性的爱好，并且越来越被
中产阶级的敏感性，节俭，熟练的家庭管理模式所认可。
④这并不意味着手工艺品仅
限于中产阶级，相反，针线活在上层阶级妇女中仍然很流行，而家庭装饰甚至被非常贫
穷的人所珍视。⑤但这意味着，手工艺品现在象征着资产阶级的道德，管理美德，而
不仅仅是贵族的闲暇，而其他阶级的成员在做手工艺品时也效仿了这些中产阶级的理想。
⑥在19 世纪，当高级场所在很大程度上不对女性开放时，他们利用最容易获得的元素
将其创意冲动传递到了周围的世界。⑦这种家庭装饰也得到了认可，因为它增加了家
庭的舒适感，而更雄心勃勃的高级艺术被谴责为自私自利地利用时间带走家庭。
第2 段：
①的确，到19 世纪中叶，手工艺品最明显，最紧急的功能是象征女性。
②手工艺品
是由家中的女性居民制作的，因此似乎是她身体的延伸，并带有她的品味和技巧的迹象。
③女人的手握住了它，她的思想已经计划好了，她的眼睛已经确定了它，并且她向完成
的对象传达了某种无形的主观性。④因此，对于维多利亚女王时代，女性迷上了自己
制造的商品茧，这代表了她们身份中其他看不见的方面。
⑤这就是Ruskin 著名的主
张的形象，即“无论真正的妻子到哪里，这个家总是在她身边。
” ⑥这种飞行器经
常被描述为“漂亮”或“优雅”的品质，使制造商自己的物体掩盖了该物体。
⑦手工


艺品是将妇女的家庭技能具体化而成的，这是她家务劳动的有形痕迹，这对于在闲暇时
间从事生产更为有价值，因为这表明劳务是闲暇的，而且她从未停止工作以改善家园。
1. 答案：E
解析：由于全文大篇幅都在介绍
19 世纪的手工制作，所以本题由题干是没法定位的，
那就从选项一一验证。ABCD 在原文中均找不到对应依据，E 选项对应第一段第5 句，
手工制作不仅是贵族的休闲，也是其它阶级争相效仿的。
2. 答案：A
解析：先由Ruskin 定位到原文，由This is the image behind Ruskin…可知，提
到这个人就是为前文服务，对应
A 选项。
3. 答案：C
解析：文章手段告诉我们手工艺主要由女性制作的意义，二者也是继续展开描述。
C
选项对应，a realm of activity 即是对应handicraft；
A 错，文章并非在单纯cite factors；
B 错，原文没有提到misconception；
D 错，reconsider certain assumptions 无中生有；
E 错，并未在质疑一个解释。
4. 答案：B
解析：同题一，本题没法通过题干定位，只能用选项进行验证。
A 错，比较关系无中生有； 
B 正确，一开始是由其他阶级的女性来效仿，后面对女性的重要性确实是在增加，也正
好对应本文讨论的主体内容。
C、D、E 错，在原文均找不到对应。
passage 337
文章大意翻译：
第1 段：
①动机推理理论表明，在法律判决中，不同的法官将根据其背景和基本价值观对同一信
息进行不同的评估。②态度主义者（主张法官的决定是由他们自己的政策偏好所驱动
的理论家）已经同意，他们对意识形态决策的发现可以通过
“人为反省”来解释，以
“说服自己愿意相信的东西的适当性是出于动机推理。
”
第2 段：
①但是，动机性推理会受到“合理性约束”的约束。②例如，当决策的风险更高，必
须证明决策合理以及将决策公开时，决策的准确性就会提高。
③这种情况通常适用于
司法裁决。④与偏好相反的更强论据的存在降低了动机的影响。
⑤从美国最高法院的
众多一致意见（其成员通常代表一系列意识形态倾向）和其他法官似乎投票反对其意识


形态偏爱的案件中，可以看出动机推理能力的局限性。
⑥人们可以预料，当法律的确
定性相对较低时，这种动机性推理的影响力便会达到顶峰，这与实证研究的结果是一致
的。
1. 答案：D
解析：D 对应第二段中间的The presence of stronger arguments contrary to 
preferences reduces the influence of motivations.这句：在有很强的论证的时
候，会削弱motivation 的影响：选项 mitigate 对应原文的 reduce，compelling 
arguments 对应 stronger arguments，challenge the biases 对应 contrary to 
preference. A 与第一句矛盾，C 与最后一句矛盾。BE 的比较无中生有。 
2. 答案：D
解析：文章举 Supreme Court 的例子是为了证明motivated reasoning 会受到合理
性的局限，需要很强的论证和面向大众的判决都会使得
 motivated reasoning 受限。
高亮句提到最高法院的成员来自不同的背景但常能达成共识（
unanimous 
decision），和很多法官投了与自己意识形态相反的票，都是为了证明这是
 
motivated 
reasoning 
受限的体现。在 
motivated 
reasoning 
受限时，有
unanimous decision =》如果motivated reasoning 不受限，可能无unanimous 
decision。
3. 答案：C
解析：对应第二段主旨：motivated reasoning 会受到合理性的限制，C 的 policy 
preferences 是 motivated reasoning 的体现（第一段最后一句）。ABE 矛盾，D
的insufficiently distinguished 无中生有。

雀通常也会失去一些卵。 ④然而，在海鸥巢附近筑巢的麻雀比在海鸥巢附近筑巢的麻
雀向流食者损失的卵子趋于减少，因为__________。
答案：A
解析：填空题。前提：乌鸦、海鸥以及麻雀都生存在
F 岛上。乌鸦以麻雀蛋为食因此
对麻雀数量构成威胁。尽管海鸥并不像乌鸦那样善于找到麻雀的巢穴，但是麻雀通常也
会因为海鸥的捕食而失去一些蛋。结论：然而，麻雀如果把巢筑在离海鸥近的地方比起
远离海鸥的巢穴，损失的蛋要少。since 表明需填空补充条件。前提中导致麻雀蛋减
少的因素有2：乌鸦和海鸥，且乌鸦捕食的蛋数量更多。所以要保证靠近海鸥的地方损

①关于小说家威拉·凯瑟（Willa Cather，1873-1947）的许多学术讨论都争论着凯
瑟是属于19 世纪现实主义传统还是属于20 世纪初的现代主义革命。②凯瑟
（Cather）着迷于19 世纪的农业文化赢得了读者和评论家的尊敬，但她对现代性的不
信任使她在现代主义经典中处于历史上不稳定的地位。
③当然，对二十世纪所发生的
变化的抵制并不一定会使一个人脱离“现代主义者”的标签。④与更原始，更早的时
代重新联系的冲动，是现代主义美学的标志，在破碎，迷幻，机械化的世界中塑造了对
意义的追求。 ⑤[文学评论家]菲利斯·罗斯（Phyllis Rose）解释说，然而，这种
情况在大多数情况下还是很常见的，它是在
20 世纪初期的实验和“使其变得新颖”
的氛围下，以及随之而来的批评话语，即“重视复杂性，模棱两可甚至晦涩难懂”，
这使凯瑟（Cather）贴上了“天真”的标签。⑥传统”和“基本上是怀旧而优雅的”
。⑦实际上，在现代主义研究中，她被视为浪漫的地方作家，与现代思维不可或缺的国

她从十九世纪以来的创新性偏离。⑧世纪小说，包括反英雄主义，弯曲性别的情节叙
事，反现实主义，简单的散文，着重记忆和时间，以及对移民，帝国和种族的探索。
⑨
如今，遇到批评家宣布凯瑟（Cather）成为现代主义者的典范地位的情况并不少见，
这一点最明显的体现是凯瑟琳被凯瑟（Cather）包括在2005 年出版的《美国现代主
义剑桥同伴》（Cambridge Companion to American Modernism）等著作中。


1. 答案：E
解析：本题利用引号可以定位到第二句，但同时注意到本题问的是作者的观点，第三句
也要看。第二句告诉我们Cather’s preoccupation with nineteenth-century 
agrarian culture 帮助她赢得了一些名声，但是
distrust of modernity 使得她
unstable position in the modernist canon；但是随后作者指出，对20 世纪带来
的改变的抵制未必就会使人失去“modernist”的标签。所以，在作者看来，对此的
不同解读，就会导致不同的观点，E 选项正确。其余选项均不能对应。
2. 答案：E
解析：原文说critical discourse…resulted in Cather’s labeling as…，可知
文章提到critical discourse 是要给出Cather 一种标签的判定依据，E 选项正确。

D 选项正确。
A 选项错，选项描述的内容都是第二句的细节部分，以偏概全；
B 错，找不到对应；
C 错，the largest contributors 找不到对应；

文章大意翻译：
①除非官员表现得脆弱，否则没有雄心勃勃的政治家将挑战官员进行连任竞选。
 ②
但是，在试图赢得连任并不显得脆弱的官员却很少没有遭到反对。
答案：D
解析：推断题。前提：任何有野心的政治家都不会挑战竞选连任的民选公职人员，除非
这位官员显得不堪一击。结论：尽管如此，在试图赢得连任时显得不那么脆弱的政府官
员很少没有对手。从文中分析可知，vulnerable 的官员缺乏的是有野心的政治家对手，
因此其对手应该来自于没有野心的政治家，即把限定的部分群体排除在外即可。因此选
D。

常只会引起持续的咳嗽，尽管令人讨厌，但这种咳嗽很少会变得很严重。
 ③因此，
成年人百日咳的发生率不会对公共卫生构成重大威胁。
答案：B
解析：解析：这个文章通过得出成年人感染这个疾病之后症状很轻就直接得出这个疾病
对公共卫生产生的威胁很小，说明作者假设了承认的疾病不会传染给孩子，如果传染给
孩子的话，是有生命危险的。所以
B 选项先取反之后，是能够削弱原文内容的。

①耸人听闻的感觉（主要是针对暴力犯罪的情感内容向广大公众的展示）经常受到谴责，
但这种现象的完整历史尚待记载。 ②基于两个普遍但有些不兼容的假设，学者们倾
向于认为耸人听闻的行为不值得认真研究：首先，耸人听闻的行为本质上是一种商业产

 ③然而，对耸人听闻的
早期历史的探索挑战了这两种假设，并表明它们倾向于掩盖该类型的复杂性和历史性。
1. 答案：AB
A 选项对应这一句“second, that it appeals almost entirely to a simple, 
basic emotion and thus has little history apart from the changing 
technological means of spreading it”，这里的basic emotion 可以支持A 选项。
而B 选项对应这一句“first, 
that 
sensationalism 
is 
essentially 
a

1. 答案：A
解析：定位到文章这一句“While some of this observed wage gap could be due 
to difficulties in measuring workers' talent, it is unlikely that such 


measurement problems can explain everything.”，所以能确定A 是正确的。B 选
项文章没有提到，C 选项说的太绝对了。
2. 答案：C
解析：先看逻辑词moreover，一定是和上一句并列关系。高亮句是一个例子，这个例

文章大意翻译：
第1 段：
①一些女性主义文学学者在发掘长期被忽视的女性作品时，倾向于根据当前的意识形态
标准对这些作品进行评估。②这种趋势，无论如何可以理解，都有一定的陷阱，正如
女权主义者对三十七世纪末至十八世纪初的英国女剧作家的反应所表明的那样。
③
玛丽·皮克斯（Mary Pix），凯瑟琳·特罗特（Catharine Trotter）和德拉里维
耶·曼利（Delarivier Manley）各自至少写了四部戏剧，被统称为“女智慧”。④
这些妇女认为自己参与了共同的努力，但是女权主义学者却以不同的方式评价了她们的
作品。⑤特罗特（Trotter）和曼利（Manley）以其对“女权主义”主题的描绘而受
到赞誉。⑥特罗特（Trotter）因为她坚持女性美德，而曼利（Manley）因为她描绘
了强大的，有时甚至是恶毒的女主角，而皮克斯（
Pix）的作品则以刻板印象中“女
性化”的方式描绘了女性，因此常常被驳回。
第2 段：
①然而，Pix 仅在当前情况下比较保守：在
17 世纪末和18 世纪初的英语戏剧中，
Pix 的戏剧在形式上比Manley 更具创新性，并且比Manley 或Trotter 的戏剧更成功。
②她还在主题方面开辟了新天地，解决了诸如阶级动荡之类的当代社会问题。
③但
是，这些行为很少得到女巫学者的认可。
1. 答案：C
解析：考主旨句，是全文第二句，This tendency, however understandable, has 
certain pitfalls: C 的 shortcomings 对应这句的 pitfall，propensity 对应 
tendency。后文全是举例，举的P/T/M 三个作家的例子即为了证明按照当代意识形态
去点评古代作品的缺陷。
2. 答案：A
解析：A 对应原文第二段：最后一句说 these acts 被 scholars 忽略，these 指

3. 答案：D
解析：考句内关系，原文举 
social 
issues 
这个例子是为了证明前半句的
She 
also broke new ground regarding subject matter P 在一些主题上有新的突破。
D 的 support the claim 体现句内论点论据的支持关系，previously unexplored

 ⑤当希瑟甲虫丰富时，它们的幼虫在富含氮的希瑟芽上生长特别好。
 ⑥用力喂食
幼虫和成虫，然后使灌木丛落叶，从而使希瑟和草丛之间的竞争平衡无可挽回。
1. 答案：C
解析：推断题，根据题干，可以定位到
5、6 句，文章告诉我们大量的heather 
beetles 会导致defoliate the bushes, tipping the competitive balance 
between heather and grasses irrevocably，这个时候其实没有选项能直接跟这个
内容对应，实际上，本题还需要联系第三句的内容，
at first heather usually 
thrives because the grasses cannot penetrate the canopy of its bushes，也
就是说大量的heather beetles 会导致heather bushes 落叶，从而可以推出C 选项。
其余选项在原文中均找不到对应；本题
E 选项容易误选，注意到原文第四句只是说
beetles 的population size 
会varies from year to year，并不能对应
inevitably 和scarcity。
