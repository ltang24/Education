For Blank (ii), we need a word that contrasts with the movement of hydrocarbons in conventional deposits, implying that shale gas stays in its source bed.\n\n**Step 4: Select the best option for each blank independently.**\nFor Blank (i), the correct word is \"generated in\" because it implies the hydrocarbons were created in the deeper source beds. For Blank (ii), the correct word is \"never leaves\" because it contrasts with the movement of hydrocarbons in conventional deposits, implying that shale gas stays in its source bed.\n\n**Answer:**\ngenerated in, never leaves\nExplanation: Conventional deposits of oil and gas are the result of hydrocarbons traveling from their source beds, whereas shale gas remains in its source bed and never leaves it.",
