The blank should represent a negative outcome or consequence of this practice.\n\n2. **Identify key information**: The key phrases in the sentence are \"growing tendency of universities,\" \"reward celebrity more generously than specialized expertise,\" and \"deplored the search for ____________.\" This indicates that the missing word should reflect something negative that arises from the practice of prioritizing celebrity.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: pprobation**: This appears to be a misspelling and does not fit contextually.\n   - **B: ollegiality**: This refers to the cooperative relationship among colleagues, which does not directly relate to the negative consequences of favoring celebrity.\n   - **C: rudition**: This means knowledge or learning, but it does not convey a negative consequence.\n   - **D: enown**: This means fame or renown, which fits well because it reflects the idea of seeking celebrity status, which is what the academics are criticizing.\n   - **E: rowess**: This refers to skill or expertise, which is the opposite of what the academics are concerned about (i.e., the lack of reward for expertise).\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: The most relevant options are D and E. \"Enown\" fits the context of the sentence as it captures the idea of seeking fame, which is what the academics are lamenting. \"Rowess,\" while related to expertise, does not fit the context of the search for something negative that arises from the practice being criticized.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The best answer that fits the context of the sentence, reflecting the negative consequence of prioritizing celebrity over expertise, is \"enown.\"\n\nFinal Answer: D",

We need to find a word that fits this context.\n\n2. **Identify key information**: The key information here is the phrase \"strong belief in all things\" and the example given about the haunted house. This suggests a belief in the supernatural, mystical, or extraordinary.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: lamorous** - This word does not exist in standard English vocabulary. It seems to be a misspelling or a non-word.\n   - **B: nvidious** - This word means likely to arouse resentment or anger in others. It does not relate to beliefs in supernatural phenomena.\n   - **C: uminous** - This word does not exist in standard English vocabulary. It seems to be a misspelling or a non-word.\n   - **D: mpirical** - This word refers to knowledge derived from observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic. It does not fit the context of strong beliefs in supernatural phenomena.\n   - **E: onorous** - This word means burdensome or heavy. It does not relate to beliefs in the supernatural.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: None of the options provided seem to fit the context of the sentence well. However, option A and C are non-words, and options B, D, and E do not relate to beliefs in the supernatural.\n\n5. **Conclude**: Given that none of the options are appropriate, it appears there may have been an error in the options provided. However, based on the context of the sentence, if we were to assume a word like \"superstitious\" or \"mystical\" was meant to be included, that would fit perfectly.

This doesn't fit well because the sentence implies that science is structured against biases, not opportunistic.\n   - **B: anomalous** - This means something that deviates from what is standard or expected. This doesn't fit because the sentence is not discussing science as being unusual or out of the ordinary.\n   - **C: haphazard** - This means lacking any obvious principle of organization. This could fit because if science were haphazard, it would not be a structured approach to research.\n   - **D: collective** - This implies a group effort or collaboration. This does not fit well because the sentence suggests that science is not simply a collective but rather a diverse set of tools.\n   - **E: monolithic** - This means large, powerful, and indivisible.

It could fit if the Labrador duck's extinction is unusual, but it doesn't directly relate to the lack of knowledge about the species.\n   - **B: controversial** - This implies that there is debate or disagreement about the species. While there may be some controversy regarding its extinction, the context focuses more on the lack of data rather than debate.\n   - **C: enigmatic** - This means mysterious or difficult to understand. Given that little is known about the species and its breeding patterns, this word fits well with the context of being poorly understood.\n   - **D: misrepresented** - This suggests that the species has been inaccurately depicted or described.

If she is urbane, it would be expected that she could make a sophisticated movie, so this doesn't fit.\n   - B: **precocious** - This refers to someone who is advanced for their age, particularly in intellect or talent. While it suggests a level of maturity, it doesn't directly imply a simplicity that would contrast with sophistication.\n   - C: **heterodox** - This means unorthodox or not conforming to accepted standards. This could imply complexity but doesn't suggest a simplicity that would be surprising.\n   - D: **fervent** - This means having or displaying a passionate intensity. A fervent demeanor could be expected in someone who creates provocative work, so this doesn't fit.\n   - E: **guileless** - This means innocent, naive, or lacking in cunning.

The word we choose should indicate that the volume is not large or is manageable, thereby emphasizing that the disposal issue is still significant.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - A: **unmanageable** - This suggests that the volume is too large to handle, which contradicts the idea that the disposal problem is of major importance.\n   - B: **troubling** - This implies that the volume causes concern, but does not directly address the size of the volume.\n   - C: **significant** - This indicates that the volume is considerable, which would not support the idea that disposal is a major issue.\n   - D: **small** - This suggests that the volume of waste is minor, which aligns with the idea that despite this small volume, disposal remains a major concern.\n   - E: **deceptive** - This implies that the volume may seem manageable but is not, which does not fit well with the context of the sentence.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: The only option that fits logically with the sentence structure and meaning is D: \"small.\" It suggests that while the volume of radioactive waste is small, the problem of disposal is still significant.

It does not relate to the habits of frogs in a meaningful way and does not fit the context.\n   - **C: ggressive** - While aggression could make it difficult to approach or film a frog, it does not seem to be a unique characteristic of crawfish frogs compared to other species.\n   - **D: ccentric** - This word means unconventional or odd.
