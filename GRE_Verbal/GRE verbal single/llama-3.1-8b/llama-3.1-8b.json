The academics are concerned about the outcome of this practice.\n\n**Step 2: Identify key information**\nThe key information is the concept of \"celebrity\" being rewarded more than \"specialized expertise\" in universities, and the consequence of this practice.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each option**\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA: probation - This refers to a period of trial or testing, which doesn't seem to be related to the consequence of rewarding celebrity over expertise.\n\nB: collegiality - This refers to a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect among colleagues, which doesn't seem to be a direct consequence of the practice described.\n\nC: rudition - This is not a valid word. It seems to be a made-up term.\n\nD: enown - This is not a valid word. It seems to be a made-up term.\n\nE: rowess - This is not a valid word. It seems to be a made-up term.\n\n**Step 4: Compare best choices**\nBased on the analysis, none of the options A, B, C, D, or E seem to be directly related to the consequence of rewarding celebrity over expertise. However, one option stands out as being more plausible than the others.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude**\nGiven the context of the question, the most plausible answer is B: collegiality. The academics are concerned that the practice of rewarding celebrity over expertise will lead to a breakdown in collegiality, as the focus shifts from expertise to fame. This is a plausible consequence, as it would lead to a more superficial and less collaborative academic environment.\n\n**Final Answer: B**",

We are looking for a word that describes a contradictory aspect of the Victorians.\n\n**Step 2: Identify key information**\nThe key information is that the Victorians were both \"something\" and \"cosmopolitan\". The word \"cosmopolitan\" implies a connection to or involvement with many different cultures, often on a global scale. The paradox is that this cosmopolitan nature seems to contradict with the idea of \"something\" that is more isolated or limited.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each option**\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA: **apricious** - This word doesn't seem to fit the context. Apricious means having a taste for or a love of something, particularly sweet things.\n\nB: **nsular** - This word is actually a prefix meaning \"of or relating to islands\".

However, we can look for words that might imply a contradictory aspect of the Victorians.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude**\nGiven the options, we can see that **B: nsular** is the closest to implying a contradictory aspect of the Victorians. The prefix \"nsular\" means \"of or relating to islands\", which could imply a sense of isolation or limitation, which is contradictory to the idea of being cosmopolitan.\n\nHowever, I must note that this is a bit of a stretch, and the question writer may have made a mistake by including this option.
