Evaluate each option:**  \n\n- **A: pprobation**  \n  - Meaning: A period of testing or trial.  \n  - Relevance: Does not fit the context of a negative outcome related to expertise.  \n\n  \n\n- **B: ollegiality**  \n  - Meaning: The cooperative relationship between colleagues.  \n  - Relevance: While it relates to academia, it does not directly connect to the negative outcome of prioritizing celebrity.  \n\n  \n\n- **C: rudition**  \n  - Meaning: Knowledge acquired by learning; scholarship.  \n  - Relevance: This could relate to specialized expertise, but the context suggests a negative outcome rather than a positive one.  \n\n  \n\n- **D: enown**  \n  - Meaning: Fame or renown.  \n  - Relevance: This fits well as it indicates a negative outcome of seeking fame over expertise.  \n\n  \n\n- **E: rowess**  \n  - Meaning: Skill or expertise in a particular area.  \n  - Relevance: This is somewhat relevant but does not capture the negative connotation implied in the question.  \n\n  \n\n**4.

While a burlesque can be assembled from various sources, it does not inherently imply a haphazard assembly.\n   - **B: atire** - This seems to be a misspelling of \"satire,\" which is a genre that uses humor, irony, or exaggeration to criticize or mock.

It could imply that their work is not exciting enough to gain celebrity status.\n   - **B: esoteric** - This means intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with specialized knowledge. This could explain their lack of celebrity since their work might not be accessible to the general public.\n   - **C: compelling** - This means evoking interest, attention, or admiration in a powerfully irresistible way. This would contradict the idea of lacking celebrity.\n   - **D: global** - This means relating to the whole world. It does not seem relevant to the nature of their mathematical pursuit.\n   - **E: univocal** - This means having only one meaning or interpretation.

It does not fit the context.\n   - **B: erfunctory** - This appears to be a misspelling of \"perfunctory,\" which means done as a routine duty, lacking interest or enthusiasm.

Understand the question:**  \nThe question presents a contrast between two types of novelists: those who idealize and exaggerate their work and those who take a different approach. The blank in the sentence indicates that we need a word that describes the second group of novelists, who do not exalt the role of the writer.\n\n**2. Identify key information:**  \n- First group: Novelists who idealize and exaggerate their work.\n- Second group: Novelists who question a transcendent view of art.\n- The blank needs a word that contrasts with \"idealized and exaggerated.\"\n\n**3. Evaluate each option:**  \n- **A: verring** - This is not a recognized word in English.\n  \n- **B: eclining** - This seems to be a misspelling of \"declining,\" which could imply that these novelists are refusing to exalt the role of the writer. This option fits the context of questioning the significance of the writer.\n\n- **C: eeking** - This appears to be a misspelling of \"seeking.\" It does not fit the context, as seeking to exalt would not align with questioning the role of the writer.\n\n- **D: eigning** - This is not a recognized word in English.\n\n- **E: vowing** - This suggests a strong commitment to something, which does not fit the context of questioning or opposing the exaltation of the writer.\n\n**4. Compare best choices:**  \nThe only option that makes sense in the context of questioning the exaltation of the writer is **B: eclining** (interpreted as \"declining\"). The other options either do not exist or do not fit the context of the sentence.\n\n**5. Conclude:**  \nThe most appropriate answer that fits the context of the sentence is **B**.\n\nFinal Answer: B",
