Understand the question:**\n\nThe question asks for a word that means the opposite of how science is described in the passage. The passage states that science is \"not [blank] enterprise\" and is instead \"a motley assortment of tools designed to safeguard researchers against their own biases.\" This implies that science is not a simple, unified, or straightforward process.\n\n**2. Identify key information:**\n\n* **Key words:** \"not,\" \"motley assortment,\" \"safeguard against biases,\" \"opposite\"\n* **Implied meaning:** Science is complex, diverse, and constantly evolving, with mechanisms in place to mitigate researcher subjectivity.\n\n**3. Evaluate each option:**\n\n* **A: n opportunistic:**  Opportunistic implies taking advantage of situations as they arise. This doesn't directly contrast with the passage's description of science.\n* **B: n anomalous:** Anomalous means irregular or deviating from the norm. While science can involve anomalies, this word doesn't capture the multifaceted nature described.\n* **C: haphazard:** Haphazard means random or lacking order. This aligns better with the passage's idea that science is not a simple, unified process.\n* **D: collective:** Collective implies working together as a group. While science involves collaboration, the passage emphasizes the tools and methods used to combat bias, not just the collective nature.\n* **E: monolithic:** Monolithic means single, uniform, or unchanging. This is the direct opposite of the passage's description of science as a diverse and evolving process.\n\n**4. Compare best choices:**\n\nC (haphazard) and E (monolithic) are the strongest contenders.

This could create a contrast, but it's not necessarily the opposite of \"provocative\" and \"sophisticated.\"\n* **B: recocious:**  Means \"carefully restrained\" or \"shy.\" This creates a strong contrast with a provocative movie, suggesting the filmmaker is less confident or outspoken.\n* **C: eterodox:**  Means \"holding unorthodox beliefs.\" This doesn't necessarily contrast with a sophisticated movie, and might even align with it.\n* **D: ervent:** Means \"intensely passionate.\" This aligns more with the movie's description than creates a contrast.\n* **E: uileless:** Means \"harmless\" or \"innocent.\" This creates the strongest contrast with a provocative movie, suggesting the filmmaker is much more subdued and unassuming.\n\n**4.
