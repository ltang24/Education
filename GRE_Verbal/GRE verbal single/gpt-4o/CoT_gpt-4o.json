It asks for a word that describes what this practice leads to, which is something negative that academics are deploring.\n\n2. **Identify key information**: The key phrases in the question are \"growing tendency of universities,\" \"reward celebrity more generously,\" and \"deplored.\" This indicates that the answer should reflect a negative consequence or outcome of this trend.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: pprobation** - This seems to be a misspelling of \"probation,\" which refers to a trial period. It does not fit the context of a negative consequence.\n   - **B: ollegiality** - This term refers to the cooperative relationship among colleagues, which does not relate to the negative outcome of favoring celebrity.\n   - **C: rudition** - This refers to knowledge or learning, particularly of a scholarly nature. While it relates to expertise, it does not imply a negative outcome.\n   - **D: enown** - This term means to make known or to declare. It does not fit the context of a negative consequence.\n   - **E: rowess** - This is likely a misspelling of \"prowess,\" which refers to skill or expertise in a particular area. However, it does not directly relate to a negative consequence of the trend mentioned.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: None of the options seem to perfectly fit the context of a negative outcome of the trend of rewarding celebrity over expertise. However, \"rudition\" (C) is the closest as it relates to knowledge and expertise, which is what is being overshadowed by celebrity.\n\n5. **Conclude**: After evaluating the options, the best choice that aligns with the context of the question, despite not being a perfect fit, is \"C: rudition,\" as it relates to the specialized expertise that is being overlooked.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

We need to fill in the blank with a word that explains why their pursuit might not attract widespread fame or recognition.\n\n2. **Identify key information**: The key information here includes:\n   - Seiberg and Witten\n   - Lack of celebrity\n   - Nature of their pursuit: mathematical exploration of four-dimensional space\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: pedestrian** - This means ordinary or dull. If their work is seen as pedestrian, it could explain a lack of celebrity due to being unremarkable.\n   - **B: esoteric** - This means intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest. If their work is esoteric, it could explain the lack of celebrity as it may not be accessible or interesting to the general public.\n   - **C: compelling** - This means evoking interest, attention, or admiration in a powerfully irresistible way. If their work were compelling, it would likely attract celebrity, so this option does not fit.\n   - **D: global** - This means relating to the whole world. This does not directly relate to the nature of their pursuit in a way that explains a lack of celebrity.\n   - **E: univocal** - This means having only one meaning or interpretation. This does not seem relevant to the context of their work and its reception.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: The two most relevant options are A (pedestrian) and B (esoteric). \n   - If we choose A (pedestrian), it suggests that their work is seen as dull or unremarkable, which could explain the lack of celebrity.\n   - If we choose B (esoteric), it suggests that their work is too specialized or complex for the general public to appreciate, which also explains the lack of celebrity.\n\n5. **Conclude**: Both A and B could be valid, but \"esoteric\" more directly addresses the specialized nature of their work, suggesting that it is not widely understood or appreciated.

This could fit since Strachey's essay allowed for criticism.\n   - **B: sycophantic** - This means excessively flattering or ingratiating. If early biographies were sycophantic, they would have praised Nightingale excessively, which would contrast with the idea of criticism being introduced later.\n   - **C: unsentimental** - This means lacking in sentimentality or emotional appeal. This could imply that the biographies were factual and not emotionally charged, but it doesn’t directly relate to the idea of criticism.\n   - **D: censorious** - This means severely critical of others. If early biographies were censorious, they would have already been critical, which doesn’t align with the idea that Strachey’s essay ushered in a new era of criticism.\n   - **E: pedantic** - This means overly concerned with minute details or formal rules. This doesn’t directly relate to the nature of the biographies in the context of criticism.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: \n   - **A (unsympathetic)** fits well because it implies that the early biographies lacked sympathy, which aligns with the idea that Strachey's essay was groundbreaking in allowing criticism.\n   - **B (sycophantic)** contradicts the idea of criticism being introduced later, as it suggests the biographies were overly flattering.\n   - **C (unsentimental)** is somewhat relevant but does not directly imply a lack of criticism.\n   - **D (censorious)** contradicts the premise that criticism was not acceptable until Strachey’s essay.\n   - **E (pedantic)** does not relate to the context of criticism.\n\n5. **Conclude**: The most appropriate answer is A: unsympathetic, as it aligns with the idea that early biographies did not show sympathy and were not critical, which contrasts with Strachey's work.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

The word that fills the blank should indicate a behavior or attitude that contrasts with the idea of exaggerating or idealizing.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A: verring** - This word does not exist in standard English and is likely a typo or incorrect.\n   - **B: eclining** - This word does not exist in standard English and is likely a typo or incorrect.\n   - **C: eeking** - This word does not exist in standard English and is likely a typo or incorrect.\n   - **D: eigning** - This word does not exist in standard English and is likely a typo or incorrect.\n   - **E: vowing** - This word means to promise or pledge. While it suggests a strong commitment, it does not directly relate to questioning or contrasting with the exaggeration of significance.\n\n4. **Compare best choices**: Since all options appear to be incorrect or non-existent, we need to reconsider the context. The second group of novelists should be characterized by a word that indicates skepticism or a questioning attitude. However, none of the provided options fit this description.\n\n5. **Conclude**: Given that all options are invalid or incorrect, it seems there might be an error in the question itself or the options provided. However, if I had to choose the least incorrect option, I would lean towards \"vowing\" as it implies a stance, but it does not fit the context of questioning.\n\nFinal Answer: E",
