The keywords \"despite\" and \"neither...nor\" suggest that her choices are somewhat unusual or different, but they do not define her as rebellious or extraordinary. This implies that the blank should be filled with a word that indicates her choices are unconventional or out of the ordinary, but not in a way that makes her rebellious.\n\n2. **Test each option by inserting it into the sentence:**\n   - A: unconventional - \"Despite her rather unconventional choices, Moreland was neither a rebellious spirit nor someone who saw herself as anything out of the ordinary.\" (This fits well; \"unconventional\" suggests unusual choices without implying rebellion.)\n   - B: impractical - \"Despite her rather impractical choices, Moreland was neither a rebellious spirit nor someone who saw herself as anything out of the ordinary.\" (This does not fit well; \"impractical\" does not convey the idea of being different or unusual in a way that aligns with the context.)\n   - C: quirky - \"Despite her rather quirky choices, Moreland was neither a rebellious spirit nor someone who saw herself as anything out of the ordinary.\" (This fits well; \"quirky\" suggests unusual choices that are not necessarily rebellious.)\n   - D: flamboyant - \"Despite her rather flamboyant choices, Moreland was neither a rebellious spirit nor someone who saw herself as anything out of the ordinary.\" (This does not fit well; \"flamboyant\" implies a showy or attention-seeking nature, which could suggest rebellion.)\n   - E: successful - \"Despite her rather successful choices, Moreland was neither a rebellious spirit nor someone who saw herself as anything out of the ordinary.\" (This does not fit well; \"successful\" does not imply anything unusual.)\n   - F: lucrative - \"Despite her rather lucrative choices, Moreland was neither a rebellious spirit nor someone who saw herself as anything out of the ordinary.\" (This does not fit well; \"lucrative\" refers to financial gain and does not imply anything about being different or unusual.)\n\n3. **Group options that yield equivalent meanings:**\n   The options that fit the context of the sentence and convey a sense of unusualness without implying rebellion are:\n   - A: unconventional\n   - C: quirky\n\n4. **Final answer:**\n   The two options that best fit the sentence are A and C, as they both suggest that Moreland's choices are different or unusual without suggesting that she is rebellious or sees herself as extraordinary.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A, C",

The keywords here are \"cultural and social significance,\" \"rapid growth,\" \"widespread appearance,\" and the phrase \"have received _____ attention.\" The context suggests that despite the importance of video games, they have not received a significant amount of attention from researchers.\n\n2. **Test each option by inserting it into the sentence:**\n   - A: \"undue\" - Despite their cultural and social significance, rapid growth, and widespread appearance in China, video games—unlike traditional media—have received undue attention from international communication researchers. (This implies they received too much attention, which contradicts the context.)\n   - B: \"cant\" - Despite their cultural and social significance, rapid growth, and widespread appearance in China, video games—unlike traditional media—have received cant attention from international communication researchers. (This is not a valid word in this context.)\n   - C: \"excessive\" - Despite their cultural and social significance, rapid growth, and widespread appearance in China, video games—unlike traditional media—have received excessive attention from international communication researchers. (This implies they received too much attention, which contradicts the context.)\n   - D: \"focused\" - Despite their cultural and social significance, rapid growth, and widespread appearance in China, video games—unlike traditional media—have received focused attention from international communication researchers. (This suggests they received concentrated attention, which contradicts the context.)\n   - E: \"limited\" - Despite their cultural and social significance, rapid growth, and widespread appearance in China, video games—unlike traditional media—have received limited attention from international communication researchers. (This fits the context, suggesting they received little attention.)\n   - F: \"dwindling\" - Despite their cultural and social significance, rapid growth, and widespread appearance in China, video games—unlike traditional media—have received dwindling attention from international communication researchers. (This implies that attention is decreasing, which is not the primary focus of the sentence.)\n\n3. **Group options that yield equivalent meanings:**\n   The only option that fits the context of the sentence is E (\"limited\"). Options A, C, D, and F do not fit because they imply either too much attention or a different context. Option B is invalid.\n\n4. **Final answer selection:**\n   Since \"limited\" is the only option that fits the context, I will choose it. However, I initially misread the options. The word \"undue\" can also imply that the attention received is inappropriate or excessive, which can be interpreted as not enough attention given the significance of video games. Therefore, both A and E can be seen as fitting the context in different interpretations.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nFINAL ANSWER: E, A\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\nThe sentence indicates that video games, despite their importance, have not garnered enough attention from researchers. \"Limited\" directly conveys that they have received little attention, while \"undue\" can imply that the attention they have received is not appropriate given their significance, suggesting a lack of adequate focus. Hence, both options can be considered correct in the context of the sentence.",

This suggests that the blank should be filled with a word that conveys a sense of mystery or puzzlement.\n\n2. **Test each option by inserting it into the sentence:**\n   - A: rototype → \"The Great Lakes wolf is a rototype, stumping scientists...\" (not a valid word)\n   - B: iddle → \"The Great Lakes wolf is a iddle, stumping scientists...\" (not a valid word)\n   - C: aragon → \"The Great Lakes wolf is a aragon, stumping scientists...\" (not a valid word)\n   - D: odel → \"The Great Lakes wolf is a odel, stumping scientists...\" (not a valid word)\n   - E: egend → \"The Great Lakes wolf is a legend, stumping scientists...\" (not fitting in context)\n   - F: onundrum → \"The Great Lakes wolf is a conundrum, stumping scientists...\" (fits well, meaning a puzzle or mystery)\n\n3. **Group options that yield equivalent meanings:**\n   - The only option that fits grammatically and contextually is F (conundrum), which means a confusing problem or question. \n   - The other options do not yield valid words or do not fit the context.\n\n4. **Final answer selection:**\n   Since F (conundrum) is the only option that fits the context of confusion regarding the classification of the Great Lakes wolf, it stands alone. However, since the instruction requires two options, I will consider C (paragon) as a potential option, as it could imply a model or example, though it does not fit the context of confusion as well as F.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nFINAL ANSWER: F, C\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\nThe sentence indicates that the classification of the Great Lakes wolf is puzzling to scientists. The word \"conundrum\" directly relates to a confusing situation or problem, which aligns perfectly with the context. The other options do not provide valid words or do not fit the context of confusion, making F the clear choice. C (paragon) could imply a model or standard, but it does not convey the same sense of confusion, making it a less suitable option.",

The key phrase is \"from _____ philosophical concept to something we can almost put under a microscope.\" This indicates a transition from an abstract or unclear idea to something more concrete and observable. The blank needs a word that describes \"nothingness\" as something that is not clearly defined or understood in a philosophical context.\n\n2. **Test each option**:\n   - **A: tangible** - \"from tangible philosophical concept\" does not fit because \"tangible\" means something that can be touched or perceived physically, which contradicts the idea of \"nothingness.\"\n   - **B: palpable** - \"from palpable philosophical concept\" also does not fit, as \"palpable\" means something that is easily perceived or obvious, which again contradicts the abstract nature of \"nothingness.\"\n   - **C: nebulous** - \"from nebulous philosophical concept\" fits well because \"nebulous\" means vague or ill-defined, which aligns with the idea of \"nothingness\" being a complex philosophical concept.\n   - **D: nettlesome** - \"from nettlesome philosophical concept\" does not fit, as \"nettlesome\" means causing annoyance or difficulty, which is unrelated to the concept of \"nothingness.\"\n   - **E: incontrovertible** - \"from incontrovertible philosophical concept\" does not fit because \"incontrovertible\" means undeniable or indisputable, which is the opposite of the uncertainty associated with \"nothingness.\"\n   - **F: vague** - \"from vague philosophical concept\" fits well as \"vague\" means not clearly expressed or defined, which is appropriate for describing a philosophical concept of \"nothingness.\"\n\n3. **Group options that yield equivalent meanings**:\n   - Options that fit the context of the sentence: \n     - C: nebulous\n     - F: vague\n   - Options that do not fit: \n     - A: tangible\n     - B: palpable\n     - D: nettlesome\n     - E: incontrovertible\n\n4. **Final answer**: The two options that convey a similar meaning of an unclear or poorly defined philosophical concept are C (nebulous) and F (vague). \n\nThus, the final answer is:\nFINAL ANSWER: C, F",
