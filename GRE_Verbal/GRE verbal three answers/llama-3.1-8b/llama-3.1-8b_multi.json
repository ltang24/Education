The correct answer for Blank (ii) is \"alienation\" because it suggests that Hamilton's feelings towards American democracy were complex and conflicted, which is consistent with the passage's portrayal of him as someone who considered American democracy to be a disease.

For blank (i), the correct answer is \"adapted to\" because the passage states that Maiacetus had big teeth suited for catching fish, which implies that it spent some time in the sea. The phrase \"adapted to\" suggests that the animal was well-suited to life in the sea. For blank (ii), \"in the water\" is the correct answer because it is consistent with the idea that Maiacetus had big teeth for catching fish. For blank (iii), \"incompatible with\" is the correct answer because it suggests that the flipper-like feet of Maiacetus were not suited for walking on land, which is consistent with the idea that the animal spent much of its time in the sea.",

The word \"misconstrued\" fits well in the first blank as it implies that people incorrectly interpreted his behavior. For the second blank, \"acquiescence\" aligns with the idea of apparent compliance, as it refers to passive acceptance or submission. Finally, in the third blank, \"detestation\" indicates a strong dislike or hatred, which fits with the idea that Clark secretly resented the authority over him, as suggested by the context of sabotaging projects.",
