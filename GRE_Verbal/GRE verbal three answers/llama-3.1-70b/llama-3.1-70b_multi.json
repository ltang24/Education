The word \"languishing\" fits this context as it suggests a decline or suffering.\n\n3. **Blank (ii)**: If creative work is suffering, the logical response would be to \"extend\" intellectual property law to provide more protection, rather than \"jettison\" or \"relax\" it.\n\n4. **Blank (iii)**: The passage contrasts the idea of unprotected work suffering with the possibility that it might still \"manage to thrive\" despite the lack of legal rules. This indicates that some forms of creative work can succeed without legal protection.\n\nThus, the answers logically fit the context of the passage.",

The passage presents two opposing theories about mountain formation and climate over the past 40 million years. It suggests that one theory posits that mountain building and global cooling are related, and the other theory asserts that mountain building has a specific effect on the earth's climate.\n2. The key transition word in the passage is \"asserts,\" which indicates that the theory being described is making a claim. This helps to identify the correct answer for Blank (ii), which is related to the relationship between mountains and climate.\n3. For Blank (i), the correct answer is \"caused\" because the passage suggests that the theory being described posits that mountain building and global cooling are related, and \"caused\" implies a causal relationship. For Blank (ii), the correct answer is \"feedback between\" because the passage suggests that the theory being described posits that there is a relationship between mountains and climate, and \"feedback\" implies a reciprocal or interactive relationship. For Blank (iii), the correct answer is \"self-perpetuating\" because the passage describes how mountain glaciers tend to increase the reflectivity of the surface, leading to lower temperatures and more ice formation, which is a self-perpetuating process.",
