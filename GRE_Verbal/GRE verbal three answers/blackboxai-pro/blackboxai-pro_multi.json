The first blank is (i), and the options are effect, origin, purpose. The sentence says that the skin has deadly poisons, but the (i) of the toxins has been an enigma. Since they don't know where the toxins come from, the answer here should be \"origin.\" Because the frogs don't produce them themselves, so the origin is the mystery.\n\nNext, blank (ii) has options produce, pressure, suffer from. The sentence says the frog does not (ii) them. If the origin is a mystery because the frogs don't make the toxins themselves, then the correct word here is \"produce.\" So the frogs don't produce the toxins, which is why the origin was unknown.\n\nThen blank (iii) options are eaten, neutralized, poisoned. The analysis suggests the melyrid beetle is the source. Collected beetles had the toxins, so the beetles are (iii) by the frogs. If the frogs get the toxins from the beetles, they must be eating them. So \"eaten\" makes sense. If the beetles were poisoned, that wouldn't explain how the frogs get the toxins. Neutralized would mean the toxins are canceled out, which doesn't fit. So the answer is \"eaten.\"\n</think>\n\norigin, produce, eaten\nExplanation: The first blank refers to the mystery of where the toxins come from (\"origin\"), as the frogs do not \"produce\" them (second blank).

So, the question is about why auctions are becoming more something (blank i), and it's not just new collectors but also established ones whose interests are changing (blank ii), leading them to want certain types of collections (blank iii). \n\nFirst, looking at the first blank. The sentence says that because photographic prints are now popular for collecting, auctions are becoming more... The options are competitive, tedious, or exclusive. Since more collectors are entering the field, auctions would logically become more competitive. More people bidding would drive up competition. Tedious doesn't make sense here because popularity doesn't make something tedious. Exclusive might imply limited access, but the context is about increased activity, so competitive fits best.\n\nNext, the second blank. Established collectors' interests are becoming more... The options are fickle, wide-ranging, or antiquarian. The next sentence says that those who focused on either 19th or 20th-century works now want something else. If they used to concentrate on one era but now want more, their interests are expanding. So wide-ranging makes sense. Fickle would mean changing interests often, but the context suggests broadening rather than being indecisive. Antiquarian relates to old items, but the example includes both 19th and 20th centuries, so it's not just about antiquarian.\n\nThird blank: They want to have... collections. The options are comprehensive, legitimate, impressive. Since they used to focus on one era and now want both, their collections are becoming more complete. Comprehensive means covering all aspects, so that fits. Legitimate doesn't fit here because the context is about scope, not authenticity. Impressive is possible, but the key is that they're including both eras, making the collection more thorough, hence comprehensive.\n</think>\n\ncompetitive, wide-ranging, comprehensive\nExplanation: The first blank refers to auctions becoming more \"competitive\" due to increased interest from both new and established collectors. The second blank describes established collectors' expanding interests as \"wide-ranging,\" as they now seek both 19th- and 20th-century works. The third blank highlights their goal of creating \"comprehensive\" collections that cover multiple eras, rather than focusing narrowly.",

The first blank is describing the \"repertoire of gestural and vocal signals.\" The options are precise, rich, or straightforward.\n\nHmm, the sentence says it's difficult for researchers to tease apart the meanings. If the repertoire is \"rich,\" that means there's a lot of variety, which would make it hard to distinguish individual signals. \"Precise\" would mean exact, which might make it easier, not harder. \"Straightforward\" also seems like it would be simpler, so the opposite of the problem described. So Blank (i) is probably \"rich.\"\n\nMoving to Blank (ii), the sentence refers to \"this (ii)_____\" which refers back to the difficulty mentioned. The options are problem, opportunity, or oversight. Since the difficulty is a challenge for researchers, \"problem\" fits here. \"Opportunity\" would be positive, which doesn't make sense in a context where they're struggling. \"Oversight\" implies a mistake, which isn't indicated here. So Blank (ii) is \"problem.\"\n\nNow Blank (iii): the problem is (iii)_____ by the fact that signals shift meaning. The options are augmented, ameliorated, anticipated. If the signals changing meaning adds to the problem, then \"augmented\" (made worse) makes sense. \"Ameliorated\" would mean the problem is lessened, which contradicts the context. \"Anticipated\" doesn't fit because the shifting isn't predicting the problem but contributing to it. So Blank (iii) is \"augmented.\"\n\nPutting it all together: rich, problem, augmented. The explanation would link each choice to the context clues in the sentences.\n</think>\n\nrich, problem, augmented\nExplanation: The first blank requires a word indicating that the monkeys have a large variety of signals, making it hard to distinguish them (\"rich\" fits, as \"precise\" or \"straightforward\" would imply clarity). The second blank refers to the difficulty researchers face, which is a \"problem.\" The third blank describes how the shifting meanings of signals worsen the problem, so \"augmented\" (increased) is correct, not \"ameliorated\" (improved) or \"anticipated.\"",

So, the sentence is about how the natural sciences are so successful that the word \"scientific\" is used in a certain way. The first blank is (i), and the options are ironic, literal, or honorific.\n\nHmm, the context says that because sciences are successful, the word \"scientific\" is used in a way that implies reliability. So, if something is called scientific, people assume it's reliable. That makes me think the first blank is positive. \"Honorific\" means giving honor or respect, so using it in an honorific way makes sense here. Ironic would be the opposite, and literal doesn't fit because the word isn't being used in its basic sense but rather as a term of praise.\n\nNext, blank (ii) needs a verb. The reliability has been... established? Because if something is scientific, the methods have proven it. Established fits here. Maligned would mean criticized, which doesn't make sense. Challenged is also negative, so not right.\n\nBlank (iii) is about the results not being reasonably... what? The sentence says the methods' results can't be something. Since the reliability is established, the results can't be disputed. So disputed is the third answer. Exaggerated doesn't fit as well, and anticipated is about expecting something, which isn't the opposite of being reliable.\n\nPutting it all together: honorific, established, disputed. The explanation would be that \"scientific\" is used as a term of honor, implying reliability through established methods whose results can't be argued against.\n</think>\n\nhonorific,established,disputed\nExplanation: The first blank (i) requires a term that reflects the positive connotation associated with \"scientific\" due to the success of natural sciences. \"Honorific\" fits, as it implies respect or prestige. The second blank (ii) needs a verb indicating that reliability has been proven, so \"established\" is correct. The third blank (iii) requires a term meaning \"questioned\" to contrast with the idea of assured reliability, making \"disputed\" the right choice. The sentence argues that labeling something \"scientific\" implies its methods have validated its reliability beyond reasonable doubt.",

So, the sentence is about atmospheric methane growth in 1998 and how it relates to global warming scenarios from a 1995 assessment. The first blank is in the first part, describing the observations of a something in methane growth. The options are spike, slowdown, or fluctuation.\n\nThe next part says that because of this observation, the 1995 scenarios may have been overly something. The options here are gloomy, detailed, or ambitious. Then, the third blank is about subsequent research showing the phenomena were caused by declines in emissions, which could be massive, persistent, or temporary.\n\nStarting with the first blank. The sentence mentions that the scenarios were \"overly\" something. If the observations suggested the scenarios were too negative, then maybe the methane growth wasn't as bad as expected. So if there was a slowdown in methane growth, that would mean the 1995 predictions were too gloomy. But if there was a spike, maybe the scenarios were not gloomy enough. Wait, but the sentence says the scenarios may have been overly something. If the methane growth slowed down, then the original scenarios predicting higher growth (and thus more global warming) would be considered too pessimistic (gloomy). So the first blank is slowdown, leading to the second blank being gloomy. But then the celebration was premature because later research found the slowdown was due to declines in emissions. But the third blank: were the declines massive, persistent, or temporary? If the declines were temporary, then the slowdown in methane growth wasn't a long-term trend, so the original scenarios might still be valid. So the third blank would be temporary. Let me check again. The first part: observations of a slowdown in methane growth suggested that the 1995 scenarios were overly gloomy. Because if methane wasn't increasing as much, maybe global warming isn't as bad as they thought. But then the celebration was premature because the slowdown was due to temporary declines in emissions. So the correct answers would be slowdown, gloomy, temporary. Let me check the options again. Blank(i): slowdown. Blank(ii): gloomy. Blank(iii): temporary. That makes sense. The initial slowdown made people think the previous predictions were too negative (gloomy), but it turned out the emissions just temporarily decreased, so the problem wasn't really solved. Yeah, that fits.\n</think>\n\nslowdown,gloomy,temporary\nExplanation: The first blank (i) refers to a \"slowdown\" in methane growth, which led to the conclusion that earlier scenarios were overly \"gloomy\" (ii), meaning pessimistic. However, the third blank (iii) is \"temporary\" because the observed decline was not permanent, explaining why the initial optimism was premature. The logic connects the reduced growth (slowdown) to questioning overly negative predictions (gloomy), later attributed to short-term emission declines (temporary).",

The first part says that both very good and very bad books are easy to review. Then it mentions that praise and something (blank i) come easily. The next part talks about books that are a mix of good and bad, making the reviewer's task more something (blank ii). The third blank is about separating useful observations from the useless ones.\n\nFor blank (i), the first sentence contrasts \"very good\" and \"very bad\" books. If praise is for good books, then the opposite would be for bad ones. The options are ambivalence, compliment, censure. Compliment is similar to praise, so that's not the opposite. Censure means criticism, which fits. Ambivalence is having mixed feelings, but the sentence says it's easy, so maybe censure is better here. So blank (i) is censure.\n\nBlank (ii) says the task is more... when the book is a muddle. The options are evident, demanding, manageable. Since it's harder to review mixed books, the task would be more demanding. So blank (ii) is demanding.\n\nBlank (iii) needs a verb phrase. The useful observations need to be separated from the useless. The options are supplanted by (replaced), sifted from (separated), overshadowed by.

The first blank is about what readers can do with unambiguous texts. Since unambiguous means clear, the readers should be able to understand them quickly. So looking at the options for Blank(i): misunderstand doesn't make sense because if it's clear, they wouldn't misunderstand. Complicate also doesn't fit because the text isn't complicating itself. So comprehend is the right choice here.\n\nMoving to Blank(ii), the sentence says ambiguous texts have an attractive something of multiple interpretations. The word \"attractive\" suggests a positive connotation. Stigma and blemish are negative, so allure fits best as it means attraction or appeal.\n\nFor Blank(iii), the phrase \"equally\" suggests that all interpretations are considered acceptable or legitimate.

The options are disorienting, humbling, or empowering.\n\nHmm, the sentence says \"can feel (i)_____\" and then contrasts with the traditional way of reading. The next part says instead of doing something with the book's organizing logic, you approach it with your own questions. So, if you're not following the book's structure, maybe the feeling is positive. Empowering makes sense because you're in control. Disorienting would be negative, which doesn't fit here. Humbling also doesn't fit the context of feeling like a master.\n\nFor the second blank, the phrase is \"instead of (ii)_____ the organizing logic.\" The options are disregarding, surrendering to, imitating. If you're using your own questions, you're not following the book's structure. So, surrendering to would mean you were previously following the logic, which you're now not. Disregarding would mean ignoring it, but the contrast is between following the author's structure vs your own approach. So surrendering to makes sense here. Because when you do targeted research, you don't have to surrender to the book's order.\n\nThird blank: \"approach the book with your own questions and (iii)_____.\" The options are about the outcome. Since you're the master, you get exactly what you want. Glean precisely what you want fits.

Exotic might refer to non-native species, but the key here is that even species that are currently not at risk are becoming endangered. \"Now common\" makes sense because common species are usually not endangered, but due to human impact, they might become so. \"Vulnerable\" would mean they're already at risk, which contradicts \"even.\" So blank (i) is \"now common.\"\n\nNext, the second blank: \"Ongoing conservation management is (ii)_____.\" The sentence says we can't let nature take its course because we've become nature. So conservation is necessary. The options are ineffective, obligatory, promising. \"Obligatory\" fits here because it means it's required or mandatory. If we've become nature, then we have to manage it, making conservation obligatory. \"Ineffective\" would contradict the need for it, and \"promising\" doesn't fit the necessity aspect.\n\nThird blank: \"responsibilities... cannot be (iii)_____.\" The responsibilities come with the role (of being nature), so we can't avoid them. The options are jettisoned, assumed, contrived. \"Jettisoned\" means to discard or get rid of, which fits here. We can't discard the responsibilities. \"Assumed\" would be the opposite, and \"contrived\" means forced or artificial, which doesn't fit as well.\n\nSo the answers should be \"now common,\" \"obligatory,\" and \"jettisoned.\"\n</think>\n\nnow common, obligatory, jettisoned\nExplanation: The first blank requires a term contrasting with \"endangered,\" emphasizing unexpected vulnerability. \"Now common\" fits, as even currently abundant species face risk. The second blank demands a necessity (\"cannot let nature take its course\"), making \"obligatory\" (mandatory) logical. The third blank requires a term meaning \"abandoned,\" aligning with \"jettisoned\" (discarded). \"Exotic\" and \"vulnerable\" misalign with the contrast implied by \"even,\" while \"ineffective\" and \"contrived\" contradict the context of required action and responsibility.",

The passage is about fairy tales being narratives of wish fulfillment and teaching lessons about struggles in life.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i): The sentence says that the struggle against difficulties is \"an intrinsic part of human existence.\" So, the missing word should mean something that's necessary or can't be avoided. The options are atypical (uncommon), unavoidable (can't be avoided), and insurmountable (can't be overcome). Since the context is about it being a part of existence, unavoidable fits here. So Blank (i) is unavoidable.\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The structure here is \"if one does not __, but steadfastly meets hardships...\" The contrast is between not doing something and facing hardships. The options are preserve, improvise, shy away. Shy away makes sense because it means avoiding, so if you don't avoid (shy away) and face them, you succeed. So Blank (ii) is shy away.\n\nFinally, Blank (iii): The result after overcoming obstacles. The options are elicits adversities (brings problems), emerges victorious, evades achievements. Since the fairy tales have a happy ending, emerging victorious fits. So Blank (iii) is emerges victorious.\n\nPutting it all together: unavoidable, shy away, emerges victorious.\n</think>\n\nunavoidable,shy away,emerges victorious\nExplanation: The first blank requires a word that means \"inescapable\" since the struggle is described as an intrinsic part of existence, making \"unavoidable\" correct. The second blank contrasts with \"steadfastly meets hardships,\" implying the opposite action, so \"shy away\" (avoid) fits. The third blank describes the outcome of overcoming obstacles, which in fairy tales is a positive resolution, hence \"emerges victorious.\"",

The sentence structure is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nThe writer is talking about jewelry-grade diamonds and why they lead to one of two conclusions about the purchasers. The blanks are in the first two parts, describing the diamonds' characteristics, and the third blank is about the goods' nature.\n\nFirst, let's look at Blank (i) and (ii). The sentence says that because diamonds are both (i) and (ii), they prove one of two conclusions. The conclusions are either that the buyers have so much money they can spend on goods that (iii), or they're trying to appear wealthy and go into debt.\n\nSo, the diamonds' two qualities must lead to these conclusions. Let's consider the options for Blank (i): flawless, fungible, expensive. Fungible means replaceable or interchangeable, which might not fit here. Expensive makes sense because if they're expensive, that could explain why someone would need a lot of money or go into debt. Flawless could be a quality, but how does that tie into the conclusions? Maybe not as directly as expensive.\n\nFor Blank (ii), options are durable, useless, irreplaceable. If the diamonds are expensive and useless (since jewelry isn't practical), then buying them would either show you have money to spend on non-practical things or you're pretending to have that money. Durable might not relate as much to the reasoning here. Useless (serving no practical purpose) connects to the third blank, which is \"serve no practical purpose.\" So if the diamonds are both expensive and useless, then purchasing them would be for goods that serve no practical purpose. That makes sense.\n\nSo Blank (i) is expensive, Blank (ii) is useless. Then Blank (iii) would be \"serve no practical purpose\" because the goods (diamonds) don't have a practical use. The other options for (iii) are \"may appreciate\" or \"reflect connoisseurship,\" but the sentence is contrasting two motives: either having so much money they can afford to spend on non-practical items, or going into debt to pretend they do. So the third blank should align with the idea of no practical use, which matches \"serve no practical purpose.\"\n\nPutting it all together: expensive, useless, serve no practical purpose. That fits the logic of the argument presented.\n</think>\n\nexpensive, useless, serve no practical purpose\nExplanation: The argument contrasts two motivations for purchasing diamonds: either buyers have excessive wealth (allowing them to spend on non-essential items) or they prioritize appearing wealthy (even incurring debt). For Blank (i), \"expensive\" directly ties to financial implications. Blank (ii) requires \"useless\" to emphasize the lack of practical value, aligning with \"serve no practical purpose\" in Blank (iii). \"Flawless\" or \"durable\" would not logically connect to the conclusions about wealth display, while \"fungible\" (interchangeable) or \"irreplaceable\" contradict typical diamond marketing. The third blank's \"serve no practical purpose\" directly mirrors \"useless,\" completing the logical chain.",

Let me start by reading the entire sentence carefully.\n\nThe first blank says that watermills were more (i)_____ than windmills. The options are problematic, profitable, or versatile. The next part mentions that windmills could be built anywhere, while watermills (ii)_____. Then, it contrasts by saying watermills had greater capacity and reliability, which provided a better (iii)_____ the money required. \n\nStarting with the first blank. The sentence is comparing watermills and windmills. The second part says windmills could be built anywhere, but watermills (ii)_____. So, the first blank should be a positive trait since the next part talks about windmills' advantage (versatility in location) but watermills have greater capacity and reliability. The first blank is likely \"profitable\" because if they have higher capacity and reliability, they might generate more profit. \"Versatile\" might not fit because windmills are more versatile in location. So blank (i) is profitable.\n\nFor blank (ii), the contrast is that windmills can be built anywhere, whereas watermills... So the opposite would be that watermills needed specific locations, like near rivers. So the option here is \"were suitable only for certain locations.\" That makes sense because watermills require a water source. The other options don't fit the contrast here.\n\nBlank (iii) is about the greater capacity and reliability providing a better something for the money. The phrase \"return on investment\" comes to mind. So \"return on\" the money. The other options like \"source of\" or \"adjunct to\" don't fit as well. So the third blank is \"return on.\"\n\nPutting it all together: profitable, were suitable only for certain locations, return on. The explanation would be that watermills were more profitable despite needing specific locations because their capacity and reliability gave a better return on investment.\n</think>\n\nprofitable,were suitable only for certain locations,return on\nExplanation: The first blank requires a positive attribute contrasting with windmills' versatility in placement. \"Profitable\" fits as watermills' greater capacity would generate more income. The second blank contrasts windmills' universal placement with watermills' geographic limitations, making \"were suitable only for certain locations\" correct. The third blank addresses financial justification, where \"return on\" completes the common business phrase \"return on investment,\" aligning with the economic rationale for watermills' higher upfront costs.",

So, the question is about comparing Japan's first university with Chinese counterparts from the same era. The first blank (i) needs an adjective describing how Japan's university was compared to China's. The sentence says \"since the Chinese Tang system was highly (ii)_____\". Then later, it mentions that Japanese court offices became hereditary, and the examination system (iii)_____.\n\nStarting with the first blank. The sentence structure is \"more (i)____ than its Chinese counterparts... since the Chinese system was highly (ii)____\". The word \"since\" indicates a reason. So, if the Chinese system was (ii), then Japan's was more (i). Let's look at the options for (i): prestigious, egalitarian, profitable. For (ii): aristocratic, reputable, unsystematic.\n\nIf the Chinese system was highly aristocratic (ii), then Japan's might be more egalitarian (i). Because if the Chinese system favored the aristocracy, Japan's being more egalitarian would contrast. The next part says that over time, Japanese offices became hereditary, so the exam system (which allowed students from various classes) would decline. So the third blank (iii) would be something like \"atrophied into insignificance\". \n\nLet me check the options again. For (i), if Chinese was aristocratic, then Japan's was more egalitarian. That makes sense. Then, when the court became hereditary, the exam system that allowed broader admission would weaken. So (iii) is \"atrophied into insignificance\". \n\nSo the answers would be: Blank (i) egalitarian, (ii) aristocratic, (iii) atrophied into insignificance.

The second part of the sentence explains why the first blank is the case.\n\nStarting with the second blank might help. The sentence says \"though there is nothing (ii)_____ the account,\" which suggests that the account isn't bad in some way. The \"though\" introduces a contrast. The third blank is about what parts of the account rely on. If the third blank is something unreliable like conjecture, then the first blank would be negative, like questionable. \n\nLooking at the options for Blank (ii): \"psychologically penetrating in,\" \"inherently implausible about,\" \"fully documented in.\" If the account isn't \"inherently implausible,\" that would mean it's plausible, but the contrast comes from parts relying on conjecture. Alternatively, if there's nothing \"fully documented,\" that would mean it's not well-supported. Wait, the structure is \"though there is nothing [negative] the account, largely parts rely on [something bad].\" Wait, the \"though\" is saying that even though there's nothing wrong in one aspect (blank ii), there's a problem in another (blank iii). So if blank ii is a positive, then the problem is in blank iii. For example, if blank ii is \"fully documented,\" then the account is well-documented, but parts rely on conjecture, making the narrative questionable. But \"though there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean that the account lacks full documentation, which would be a problem. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait, the sentence structure: \"though there is nothing [blank ii] the account, largely parts of it rely on [blank iii].\" The \"though\" sets up a contrast between two things. So the first part after \"though\" is a positive point, but the second part (after the comma) is a negative that undermines it. So if blank ii is a positive, then the account has that positive aspect, but the problem is that parts rely on something negative (blank iii). For example, if blank ii is \"inherently implausible about,\" then \"nothing inherently implausible\" would mean it's plausible, but parts rely on conjecture (which is bad), making the narrative questionable. Alternatively, if blank ii is \"fully documented in,\" then \"nothing fully documented\" would mean it's not well-documented, which is a problem, but that doesn't fit the \"though\" contrast. Wait, \"though there is nothing [blank ii] the account\" — if blank ii is a negative, then \"nothing [negative]\" would be a positive. For example, \"nothing inherently implausible\" (so it's plausible) but parts rely on conjecture. That makes sense. So blank ii would be \"inherently implausible about,\" meaning the account isn't implausible, but parts are based on conjecture. Therefore, the narrative is questionable (blank i). \n\nSo blank (i) is \"questionable,\" blank (ii) is \"inherently implausible about,\" and blank (iii) is \"conjecture.\" Let me check the options again. Blank (i) options: diffuse (spread out), reasonable, questionable. If the account uses conjecture, then it's questionable. Yes. Blank (ii): \"nothing inherently implausible about\" the account, so it's plausible, but parts are conjecture. That contrast makes the narrative questionable. So the answers would be questionable, inherently implausible about, conjecture. Let me check if other combinations make sense. If blank (ii) was \"fully documented,\" then \"nothing fully documented\" would mean it's not documented, which is bad, but the parts rely on conjecture. Then the narrative would be questionable. But the \"though\" would require that the first part is a positive. If \"nothing fully documented\" is a negative, then the contrast would be that even though it's not documented (negative), parts rely on conjecture (another negative), which doesn't create a contrast. So that doesn't work. Therefore, the correct answer is (i) questionable, (ii) inherently implausible about, (iii) conjecture.\n</think>\n\nquestionable, inherently implausible about, conjecture\nExplanation: The narrative is \"questionable\" because the historian relies on \"conjecture\" (unproven assumptions), even though there is nothing \"inherently implausible about\" the account (it isn’t obviously false). The contrast introduced by \"though\" shows that while the account isn’t clearly illogical, its dependence on speculation undermines its credibility.",

The sentence structure is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first blank (i) is in the phrase \"Hamilton came to believe that he was a (i)_____ the United States.\" The options are \"symbol of,\" \"stranger in,\" or \"citizen of.\" The context here is that the author is arguing against labeling Hamilton as a foreigner just because he was born outside the US. The next part says that his feeling (blank ii) was not due to his (blank iii) but because of his confrontation with American democracy. \n\nSo, for blank (i), if the author is saying that calling him a foreigner is anachronistic, then Hamilton might have felt like a \"stranger in\" the US, even though he wasn't technically a foreigner. Because the first sentence says that assuming he's a foreigner is wrong, but the second part starts with \"It is true that Hamilton came to believe...\" which suggests that despite the initial incorrect assumption, he did feel a certain way. So \"stranger in\" makes sense here. If he felt like a stranger, that's his personal feeling, even if the label of foreigner is incorrect.\n\nMoving to blank (ii), the options are alienation, ambition, patriotism. The sentence says his [blank ii] was stemmed not from his [blank iii] but from his confrontation with American democracy. So the feeling here must be something negative, since he considered democracy a disease. Alienation fits because it means feeling isolated or estranged. Ambition doesn't fit the context, and patriotism would be positive, which doesn't make sense with the disease part. So alienation is likely.\n\nBlank (iii) options are ideology, profession, birthplace. The first sentence mentions that labeling him a foreigner is wrong because it uses his birthplace anachronistically. But the sentence here says his alienation wasn't due to his [blank iii], which would be the birthplace, but from his confrontation. So the answer here is birthplace. The author is saying that even though people might think his birthplace (being born outside the US) caused his alienation, it was actually his issues with democracy.\n\nPutting it all together: Hamilton felt like a stranger in the US (i), his alienation (ii) came not from his birthplace (iii) but from his view on democracy. The first part of the passage argues against using birthplace to call him a foreigner, so the blanks need to align with that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nstranger in, alienation, birthplace\nExplanation: The first blank (i) is \"stranger in\" because the sentence states Hamilton felt estranged, contrasting the incorrect label of \"foreigner.\" The second blank (ii) is \"alienation\" as it reflects his emotional distance, which the passage clarifies was caused by his disdain for democracy, not his origin. The third blank (iii) is \"birthplace\" because the opening argument refutes using his birth location to define his identity, emphasizing that his alienation stemmed from ideological conflict, not geography.",

So, the sentence is about a photographer named Friedlander and his approach to places that most people find ugly. The question has three blanks, and I need to figure out each one based on context clues.\n\nStarting with the first blank: \"Just because, as a photographer, Friedlander (i)_____ places that most people consider ugly does not mean that he is out to prove they are beautiful.\" The key here is the structure \"just because he does X doesn't mean he's trying to prove they're beautiful.\" So, the first blank should be something that shows he's engaging with these ugly places, not avoiding them. If he avoided them (option 1), then the next part about not proving beauty wouldn't make sense. If he's critical (option 2), maybe, but the sentence is about his interest. The correct answer here is probably \"is interested in\" because he's focusing on those places, hence the contrast that it doesn't mean he's trying to make them beautiful.\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"the photographer simply cannot ignore so much of the built American landscape but is obligated to (ii)_____ what we pass through day in and day out.\" The phrase \"cannot ignore\" and \"obligated to\" suggests that he needs to record or document these places. \"Document\" fits here. \"Emulate\" would mean copying, which doesn't make sense. \"Discredit\" is negative, but the sentence isn't about disproving anything. So, \"document\" is the right choice.\n\nThird blank: \"regardless of (iii)_____.\" The context is that he's documenting everyday places without considering something. The options are authenticity, truthfulness, aesthetics. Since the places are considered ugly, the disregard is likely about their aesthetic value. So, \"aesthetics\" makes sense here. The other options relate more to truth or genuineness, which aren't the focus here. The photographer is documenting regardless of whether they look good (aesthetics).\n</think>\n\nis interested in, document, aesthetics\nExplanation: The first blank requires a verb indicating Friedlander's engagement with \"ugly\" places. \"Is interested in\" fits because the sentence contrasts his interest with not proving beauty. The second blank needs a verb meaning to record, so \"document\" aligns with the obligation to capture the landscape. The third blank refers to disregarding a quality, and \"aesthetics\" (appearance) is appropriate since the focus is on documenting regardless of beauty.",

The main point is that reserving up to an hour a day for something in school curricula doesn't negatively affect academic achievement. In fact, more exercise might even help school performance despite taking time away from core subjects.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The options are physical activity, leisure time, open study. The context is about reserving time in the school curriculum. The next part mentions \"more exercise,\" which is a clue. So, if the first blank is related to exercise, then \"physical activity\" makes sense here. Leisure time is too vague, and open study doesn't fit with the mention of exercise later.\n\nBlank (ii): The options are contribute to, detract from, correlate with. The sentence says that reserving time for physical activity does not ____ academic achievement. Since the next sentence says that more exercise often improves performance, the first part must mean that it doesn't harm it. So \"detract from\" would mean it doesn't reduce academic achievement. \"Contribute to\" would be positive, but the structure is \"does not\" so we need a negative verb here. \"Correlate with\" doesn't fit the context of cause and effect here.\n\nBlank (iii): The options are diminished, augmented, counteracted. The phrase \"despite the time it took away\" suggests that even though exercise takes time from studies, it actually helps. So the verb here should be positive. \"Augmented\" means increased or improved, which fits. \"Diminished\" would be negative, and \"counteracted\" doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nPutting it all together: Physical activity in the first blank, doesn't detract from academic achievement, and augmented school performance. That makes sense with the overall message that exercise doesn't hurt and actually helps.\n</think>\n\nphysical activity, detract from, augmented\nExplanation: The first blank refers to reserving time for \"physical activity\" in school, as the context later mentions \"exercise.\" The second blank requires \"detract from\" because the studies show no negative impact on academic achievement. The third blank uses \"augmented\" since increased exercise improves performance, contrasting with the time taken from traditional subjects.",

The sentence structure has three blanks, and I need to figure out each one based on context.\n\nFirst, looking at the first blank: \"contributes to the (i)____________ of the argumentative process.\" The suggestion here is that using battle/sports metaphors has a negative effect. The options are analysis, proliferation, breakdown. Analysis seems neutral or positive, which doesn't fit. Proliferation means spreading, but the context is about contributing to something negative. Breakdown makes sense here because if arguments are seen as battles, the process might break down instead of working properly.\n\nNext, the second blank: \"Such metaphors may (ii)____________ adversarial conceptions of argument.\" The metaphors would likely encourage or support adversarial ideas. The options are distort, retard, promote. Distort could mean twisting, but the key is that the metaphors make people see arguments as adversarial. So promote fits here because they are fostering those conceptions.\n\nThird blank: \"thereby (iii)____________ a process that ideally leads to resolution.\" If people act aggressively, the process that should resolve issues is being harmed. The options are presaging (predicting), simulating (imitating), undermining (weakening). Undermining makes sense because aggressive behavior would hinder resolution, thus weakening the process.\n\nPutting it all together: The metaphors lead to the breakdown of the process by promoting adversarial views, which then undermine the ideal resolution.

If they \"made public\" the guidelines, that makes sense because releasing guidelines is a common action. \"Debunked\" would mean they disproved them, which doesn't fit here. \"Refused to consider\" also doesn't make sense because the department is likely creating guidelines, not ignoring them. So Blank (i) is probably \"make public.\"\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The options are \"intangibles,\" \"misconceptions,\" or \"maladies.\" The \"or else\" refers to negative consequences, which are listed as heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes. These are all diseases, so \"maladies\" fits here. \"Intangibles\" are things you can't touch, which doesn't fit. \"Misconceptions\" are wrong beliefs, but the sentence is talking about actual health issues, not beliefs. So Blank (ii) should be \"maladies.\"\n\nFinally, Blank (iii): The options are \"assuage,\" \"plague,\" or \"ignore.\" The sentence says these maladies affect the developed world. \"Plague\" here means to cause continual trouble, which makes sense. \"Assuage\" would mean to lessen, which is the opposite of what's intended. \"Ignore\" doesn't fit because the diseases aren't ignoring the world.

The \"or else\" refers to negative consequences, so \"maladies\" (diseases) like heart disease and diabetes are appropriate.

The sentence has three blanks, and I need to pick the right options for each.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first blank: \"Governments tend to be (i)____________ the Internet.\" The options are ambivalent about, overly optimistic about, or indifferent to. The following sentences give more context. The second sentence says most are truly (ii)____________ its growth and opportunities. Then they mention that countries trying to hold it back look foolish. But the third part says they find the Internet's culture subversive and terrifying. \n\nSo, the government has mixed feelings. On one hand, they see the growth and opportunities (so maybe excited by for blank ii), but on the other hand, they're scared of the libertarian culture. That suggests the first blank is ambivalent about because ambivalent means having mixed feelings. So blank i is ambivalent about.\n\nFor blank ii, the options are unaware of, anxious about, excited by. The sentence says \"its phenomenal growth and the opportunities it offers to both business and education.\" If they're excited by that, then blank ii would be excited by. Because if they were anxious, that would conflict with the positive opportunities mentioned. So excited by makes sense here.\n\nThen blank iii: the transition word. The previous sentences talk about positive aspects (excited by growth, opportunities, not wanting to look foolish). Then the next part is about finding the culture subversive. So the transition is contrasting or adding another point. The options are Moreover, At the same time, Consequently. \"Moreover\" adds a similar point, but here it's a contrast. \"At the same time\" shows that despite the positives, they also have this negative view. So blank iii is At the same time.\n\nPutting it all together: ambivalent about (i), excited by (ii), At the same time (iii). That makes sense because the government has conflicting feelings—excited about the opportunities but also scared of the subversive aspects, hence ambivalent. The transition \"At the same time\" connects the two contrasting ideas.\n</think>\n\nambivalent about, excited by, At the same time\nExplanation: The first blank requires a term indicating mixed feelings (\"ambivalent about\"), as governments recognize both positive aspects (growth, opportunities) and negative ones (subversive culture). The second blank aligns with the positive context of \"phenomenal growth and opportunities,\" making \"excited by\" logical. The third blank needs a contrastive transition (\"At the same time\") to introduce the opposing negative perspective after acknowledging positive attributes.",

The first part says that philosophers of science originally thought of experimental findings as fixed, and theories were built on that data. But then sociologists have shown something different.\n\nLooking at the first blank (i), the original view was that data was fixed and theories were built on them. The contrast here is introduced by \"But,\" so the sociologists' view must be different. The original was one-sided (data is fixed, theories depend on data). So the opposite would be that the relationship is not so one-sided. The options for (i) are \"nebulous at best,\" \"not as arbitrary,\" and \"less one-sided.\" \"Less one-sided\" makes sense here because it's saying the relationship isn't just data supporting theories, but maybe theories affecting data interpretation too.\n\nFor the second blank (ii), the sentence says empirical data may be as [blank] as theories. Theories are usually considered hypothetical or disputable. The options are hypothetical, disputable, consequential. The colon after explains that a well-confirmed theory can reduce something of conflicting data, and unexpected data can question a theory. So data isn't fixed; it's open to dispute. So \"disputable\" fits here. If data were as disputable as theories, that matches the idea that both can affect each other.\n\nThird blank (iii): a theory with strong prior confirmation may reduce the [blank] of a conflicting finding. If the theory is strong, people might doubt the new finding. So the credibility (how believable it is) of the finding is reduced. The options are variance, likelihood, credibility. Credibility makes sense here. Variance would be about variation, which doesn't fit. Likelihood is about probability, but the finding exists; it's about how credible it's considered.\n\nPutting it all together: (i) less one-sided, (ii) disputable, (iii) credibility. The explanation is that the relationship is mutual (not one-way), data can be questioned like theories, and strong theories make conflicting data less credible.\n</think>\n\nless one-sided, disputable, credibility\nExplanation: The first blank requires a contrast with the initial view of a one-sided relationship (data as fixed foundation). \"Less one-sided\" fits, indicating mutual influence.

The third blank addresses how established theories affect new findings; \"credibility\" reflects reduced trust in conflicting data.",

The main point is that political ads have stayed similar since the 1950s, while consumer ads have changed a lot. The blanks are in the reasons for this difference and the type of change political ads resist.\n\nFirst, Blank (i) and (ii) are contrasting. Consumer advertisers value something that leads to evolution, so maybe they value originality. Because if they prize originality, they would keep changing their ads to be new and creative, hence evolving. On the other hand, political advertisers must value the opposite. If consumer ads change because they want originality, political ads don't change much, so they might value tradition or conformity. Looking at the options for Blank (ii): conformity would mean they stick to the same methods, which explains why they don't evolve. So Blank (i) is originality, Blank (ii) is conformity.\n\nThen Blank (iii) is about the type of change political ads resist except for the most something change. The sentence says \"resistant to all but the most...\" which means they only allow a certain type of change. Since they don't change much, the change must be very small or gradual. The options are incremental, which means step-by-step or small changes. So Blank (iii) is incremental.\n\nLet me check the options again. Blank (i) options are caution, tradition, originality. Originality makes sense for consumer ads leading to change. Blank (ii) options: earnestness, conformity, persuasion. Conformity fits because they stick to the same ways. Blank (iii): controversial, incremental, popular. Incremental change is small, so political ads only allow tiny changes over time. That all fits. So the answers should be originality, conformity, incremental.\n</think>\n\noriginality, conformity, incremental\nExplanation: The first blank contrasts consumer ads (which evolve) with political ads. Since consumer ads change, they likely value \"originality.\" Political ads, remaining similar, would value \"conformity\" (adhering to established norms). The third blank refers to political ads resisting change except for \"incremental\" (gradual) shifts, aligning with their resistance to dramatic evolution.",

So, the sentence is about common sense telling the speaker that some people are more (i)_____ than others. Then the claim that these differences are (ii)_____, or that everyone acts only for their own interests, (iii)_____ everyday observations and moral evaluations.\n\nFirst, looking at blank (i). The options are altruistic, adaptable, disciplined. The second part of the sentence talks about the claim that deep down, everyone acts to further their own interests. That sounds like a contrast to the first part. So if the first part is saying some people are more [something], and the claim is that actually everyone is self-interested, then the first blank should be the opposite of self-interest. Altruistic means selfless, so that fits. So blank (i) is altruistic.\n\nNext, blank (ii). The claim is that these differences (in altruism) are (ii)_____. If the claim is that everyone is self-interested, then the differences in altruism must not be real. So the options are growing, illusory, relevant. Illusory means not real, so that makes sense. The claim is saying the differences are illusory, meaning they don't actually exist because everyone is self-serving. So blank (ii) is illusory.\n\nNow blank (iii). The claim that differences are illusory and everyone is self-interested does what to everyday observations and moral evaluations? The first part says common sense tells the speaker that some are more altruistic. So if the claim is that everyone is self-interested, that would go against common sense observations. So the verb here should be contradicts. Because if the claim says one thing but observations show another, then the claim contradicts the observations. So blank (iii) is contradicts.\n\nPutting it all together: altruistic, illusory, contradicts. Let me check again. The structure is that common sense says some are more altruistic, but the claim says differences are illusory (not real) and everyone is self-interested. This claim would contradict the everyday observations where we see people acting altruistically. Yep, that makes sense. The other options don't fit. For example, if blank (iii) was 'explains', that would mean the claim supports the observations, which isn't the case here.

The sentence structure has three blanks, and I need to figure out the correct words for each.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first blank. The sentence says that policies aimed at limiting population growth have been (i)_____, but despite that (\"nevertheless\"), the country's size and isolation mean that human populations in areas with large carnivores (ii)_____. The third blank states that this human pressure has (iii)_____ the South China tiger.\n\nStarting with the first blank: The key word here is \"nevertheless,\" which indicates a contrast. The policies are meant to limit population growth, but even though they've been implemented (or maybe not?), the vast size and isolation lead to something else. If the policies were implemented, then you'd expect population control, but the next part says that in some areas, human populations might still be growing. So the first blank should be a word that shows the policies are in place. The options are modified, deemphasized, or implemented. If policies are implemented, that's a positive step, but the contrast comes in the next part. So \"implemented\" makes sense here. If they were deemphasized, that would mean the policies aren't a focus, which might not create the contrast needed. So blank (i) is probably \"implemented.\"\n\nMoving to the second blank: The sentence after \"nevertheless\" explains that because the country is vast and regions are isolated, human populations in areas with carnivores... what? The idea is that even though there are policies (implemented), in remote areas, people might still be growing. So \"can grow unchecked\" fits here. If the policies are in place but some areas are isolated, those areas might not be effectively controlled. So blank (ii) is \"can grow unchecked.\"\n\nThird blank: The human pressure has done something to the South China tiger. The options are celebrated, doomed, or bypassed. Since human pressure is a threat, \"doomed\" makes sense. \"Bypassed\" would mean the tigers were avoided, which doesn't fit the context of a threat. \"Celebrated\" is positive, which doesn't make sense. So blank (iii) is \"doomed.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The policies are implemented, but in remote areas, populations can grow unchecked, leading to the tigers being doomed. That makes sense with the contrast indicated by \"nevertheless.\"\n</think>\n\nimplemented, can grow unchecked, doomed\nExplanation: The first blank requires a word indicating that population control policies have been put into action (\"implemented\"), contrasting with the ongoing human pressure. The second blank reflects that despite these policies, remote areas still experience unchecked population growth (\"can grow unchecked\"). The third blank shows the negative impact on the South China tiger, making \"doomed\" the logical choice.",

Let me start by reading the entire passage carefully to understand the context.\n\nThe first sentence says, \"The usual (i)_____ spending public monies on scientific projects is that such projects have the potential to make our lives healthier, safer, and more productive.\" The blank (i) is looking for a noun phrase that describes the reason or justification for spending money on science. The options are \"argument against,\" \"rationale for,\" and \"precedent for.\" The part after \"is that\" gives the reason—so the blank should be the reason supporting the spending. \"Rationale for\" makes sense here because it means the underlying reason. \"Argument against\" would contradict the positive outcome mentioned, and \"precedent for\" refers to a past example, which isn't the focus here. So blank (i) is probably \"rationale for.\"\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"However, the fact that science... can strengthen democracy and promote public participation... is hardly ever (ii)_____.\" The word \"however\" indicates a contrast. The first part talks about the usual reason (health, safety, productivity), but this other benefit (democracy) is not often something. The options are \"denied,\" \"mentioned,\" and \"gainsaid.\" \"Gainsaid\" means contradicted or denied, but \"hardly ever gainsaid\" would mean it's rarely denied, which might not fit. If the usual rationale is the main point, this other benefit is not often mentioned. So \"mentioned\" could be the answer. Wait, but \"hardly ever denied\" would mean people agree but don't talk about it. Hmm. Let me think. The sentence is saying that even though science helps democracy, this point is hardly ever... If it's \"mentioned,\" then the idea is that people don't talk about it. If it's \"denied,\" then people don't deny it. But the sentence structure is \"the fact that... is hardly ever...\" So if the fact is true, but people don't mention it, then \"mentioned\" fits. Because the author is pointing out that this benefit is overlooked in discussions. So blank (ii) is \"mentioned\"? Or \"gainsaid\"? Wait, \"gainsaid\" is a less common word meaning to deny or contradict. If the fact is hardly ever gainsaid, that would mean it's rarely contradicted, so people don't argue against it. But the author's point is that this benefit is not talked about, not that it's not disputed. The sentence is contrasting the usual rationale (health, etc.) with another benefit (democracy) that's not brought up. So \"mentioned\" makes sense here. So blank (ii) is \"mentioned.\"\n\nThird blank: \"Scientific literacy (iii)_____ democracy, and this is an important ancillary benefit...\" The options are \"stifles,\" \"energizes,\" \"disregards.\" The author is saying that promoting science has this ancillary benefit related to democracy. Since the previous part said science can strengthen democracy, scientific literacy should have a positive effect. So \"energizes\" would fit here. \"Stifles\" is negative, which contradicts the context. \"Disregards\" doesn't make sense. So blank (iii) is \"energizes.\"\n\nPutting it all together: Blank (i) rationale for, blank (ii) mentioned, blank (iii) energizes. Wait, but let me check again. For blank (ii), the options are \"denied,\" \"mentioned,\" \"gainsaid.\" The sentence says \"the fact... is hardly ever (ii)_____.\" If the fact is true, but people don't mention it, then \"mentioned\" is correct. If they don't deny it, then \"denied\" would be \"hardly ever denied\" meaning people usually agree. But the author's point is that this benefit is not discussed, not that it's not denied. So \"mentioned\" is better. Gainsaid is a synonym for denied, so \"hardly ever gainsaid\" would mean rarely denied, but the author is pointing out that this aspect is overlooked, not that it's accepted. So \"mentioned\" is the right choice here. So the answers are rationale for, mentioned, energizes. Wait, but wait, the third blank: \"Scientific literacy (iii)_____ democracy.\" The author says that promoting science has an ancillary benefit, which is that scientific literacy does something positive to democracy. So \"energizes\" makes sense. Yes. So the three answers should be rationale for, mentioned, energizes.\n</think>\n\nrationale for,mentioned,energizes\nExplanation: The first blank requires a term that indicates the reason for spending public money on science, which is provided by the benefits mentioned (healthier, safer, etc.), making \"rationale for\" correct. The second blank addresses the lack of attention to science's role in democracy; \"mentioned\" fits as the author notes this benefit is rarely discussed. The third blank needs a positive verb linking scientific literacy to democracy, and \"energizes\" aligns with strengthening democratic participation.",

                "model_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this GRE text completion question. So, the sentence is about early natural science practitioners developing methods to remove distortions. These distortions are caused by either the research environment or the researcher. The methods, especially regarding the researcher, were meant to do something to those \"something\" subjectivity. The unbridled expression of that subjectivity was thought to do something else to research.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence structure. The main idea is that methods were created to remove distortions. The methods are targeting two sources: research environment and researcher. The focus here is on the researcher. The blanks are in three parts. Let's look at each blank one by one, but considering the context as a whole.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The methods were considered to (i)_____ those (ii)_____ subjectivity. The methods are supposed to remove distortions, so they probably aim to control or limit the researcher's subjectivity. The options for Blank (i) are restrain, reveal, disguise. If the methods are removing distortions caused by the researcher, they would want to restrain or limit the subjectivity, not reveal or disguise it. Because if you reveal it, that might not remove distortions. Disguise could be possible, but the sentence says \"remove distortions,\" which implies controlling rather than hiding. So likely \"restrain\" for Blank (i).\n\nNow Blank (ii): \"those (ii)_____ subjectivity\". The phrase \"those\" refers to the things related to subjectivity that the methods are restraining. The options are incursions of, restrictions on, acknowledgements of. If the methods are restraining something, it's probably restraining the incursions (intrusions) of subjectivity. Because \"incursions of subjectivity\" would mean the unwanted entry of subjectivity into the research. If they were restraining restrictions on subjectivity, that would mean they are limiting the restrictions, which would allow more subjectivity, which contradicts the idea of removing distortions. Similarly, acknowledgements of subjectivity being restrained doesn't fit as well. So \"incursions of\" makes sense here. The methods are restraining the incursions (the unwanted entries) of the researcher's subjectivity.\n\nBlank (iii): \"unbridled expression was thought to (iii)_____ research.\" Unbridled means uncontrolled. If the expression is unbridled, it would negatively affect the research. The options are corrupt, justification, expedite. Corrupt fits here because uncontrolled subjectivity would damage or corrupt the research. Expedite means speed up, which is positive, but the context is negative. Justification doesn't fit as a verb here. So \"corrupt\" is the correct choice.\n\nPutting it all together: The methods were to restrain the incursions of subjectivity, whose unbridled expression would corrupt research. That makes sense. The methods are controlling the researcher's subjectivity to prevent it from distorting (corrupting) the research.\n</think>\n\nrestrain, incursions of, corrupt\nExplanation: The methods aimed to control the researcher's subjectivity. \"Restrain\" fits Blank (i) as it implies limiting unwanted influences. \"Incursions of\" (Blank ii) suggests intrusive subjectivity that needs containment. \"Corrupt\" (Blank iii) aligns with the negative impact of unchecked subjectivity on research integrity.",

The main idea seems to be that having too many choices can be a bad thing, leading to paralysis.\n\nLooking at the first blank (i), the sentence says that a ___ of choices can be paralyzing, as Schwartz pointed out. The options are surfeit, reduction, stabilization. Surfeit means an excess, which makes sense here because the paradox of choice is about having too many options. Reduction would mean fewer choices, which wouldn't cause paralysis. Stabilization doesn't fit. So blank (i) is probably surfeit.\n\nNext, the second blank (ii). The sentence says that a lack of flexibility in plans might be a ___. Since the previous part talks about how more choices lead to less participation, a lack of flexibility (fewer choices) could be a good thing. The options are virtue, conundrum, revelation. Virtue makes sense here because it's a positive trait. Conundrum is a puzzle, which doesn't fit. Revelation is a discovery, but the context is about benefits, so virtue is better.\n\nThird blank (iii). The sentence says people reasonably ___ some advantages for peace of mind. The options are foresee, forestall, forgo. Forgo means to give up, which fits here. People give up some advantages (like more choices) to have peace of mind. Foresee doesn't make sense, and forestall means prevent, which isn't right. So forgo is correct.\n\nPutting it all together: surfeit, virtue, forgo.\n</think>\n\nsurfeit, virtue, forgo\nExplanation: The first blank requires a term indicating excess (\"surfeit\") since the context discusses choice overload causing paralysis.

So, the sentence structure is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"Although political events in different countries were not (i)_____ in the nineteenth century, their interrelationship was (ii)_____ compared with the present, when interdependence has become far greater: (iii)_____ has ceased to be an option.\"\n\nFirst, let's look at the first blank (i). The sentence uses \"Although,\" which sets up a contrast between the first part and the second part. The first part says that political events were not (i)_____, and the second part talks about their interrelationship being something compared to now when interdependence is greater. So, the idea here is that in the 19th century, events weren't [something], but their connections were [something else], and now interdependence is higher. The contrast here is probably between how connected things were then versus now.\n\nFor blank (i), the options are unconnected, trivial, simultaneous. If the interrelationship was less in the past compared to now, then maybe in the past, events weren't unconnected. Wait, but the first part is \"Although they were not (i)_____, their interrelationship was (ii)_____...\" So \"Although\" introduces a contrast. So if the first blank is \"unconnected,\" then the structure would be: Although events were not unconnected (meaning they were connected), their interrelationship was something (maybe less than now). But the colon at the end introduces the result that isolationism isn't an option now. So maybe in the past, events were connected but not as much as now. So the first blank would be \"unconnected,\" but since it's \"not unconnected,\" that means they were connected. Then the interrelationship was (ii)_____ compared to now. So the second blank would be something like less strong. The options for (ii) are conditional, superficial, transparent. \"Superficial\" makes sense here, meaning their connections were shallow or not deep. So the contrast is: although events were connected (not unconnected), their relationships were superficial compared to now. Then the third blank is about what's no longer an option. Since now interdependence is greater, the thing that's not possible is isolationism. Because if countries are interdependent, they can't isolate themselves. So (iii) is isolationism.\n\nLet me check again. First blank: \"not unconnected\" means connected. So the first part says even though they were connected, their interrelationship was superficial. Then now, interdependence is greater, so isolationism isn't possible. That makes sense. So the answers would be unconnected, superficial, isolationism. Let me check the options again. Blank (i) options: unconnected, trivial, simultaneous. If I pick \"unconnected,\" then \"not unconnected\" = connected. Then (ii) superficial. (iii) isolationism. Yes, that fits. The other options for (i) could be \"simultaneous,\" but that doesn't contrast as well. If events weren't simultaneous, but their relationships were... Hmm, maybe not. The key is the contrast between then and now in terms of interdependence. So the first blank is unconnected, second superficial, third isolationism.\n</think>\n\nunconnected, superficial, isolationism\nExplanation: The sentence contrasts the 19th century with the present. \"Although\" introduces a concession: political events were not *unconnected* (i.e., they had some relationship), but their interrelationship was *superficial* (shallow) compared to today's greater interdependence. The colon then explains the consequence: *isolationism* (avoiding international ties) is no longer viable due to increased global interdependence. \"Unconnected\" fits Blank(i) as its negation implies connection, \"superficial\" contrasts with deeper modern ties, and \"isolationism\" logically concludes the argument.",

The first blank is about the quality of the drawing, which the author says is attributable to using photography as a shortcut. The options for blank (i) are inert, jubilant, or sensuous.\n\nHmm, the second part of the sentence mentions that the resulting art feels static and lifeless. So if using photography as a shortcut leads to that, then the quality described in blank (i) should be similar. \"Inert\" means lacking energy, which matches static and lifeless. So probably inert is the first answer.\n\nNext, blank (ii) is about what photography does to modern arts. The options are \"frequent enervated,\" \"wonderfully enriched,\" or \"inevitably circumscribed.\" The sentence starts with \"Photography (ii)_____ modern arts, but...\" The \"but\" indicates a contrast. The second part says when used as a tracing tool, the art is static. So the first part might be a positive effect, and the second part is a negative.

The sentence says the performances were \"dense and unpredictable and not always easy to digest.\" So, if they're not easy, maybe the performances required something from the audience. The options for blank (i) are \"made demands on,\" \"had to command,\" or \"were sure to please.\" \"Not easy to digest\" suggests that the audience had to put in effort, so \"made demands on\" fits here. \"Were sure to please\" would contradict the difficulty, and \"had to command\" doesn't quite fit the context of requiring effort from the audience.\n\nMoving to the second blank. The sentence says that the techniques wouldn't be ___ anyone interested in music or films. The next sentence mentions they'd seem strange only to people expecting traditional plays. So, if someone is into music or films, the techniques wouldn't be strange. The options are \"contemplated by,\" \"alien to,\" or \"intuitive for.\" \"Alien to\" means unfamiliar, which fits here. If the techniques aren't alien, they're familiar to those with such interests. \"Intuitive for\" might work, but \"alien to\" is a better contrast with \"strange only to...\" \n\nThird blank: The actors think critics' negative comments show the critics ___ their work. Since the performances are non-traditional, critics might not get it. The options are \"lambasted,\" \"exploited,\" \"misunderstood.\" If the critics didn't understand, their derision would be based on that.

The second blank contrasts techniques with what people familiar with music/films would find unfamiliar; \"alien to\" (unfamiliar) is correct. The third blank reflects the actors' belief that critics' derision stemmed from a lack of understanding, making \"misunderstood\" the logical choice.",

The options for blank (i) are lucrative, realistic, unesteemed. Lucrative means profitable, so that fits here. Realistic doesn't directly relate to making money, and unesteemed is the opposite of what we need.\n\nNext, the second blank: the publication is erudite and (ii)____ but not lively and readable. The contrast here is between being scholarly and maybe something positive versus not being lively. The options are authoritative, animated, trendy. Animated would mean lively, but the sentence says it's NOT lively, so animated can't be right. Authoritative pairs well with erudite, so that makes sense. Trendy might not fit the context of a serious journal.\n\nThird blank: (iii)_____, accompanied by aversion to risk, has pervaded its pages. The options are originality, impulsiveness, staleness. Since they mention aversion to risk, something negative like staleness would make sense. Originality would require risk-taking, so that's opposite. Impulsiveness is risky too, so the answer here is staleness.

So, the question is about how cultures influence attitudes and beliefs, and the blanks need to be filled with the correct options. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe sentence structure is a bit complex. The first part says that cultures can shape attitudes and beliefs in ways that (i)_____ conscious awareness or control. Then it explains that cultural orientations develop from processes that don't involve (ii)_____ participation, and cultures might affect psychological dynamics subtly so individuals can't (iii)_____ them. The last sentence mentions implicit cognition, which is about unconscious processes, so that's a clue.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The phrase \"operate outside of\" makes sense here because if something operates outside of conscious awareness, it means it's happening without people being aware. The other options, \"tend to facilitate\" would mean cultures help awareness, which contradicts the later part about implicit processes. \"May not alter\" doesn't fit because the point is that the shaping happens without needing awareness, not that it doesn't change it. So Blank (i) is \"operate outside of\".\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The sentence says cultural orientations develop from processes that don't require (ii) participation. The key here is that the processes are not involving active participation. \"Active\" participation would mean people are consciously involved, but the context suggests it's happening without their deliberate effort. \"Random\" or \"rote\" don't fit as well. \"Rote\" is about mechanical repetition, but the contrast here is between active and passive. So Blank (ii) is \"active\".\n\nFor Blank (iii): The last part says individuals may not be able to (iii) the subtle psychological dynamics. Since these dynamics are implicit (unconscious), people can't report them. \"Maintain\" or \"condone\" don't fit. \"Report\" makes sense because if you're not aware, you can't describe or report it. So Blank (iii) is \"report\".\n\nPutting it all together: operate outside of, active, report. The explanation ties into implicit cognition, which deals with unconscious processes, so the answers align with that theme.\n</think>\n\noperate outside of,active,report\nExplanation: The first blank requires a phrase indicating that cultural influences happen without conscious awareness, so \"operate outside of\" fits.

So, the sentence is about publishers, publicists, and broadcasters loving anniversaries because they turn historical events into something in a certain type of culture. Then, it mentions patriotic sentiment and national pride wrapped in history to create a mythical past that's useful for public something.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i). The key here is that these groups (publishers, etc.) love anniversaries because they make historical events into something they can use. The options are \"elusive moments,\" \"marketable artifacts,\" or \"raging controversies.\" Since the sentence is about how these occasions are used by media and businesses, \"marketable artifacts\" makes sense because they can be sold or marketed. \"Elusive\" doesn't fit because they're making them into something tangible. \"Controversies\" might not align with the positive spin of patriotic sentiment.\n\nNext, Blank (ii) is about the type of culture. The options are \"authentic,\" \"commercial,\" or \"elitist.\" Since the context is about making things marketable, \"commercial culture\" fits here. They're turning anniversaries into products for sale, so a commercial culture of celebration makes sense. Authentic would contradict the idea of manufacturing a mythical past, and elitist doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nFor Blank (iii), the sentence says the mythical past is serviceable for public something. The options are consumption, scrutiny, censure. Public consumption is about the public using or buying into the manufactured past. Scrutiny or censure would imply criticism, which doesn't fit the context of using it for patriotic sentiment and pride. So \"consumption\" is the right choice here.\n\nPutting it all together: marketable artifacts in a commercial culture for public consumption. That makes sense because the anniversaries are turned into products (marketable) in a commercial setting, which the public then consumes.\n</think>\n\nmarketable artifacts, a commercial, consumption\nExplanation: The first blank refers to historical events becoming \"marketable artifacts\" because publishers and broadcasters aim to profit from them. The second blank is \"a commercial\" culture, as anniversaries are commodified. The third blank is \"consumption,\" indicating the public's passive acceptance of the manufactured narrative.",

The structure has three blanks, and I need to figure out each one based on the context.\n\nFirst, the passage says that laws are meant to stimulate creativity, but some creative work hasn't been legally protected. The first blank is in a part where it's talking about if certain creative endeavors are (i)_____ because of uncontrolled copying. The options are languishing, proliferating, or diversifying. If there's uncontrolled copying, maybe that's bad for the creators. So if their work is languishing, that means it's suffering. That makes sense because without protection, maybe people copy too much and the original creators can't benefit, so their work doesn't thrive. So blank (i) is probably \"languishing.\"\n\nThen, the second blank: if the creative work is languishing, the decision would be to do something about the intellectual property law. The options are jettison, extend, or relax. If the problem is that copying is causing the work to suffer, then maybe they need to extend the law to cover those forms. Because currently, those forms aren't protected. So extending the law would help. So blank (ii) is \"extend.\"\n\nThe third part is the converse. If unprotected work (iii)_____ without legal rules against copying. The options are declines in originality, manages to thrive, or openly invites imitation. The sentence says if this happens, we should know how such flourishing is sustained. So the converse situation is that even without protection, the work thrives. So blank (iii) is \"manages to thrive.\"\n\nLet me check again. First blank: if copying is uncontrolled, the work would languish (not do well), so we need to extend the law. Conversely, if without protection, the work thrives, then we need to understand how. That fits. So the answers should be languishing, extend, manages to thrive.\n</think>\n\nlanguishing,extend,manages to thrive\nExplanation: The first blank (i) requires a term indicating negative consequences of uncontrolled copying. \"Languishing\" (failing to thrive) fits, as it contrasts with the goal of stimulating creativity. The second blank (ii) follows logically: if creativity suffers, we would \"extend\" legal protections to more forms of work. The third blank (iii) contrasts with the first scenario, so \"manages to thrive\" aligns with the idea of unprotected work flourishing despite copying, prompting curiosity about its sustainability.",

The sentence structure is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"Despite the (i)____________ nature of contemporary science...\" The word \"Despite\" indicates a contrast between the first part and the rest of the sentence. So whatever is in blank (i) is something that you might expect would lead to a certain outcome, but the reality is different.\n\nLooking at the options for blank (i): collaborative, controversial, sophisticated. Let's think. The main clause after the comma talks about how the work of women and minorities has been exploited or considered unworthy. So the first part is setting up a contrast. If contemporary science is collaborative (working together), maybe you'd expect everyone's contributions to be recognized. But despite that collaboration, their contributions are still overlooked. That makes sense. Alternatively, if it's controversial or sophisticated, would that contrast? Maybe, but collaborative seems more directly related to the idea of including people's work. So maybe (i) is collaborative.\n\nNext, blank (ii) and (iii) are in the same part: \"the (ii)____________ of many individuals (iii)____________:\" The colon after that introduces the explanation. The explanation says that their work has been exploited or deemed unworthy. So the part before the colon must be saying that their contributions are not recognized. So blank (ii) is probably \"contributions\" because that's what's being exploited or overlooked. Then blank (iii) would be \"remain overlooked\" because despite the collaborative nature, their contributions are still not acknowledged. \n\nPutting it all together: Despite science being collaborative (which should promote inclusion), the contributions of many individuals remain overlooked. The colon then explains how their work is exploited or excluded. That fits. Let me check the other options. If (i) was controversial, the contrast might not be as clear. Sophisticated doesn't directly relate. So collaborative makes sense. For (ii), motivations or idiosyncrasies don't fit as well as contributions. And (iii) \"remain overlooked\" matches the idea that their work isn't included in history books. So the answers should be collaborative, contributions, remain overlooked.\n</think>\n\ncollaborative,contributions,remain overlooked\nExplanation: The sentence contrasts the collaborative nature of modern science with the failure to recognize certain groups' work. \"Collaborative\" (Blank i) sets up the expectation of inclusivity, which is contradicted by the exploitation/exclusion described after the colon. \"Contributions\" (Blank ii) directly refers to the work of scientists that is being ignored, and \"remain overlooked\" (Blank iii) logically completes the idea that these efforts are not acknowledged in history.",

So, the question is about children's truthfulness and lying, and how they relate to virtues and skills. The first blank is (i), then (ii), and (iii). Let me read through the passage again carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says that because children have active fantasy lives, one might think truthfulness is a certain type of virtue, but lying is a more something skill. Then it explains that lying requires recognizing the truth, creating an alternate reality, and selling it. So lying does something to cognitive development and social skills that honesty doesn't.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The options are instinctive, acquired, or conscious. The sentence starts with \"given children's active fantasy lives,\" which might make someone think that truthfulness is natural or not learned. But the \"but\" introduces a contrast. If lying is the more advanced skill, then maybe truthfulness is something they don't have to learn as much. So if lying is acquired, then truthfulness might be instinctive. Wait, but the first part says \"might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue,\" but the reality is that lying is more advanced. So maybe the initial thought is that truthfulness is instinctive, but actually, it's acquired? Or the other way around. Wait, the structure is \"one might think X, but it turns out Y.\" So the first blank is what people might assume, given that children have active fantasies. If they have active imaginations, maybe people think truthfulness is not natural, but the contrast is that lying is more advanced. Hmm. Let me think. If children are naturally imaginative, maybe people think that truthfulness is something they have to learn (acquired), but the correct answer might be the opposite. Wait, the first part is \"might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue,\" but the reality is that lying is more advanced. So if lying is a skill that's more advanced, then perhaps truthfulness is considered an instinctive virtue. Because people might assume that telling the truth is natural, but lying requires more effort. So Blank (i) would be \"an instinctive\" because the contrast is that lying is a more advanced (ii) skill. So (i) is instinctive, (ii) advanced. Then Blank (iii) is \"demands\" because lying requires cognitive development and social skills. Let me check the third blank. The sentence says \"lying (iii)_____ cognitive development and social skills in a way that honesty simply does not.\" So lying does something that honesty doesn't. The options are undermines, forgoes, demands. Since the previous sentence says that a child who lies must recognize the truth, conceive an alternate reality, and sell it. So lying requires those things. Therefore, lying \"demands\" cognitive development. So (iii) is demands. Putting it all together: (i) an instinctive, (ii) advanced, (iii) demands. Let me check the options again. Blank (i): an instinctive virtue. The idea is that people might think truthfulness is natural (instinctive) in kids, but lying is actually a more advanced skill. That makes sense. Because if you think kids are naturally truthful, but the reality is that lying is a developed skill. Then the explanation says that lying requires more cognitive steps, so it's more advanced. So the answers are: acquired? Wait, wait. Wait, the first blank is what people think. If children have active fantasy lives, maybe people think that truthfulness is not instinctive, but the answer is the opposite. Wait, maybe I got that reversed. Let me re-examine. The first part: \"Given children's active fantasy lives, one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue in young children, but it turns out that lying is the more (ii)_____ skill.\" So the logic is that because kids have active fantasies (which might be associated with lying), people might think that truthfulness is not natural (i.e., they have to learn it, so acquired). But the \"but\" introduces that lying is more advanced. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. If children are naturally imaginative (fantasy lives), maybe people assume that lying comes naturally, but the truth is that truthfulness is instinctive. Wait, no. The structure is that people might think truthfulness is X, but lying is more Y. The key is that lying is a more advanced skill. So if lying is advanced, then perhaps people think truthfulness is basic or instinctive, but actually, lying is harder. So the first blank is \"an instinctive\" because people might think that telling the truth is natural (instinctive), but lying is a more advanced (ii) skill. Then the third blank is \"demands\" because lying requires cognitive development. So the answers would be: an instinctive, advanced, demands. That seems right. Let me check the options again. Yes, Blank (i) options are instinctive, acquired, conscious. If the first blank is \"an instinctive\" virtue, then the reasoning is that people think kids are naturally truthful (instinctive), but actually lying is a more advanced skill. Then the explanation in the next sentences supports that lying requires more cognitive steps, hence advanced. And the third blank is \"demands\" because lying requires those skills. So the answers are: an instinctive, advanced, demands.\n</think>\n\nanswer1, answer2, answer3\nan acquired, advanced, demands\nExplanation: The first blank (i) requires a term contrasting the idea that lying is a developed skill. Since the passage later explains lying requires complex cognitive steps, truthfulness is mistakenly assumed to be \"an acquired\" virtue (learned), but the contrast reveals lying is actually more \"advanced\" (ii). The third blank (iii) must show lying requires (\"demands\") cognitive and social skills, as the process of lying involves active mental effort, unlike honesty.",

The passage is about traditional Vietnamese culture promoting gender equality, but there's a contrast between theory and reality.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i): The sentence says founding myths do something regarding the equal division of labor. Since the first part mentions promoting gender equality, the myths would likely support that idea. So the options are \"celebrate\" (positive), \"obscure\" (hide), or \"countermand\" (contradict). \"Celebrate\" makes sense here because myths would highlight the equality.\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The sentence contrasts theoretical commitments with actual processes. The phrase \"as is often the case\" suggests that theories don't match reality. The options are \"incommensurate with\" (not matching), \"surpassed by\" (exceeded), or \"inspired by.\" \"Incommensurate with\" fits here, meaning the theories don't align with reality.\n\nBlank (iii): The last part says that in reality, gender-based something persists. Since the first part talks about equality, the reality must be the opposite. The options are \"stratification\" (hierarchy), \"parity\" (equality), or \"inclusiveness.\" \"Stratification\" is the opposite of equality, so that's the right choice.\n</think>\n\ncelebrate, incommensurate with, stratification\nExplanation: The first blank requires a positive verb about gender equality in founding myths, making \"celebrate\" appropriate. The second blank contrasts theoretical commitments with reality, so \"incommensurate with\" fits. The third blank needs a term opposing equality, hence \"stratification\" (hierarchical division).",

So, the sentence structure is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"Despite their (i)____________ superior financial and organizational resources...\" The word \"despite\" indicates a contrast. So, even though these pulp and paper firms had something related to superior resources, they couldn't impose their will. The options for blank (i) are remoteness from, ignorance of, or access to. If they had \"access to\" superior resources, that makes sense. Because having access would logically give them an advantage, but despite that, they still couldn't impose their will. The other options don't fit as well. \"Remoteness from\" resources would mean they don't have them, which wouldn't contrast with not being able to impose. Similarly, \"ignorance of\" resources would also imply they don't use them. So blank (i) is probably \"access to\".\n\nMoving to blank (ii): \"Nor could they assume that properly functioning markets... would (ii)____________.\" The sentence is saying that they couldn't just assume the markets would do something on their own. The options are spontaneously emerge, ultimately fail, or occasionally struggle. If they can't assume the markets would \"spontaneously emerge,\" that fits. Because if you're moving into a new area, you might need to set up markets rather than expecting them to just appear. \"Ultimately fail\" or \"occasionally struggle\" would mean the markets don't work, but the next part says they had to develop strategies to do something with the markets. So they probably needed to create the markets, hence expecting them to emerge on their own wasn't possible. So blank (ii) is \"spontaneously emerge\".\n\nFor blank (iii): \"they had to develop strategies to (iii)____________ such markets...\" The strategies would be to build or create the markets since they couldn't assume they'd emerge. The options are construct, restrain, or serve. \"Construct\" makes sense here because they need to build the markets. \"Restrain\" would be limiting them, which doesn't fit the context. \"Serve\" would mean they work for the markets, but the context is about creating them. So blank (iii) is \"construct\".\n\nPutting it all together: Despite having access to resources, they couldn't impose their will. They couldn't expect markets to emerge on their own, so they had to construct them. The explanation checks out with the contrast and the flow of the sentence.\n</think>\n\naccess to, spontaneously emerge, construct\nExplanation: The first blank requires a phrase indicating possession of resources, so \"access to\" fits. The second blank contrasts with the need to develop strategies, implying markets wouldn't form on their own (\"spontaneously emerge\"). The third blank aligns with actively creating markets (\"construct\") rather than restraining or serving them.",

The sentence structure has three blanks, and I need to figure out each one based on context clues.\n\nStarting with the first blank: \"In adolescence, (i)_____ interactions are crucial in forging a self-identity.\" The options are adult, wide-ranging, or peer. Since the paragraph is about adolescence and forming self-identity, I remember that peer interactions are really important during teenage years. Teens often look to their peers more than adults when forming their identity. So blank (i) is probably \"peer\".\n\nNext, the second blank: \"this process often plays out in (ii)_____ as a means of defining and shoring up the sense of self.\" The options here are cliquish social behavior, dramatic changes in personality, or heightened sociability. The sentence mentions kids seeking like-minded companions and spurning others. That sounds like forming cliques, which is cliquish behavior. So blank (ii) should be \"cliquish social behavior\".\n\nThird blank: \"this in-group (iii)_____ generally evolves into a more mature friendship pattern.\" The options are alienation, clustering, or competition. The previous sentence talks about seeking out similar peers and forming groups. \"In-group clustering\" makes sense here because clustering refers to grouping together. So blank (iii) is \"clustering\".\n\nPutting it all together: peer interactions are key, cliquish behavior is how they define themselves, and clustering evolves into mature friendships. The other options don't fit as well. For example, \"alienation\" or \"competition\" in the third blank would contradict the idea of forming friendships. So the answers are peer, cliquish social behavior, clustering.\n</think>\n\npeer, cliquish social behavior, clustering\nExplanation: The first blank requires \"peer\" because adolescent identity formation primarily occurs through interactions with equals (peers). The second blank fits \"cliquish social behavior\" as the context describes defining the self by seeking like-minded companions and rejecting others, a hallmark of cliques. The third blank requires \"clustering\" since it refers to the natural grouping behavior of in-groups, which later matures into broader friendships. Other options like \"alienation\" or \"competition\" contradict the developmental progression described.",

The sentence is about the myth that Marco Polo introduced pasta to the Western world after his trip to China. The first blank (i) needs a verb that describes what the myth does. The myth claims that nothing was known about pasta in Italy before 1295. So the verb here should be something like \"assumes\" or \"requires.\" Looking at the options for Blank(i): \"requires\" seems to fit because the myth is based on the necessity that pasta wasn't known until Marco Polo's return. \"Demonstrated\" doesn't make sense because the myth isn't proving something, it's asserting. \"Symbolizes\" is too abstract.\n\nNext, Blank(ii) is about how the myth can be dealt with. The sentence says the myth can be easily... by pointing out Italian references to pasta that... So if there are references that exist before 1295, then the myth is proven wrong. The options here are \"augmented\" (which would mean making it stronger, which doesn't fit), \"debunked\" (exposing as false), and \"traced.\" \"Debunked\" makes sense because showing earlier references would disprove the myth.\n\nFor Blank(iii), the Italian references must predate Marco Polo's return in 1295. The options are \"praise its virtues,\" \"can be authenticated,\" or \"predate that event.\" \"Predate that event\" directly refers to the time before 1295, which would debunk the myth. The other options don't address the timeline, which is crucial here.\n\nSo putting it all together: The myth requires that pasta wasn't known until 1295, but it's debunked by references that predate that event.\n</think>\n\nrequires, debunked, predate that event\nExplanation: The myth \"requires\" (implies a necessity) that pasta was unknown in Italy before Marco Polo's return. It is \"debunked\" (proven false) by evidence of Italian pasta references that \"predate that event\" (exist before 1295). \"Symbolizes\" and \"demonstrated\" don't fit the myth's assertion, while \"augmented\" or \"traced\" would contradict the refutation. \"Predate\" directly addresses the timeline contradiction.",

The options are malady, indiscretion, prognosis. \"Broken bones\" and \"liver complaints\" are both health issues. \"Malady\" means a disease or ailment, which fits here. \"Indiscretion\" is more about bad judgment or behavior, which doesn't make sense. \"Prognosis\" is a forecast of disease progression, not the condition itself. So Blank (i) is malady.\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The local mud, saltwater, etc., have been deemed ____ by the German medical system. The options are healthful, suspect, innocuous. The next part says the medical system does something that leads to the treatments being widely used. If the medical system approves them, they must consider them beneficial. \"Healthful\" means promoting health, which makes sense. \"Suspect\" would imply doubt, but the treatments are used widely, so that's unlikely. \"Innocuous\" means harmless, but just being harmless doesn't explain why they're funded and used. So Blank (ii) is healthful.\n\nBlank (iii): The German medical system ____ some of these treatments. The options are doubts, denies, funds. Since the treatments are widely used, the medical system must support them. \"Funds\" means providing money, which would explain their widespread use. \"Denies\" or \"doubts\" would contradict the fact that they're used.

The first part says he's using an innovative method, but the second part is saying that despite that, the study is about something that's maybe not new. The phrase \"yet another examination\" suggests that this area has been studied a lot before. So for blank (i), we need a word that means something that's been done a lot. The options are unfamiliar, well-worked, or fruitful. \"Well-worked\" makes sense here because it means a topic that's been thoroughly explored. \"Unfamiliar\" would contradict the idea that it's \"yet another\" study, and \"fruitful\" doesn't fit the context of being over-studied.\n\nNext, the second part of the sentence mentions that the Norwegian subculture is a well-studied area. The next sentence says that anyone familiar with existing work will (ii)_____ little in Thaler's study that is (iii)_____. For blank (ii), the options are find, understand, reveal. The structure here is that scholars won't find much that's new. So \"find\" fits here. If they \"find little,\" that means there's not much there. \"Understand\" or \"reveal\" don't fit as well because the sentence is about discovering something in the study, not about comprehension or revealing information.\n\nFor blank (iii), the options are accurate, new, recognizable. Since the area is well-studied, Thaler's study probably doesn't offer anything new. So \"new\" is the right choice here. If it's not new, then scholars familiar with the field wouldn't find anything original. \"Accurate\" doesn't make sense because the problem isn't about correctness, and \"recognizable\" would imply that it's familiar, but the contrast is about innovation vs. repetition.\n\nPutting it all together: The study is on well-worked ground, so scholars will find little that's new. The contrast between the innovative method and the over-studied topic supports this.

If it's \"consensus regarding,\" that would mean they mostly agree, but the sentence structure might not fit. \"Compunction about\" means hesitation or guilt, so if they have little compunction, they don't hesitate to make the link. \"Justification for\" would mean they lack reasons, but the sentence seems to say they do make the link. So \"compunction about\" makes sense here because biologists don't feel hesitant to connect the two.\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The link is between humanity's success and human (ii)____. The options are resilience, sociability, uniqueness. The third blank's answer might help here. The third blank is about the ability to do something that makes individuals subordinate self-interest to the group. That sounds like cooperation, which is part of sociability.

Also, altering the brain can produce \"startlingly\" results. The author seems to be arguing that neuroscience's implications are more significant. So, if the effects are more predictable and thorough, maybe the ethical issues are more concerning. So blank (i) might be \"even more troubling.\"\n\nNext, the second blank: \"Even if the ethical and practical constraints on genetic experimentation suddenly (ii)____________, we'd have to wait decades...\" The options are solidified, surfaced, vanished. The sentence is saying that even if those constraints went away, it would still take time. So the constraints must be something that, if removed, would allow experiments. So \"vanished\" makes sense here. If constraints vanished, you could do experiments, but still have to wait.\n\nThird blank: \"Altering the brain's functioning... can produce startlingly (iii)____________ results.\" The options are unexpected, rapid, far-reaching. The contrast here is with genetics, where you wait decades. So altering the brain's effects would be quicker. The previous part mentions that with genetics, you wait decades, but brain changes can show results faster. So \"rapid\" fits here. Also, \"startlingly rapid\" makes sense because it's a quick outcome compared to waiting for genetic changes.\n\nPutting it all together: Blank (i) is \"even more troubling,\" (ii) is \"vanished,\" and (iii) is \"rapid.\" Let me check again.

The sentence structure is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nThe first blank is part of the main clause: \"The power of laughter to affect the perceived funniness of television programming is (i)____________: ...\" The colon here indicates that the rest of the sentence explains or elaborates on the first part. \n\nLooking at the options for Blank (i): cumulative, measurable, unclear. The sentence after the colon talks about what researchers have found. If most researchers have found something, that suggests that the effect isn't unclear. So maybe \"unclear\" is not the right choice here. The colon is introducing evidence or explanation, so the first blank should be something that the following information supports. If the effect is \"measurable,\" then the research findings would support that. \"Cumulative\" might mean it builds up over time, but the sentence doesn't mention time or accumulation. So Blank (i) is probably \"measurable.\"\n\nMoving to Blank (ii): \"most researchers have found that the inclusion of laughter on a program's soundtrack (ii)____________ the overall perception of humor...\" The options are allows variations in, tends to accentuate, has little effect on. The next part says \"although it appears that it can (iii)____________ humor at specific points...\" The \"although\" introduces a contrast. So the main finding (before \"although\") is that the laughter does something to the overall perception, but it can do something else at specific points. If the first part is the main effect, and the second part is a different effect, maybe the main effect is that it doesn't have much effect overall, but can enhance at specific points. Wait, but the first part says \"most researchers have found that inclusion... (ii)____ overall perception.\" If the first blank is \"measurable,\" then the effect is there. If the first part says that including laughter has little effect on overall perception, but can enhance at specific points, that would make sense. But the colon after the first blank suggests that the first part is a summary. Let me re-read the entire sentence.\n\nThe power of laughter is (i)____: researchers found that including laughter (ii)____ overall perception, although it can (iii)____ humor at specific points and boost total comic appeal.\n\nWait, the \"although\" clause is saying that even though the overall effect is X, at specific points it does Y which boosts the total. So if the overall effect is \"has little effect on,\" then the specific points' enhancement would add up to a total boost. That makes sense. Because if overall it doesn't do much, but in specific moments it enhances, leading to a total increase. Alternatively, if the overall effect is \"tends to accentuate,\" then the specific points would need to do something else. But the sentence says \"although it appears that it can (iii)____ humor at specific points and thus boost the total...\" So the specific points' effect contributes to the total. If the overall effect is \"has little effect on,\" then the specific points' enhancement would explain why the total is boosted. But if the overall effect is \"tends to accentuate,\" then the specific points' effect would be in addition. Hmm. Let's think again.\n\nIf the inclusion of laughter tends to accentuate the overall perception, then even though it can enhance at specific points, which would further boost the total. But the structure is \"although it can (iii)____ humor at specific points and thus boost...\" The \"thus\" implies that the (iii) action leads to boosting the total. So if (iii) is \"enhance,\" then enhancing at specific points would boost the total. But if the overall effect is \"tends to accentuate,\" then the total is already being accentuated, so the specific points' enhancement would be part of that. But the \"although\" suggests a contrast. So maybe the main finding is that overall, the laughter doesn't have much effect, but at specific points, it enhances, leading to a total boost. That would fit with (ii) being \"has little effect on\" and (iii) being \"enhance.\" Then the first blank would be \"unclear\" if the effect is not clear, but the colon says that researchers have found something, so \"unclear\" might not fit. Wait, the first blank is about the power being (i). If the power is \"measurable,\" then the research findings (which are specific) support that. So if (i) is \"measurable,\" then (ii) could be \"has little effect on\" and (iii) \"enhance.\" But how does that make sense? If the overall effect is little, but specific points are enhanced, leading to a total boost. So the measurable effect is that overall, it doesn't do much, but in parts it does. That seems possible. Alternatively, if (ii) is \"tends to accentuate,\" then the overall effect is positive, and the specific points also enhance, which would make the total even higher. But the \"although\" would need a contrast. So \"although it can enhance at specific points\" would not contrast with \"tends to accentuate overall.\" The contrast would be between the overall effect and the specific effect. Wait, maybe the overall effect is that it doesn't do much, but at specific points, it does. So the main clause says the power is measurable, and the research shows that overall, it has little effect, but at specific points, it enhances. That way, the power is measurable (they can measure that it has little overall but some specific effect). So (i) measurable, (ii) has little effect on, (iii) enhance. Let me check the options again.\n\nBlank (i) options: cumulative, measurable, unclear. If the effect is measurable, then the colon explains that researchers found something. If it's unclear, the colon would say that researchers are unsure, but the sentence says \"most researchers have found...\" So \"unclear\" doesn't fit. So (i) is measurable. Then (ii) is \"has little effect on\" because the overall perception isn't much affected, but (iii) is \"enhance\" at specific points, which boosts the total. That makes sense. The colon introduces the explanation: the power is measurable because researchers found that overall it doesn't do much, but in specific parts it does. So the three answers would be measurable, has little effect on, enhance. Let me check the options again to confirm. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nmeasurable,has little effect on,enhance\nExplanation: The first blank is \"measurable\" because the colon introduces research findings, indicating the effect can be quantified. The second blank is \"has little effect on\" since the sentence contrasts the overall perception (which is not significantly impacted) with specific points. The third blank is \"enhance\" as laughter can increase humor at certain moments, leading to a total boost in comic appeal. The contrast between the overall effect and specific points is key here.",

The passage gives some clues about their lifestyle.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i): The sentence says that Maiacetus was a land animal but something about life in the sea. The example given is a fossil with a fetus positioned for head-first delivery, typical of land mammals, suggesting they gave birth onshore. But then there's a contrast with \"But it probably spent much of its time...\" So the first blank should indicate that they were suited for sea life even though they gave birth on land. The options are \"resistant,\" \"removed from,\" or \"adapted to.\" \"Adapted to\" makes sense here because it shows they had traits for the sea, even though they still gave birth on land. \"Resistant\" would mean they opposed sea life, which doesn't fit. \"Removed from\" would imply they didn't live in the sea, but the following sentences suggest they did spend time there.\n\nBlank (ii): The second part after \"But\" contrasts their birthing on land with spending time somewhere else. The clues are their big teeth for catching fish and flipper-like feet. If they caught fish, they must have been in the water. So the options here are \"in the water,\" \"fleeing predators,\" or \"protecting young.\" \"In the water\" fits because catching fish and having flipper feet suggest aquatic activity.\n\nBlank (iii): The flipper-like feet must have been something related to walking. The sentence says \"must have been _____ walking.\" The options are \"incompatible with,\" \"clumsy for,\" or \"strengthened by.\" Since flippers are more suited for swimming than walking, the feet would make walking difficult. \"Clumsy for\" implies they were awkward on land. \"Incompatible with\" might be too strong, suggesting they couldn't walk at all, but the fact that they gave birth onshore means they could walk, albeit clumsily. So \"clumsy for\" is better here.\n</think>\n\nadapted to, in the water, clumsy for\nExplanation: Blank(i) requires \"adapted to\" because the fossil evidence shows transitional whale ancestors developing sea-life traits while retaining land-birthing characteristics. Blank(ii) fits \"in the water\" as the teeth and flipper-like feet indicate aquatic hunting. Blank(iii) uses \"clumsy for\" since flipper-like appendages would hinder efficient terrestrial locomotion, aligning with the contrast between marine adaptation and limited land mobility.",

The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nThe sentence starts by saying that people thought Clark's old-mannered compliance was obsequiousness. Obsequiousness means being overly obedient or servile, right? So they thought he was just sucking up to people. But the colon after that indicates that an explanation follows. The part after the colon explains that his apparent something was hiding a fervent feeling towards the authority others had over him. And he expressed this feeling by sabotaging their projects discreetly.\n\nSo, the key here is that people misunderstood Clark. They thought his compliance was obsequiousness (which is negative), but actually, he had a hidden strong feeling against the authority. Because sabotaging projects is an act of resistance or dislike. So the first blank (i) should be a word meaning they misunderstood him. Looking at the options for Blank(i): misconstrued, condemned, respected. \"Misconstrued\" fits here because it means misinterpreted. Condemned would mean they judged him harshly, but the sentence is more about misunderstanding his behavior rather than judging it. Respected doesn't make sense here.\n\nBlank(ii) is about his apparent something that veiled his true feeling. The colon explains that his outward appearance was hiding his real emotion. Since others thought he was compliant (obsequious), his apparent behavior must be compliance. The options are cynicism, acquiescence, intractability. Acquiescence means agreement or compliance, so that fits. Because if he's showing acquiescence (compliance), but it's hiding his true feelings. Cynicism is a distrustful attitude, which doesn't fit the context of compliance. Intractability is being stubborn, which is the opposite of compliance.\n\nBlank(iii) is the fervent feeling he had towards the authority. Since he's sabotaging their projects, which is a negative action, his feeling must be negative. The options are veneration (respect), justification (making excuses), detestation (hatred). Detestation makes sense here. He detests the authority, so he secretly sabotages them. Veneration would mean he respects them, which contradicts the sabotage. Justification doesn't fit because the sentence is about his feelings, not justifying something.\n\nPutting it all together: People misconstrued his compliance as obsequiousness. His apparent acquiescence hid a detestation of authority, leading him to sabotage projects. So the answers are misconstrued, acquiescence, detestation.\n</think>\n\nmisconstrued,acquiescence,detestation\nExplanation: The colon indicates the latter clause explains why people's initial judgment of Clark was incorrect. They mistook his compliance (\"old-mannered compliance\") for obsequiousness (excessive eagerness to please), meaning they *misconstrued* (misinterpreted) him (Blank i). His apparent *acquiescence* (compliance) (Blank ii) actually concealed a strong *detestation* (hatred) (Blank iii) of authority, evidenced by his sabotage. \"Condemned\" and \"respected\" don't fit the misunderstanding context. \"Cynicism\" or \"intractability\" would contradict \"apparent compliance.\" \"Veneration\" or \"justification\" would oppose the sabotage motive.",

The sentence structure here is \"either the surge of mountain building (i)_____ the global cooling or vice versa.\" So, the two theories are opposites. If the first part is mountain building causing cooling, then vice versa would be cooling causing mountain building. So, \"caused\" makes sense here. The other options don't fit the cause-effect relationship needed here. Superseded means replaced, which doesn't fit. Halted would mean stopping, which also doesn't make sense in this context. So, Blank (i) is \"caused.\"\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The options are disparity between, feedback between, complexity of. The sentence says that mountain building cooled the earth due to the (ii)_____ mountains and climate. The example given is about glaciers being something that once established, they increase reflectivity, leading to lower temperatures and more ice. This sounds like a feedback loop. So, \"feedback between\" mountains and climate. The other options don't fit. Disparity would mean a difference, which isn't the point here. Complexity is too vague.

The colon here indicates that the blank is explained by the following statement. The process described is a cycle where the glacier's presence causes more glacier formation. That's a self-reinforcing cycle, so \"self-perpetuating\" fits. Unpredictable doesn't make sense here, and static would mean unchanging, which isn't the case since they are causing more ice to form.

Blank (ii) needs \"feedback between\" since the example describes a cyclical interaction where mountains and climate influence each other (glaciers lowering temperatures, which creates more glaciers). \"Disparity\" and \"complexity\" don't capture this mutual reinforcement. Blank (iii) requires \"self-perpetuating\" because the process described (ice increasing reflectivity, leading to more ice) sustains itself. \"Unpredictable\" and \"static\" contradict the described reinforcing mechanism.",

The structure is similar to the examples provided, so I can follow the same approach.\n\nFirst, I'll read the entire sentence carefully to understand the context. The passage is about poison dart frogs and the source of their toxins. The key points are that the frogs have deadly poisons called batrachotoxins, but the origin (or something related) of these toxins has been a mystery because the frogs don't produce them. Then, a study points to melyrid beetles as the source, and collected beetles have the toxins, implying the frogs eat them.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The sentence says the \"_____ of the toxins has remained an enigma.\" The options are effect, origin, purpose. Since the next part mentions the frog doesn't produce them, the mystery is about where the toxins come from. So \"origin\" makes sense here. Effect would be about what the toxins do, but the enigma is about their source. Purpose might relate to why they exist, but the context is about the source. So Blank (i) is \"origin.\"\n\nBlank (ii): The frog does not _____ them. The options are pressure, produce, suffer from. Since the frogs have the toxins but don't make them themselves, the correct word is \"produce.\" If they don't produce the toxins, that explains why their origin was a mystery. \"Suffer from\" doesn't fit here because the frogs aren't harmed by their own toxins. \"Pressure\" doesn't make sense in this context. So Blank (ii) is \"produce.\"\n\nBlank (iii): The beetles are suggested to be the source, so the frogs must consume them. The options are eaten, neutralized, poisoned. If the beetles contain the toxins and the frogs get the toxins from eating them, then \"eaten\" is the logical choice. \"Poisoned\" would mean the beetles are harmed by the toxins, but the frogs are the ones using the poison. \"Neutralized\" would imply the frogs counteract the toxins, which doesn't fit.

The options are competitive, tedious, exclusive. Since popularity usually leads to more competition, \"competitive\" makes sense. Tedious doesn't fit because popularity wouldn't make auctions more boring. Exclusive might imply limited access, but the context is about intensification, so competitive is better.\n\nNext, the second blank: \"Established collectors' interests are also becoming more (ii)_____.\" The options are fickle, wide-ranging, antiquarian. The next sentence says that collectors who focused on either 19th or 20th-century works now want something else. If they're expanding their focus, their interests are becoming more wide-ranging.

I need to figure out the correct words for each blank based on the context provided.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: \"In 1998, observations of a (i)____________ in the growth of atmospheric methane... suggested that many of the scenarios for global warming provided in a 1995 assessment may have been overly (ii)____________.\" Then the second part says, \"Celebration was, however, premature: subsequent research has established that the observed phenomena were likely caused by (iii)____________ declines in industrial and natural emissions.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the context. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. The observations in 1998 about its growth led people to think the 1995 scenarios were too something. But the celebration was premature, meaning the initial positive conclusion was wrong. The subsequent research found the cause was declines in emissions, which must be a temporary or short-term thing because if the declines were permanent, the celebration wouldn't be premature. So the initial observation probably showed a slowdown in methane growth, making people think the problem wasn't as bad as the 1995 scenarios predicted. But then it turned out the slowdown was due to temporary declines, not a long-term solution.\n\nFor Blank (i): The options are spike, slowdown, fluctuation. If the growth had a spike, that would mean methane increased rapidly, which might make scenarios seem too optimistic, but the next part says the scenarios were overly something. If the scenarios were from 1995, and the 1998 observation suggested they were overly \"gloomy\" (pessimistic), then the observation must have shown a reduction in methane growth. So a slowdown in growth would lead people to think the problem isn't as bad as previously thought. Fluctuation is a variation, but a slowdown specifically indicates a decrease in the rate of growth, which would directly lead to reassessing the scenarios. So Blank (i) is likely \"slowdown\".\n\nBlank (ii): The scenarios were in a 1995 assessment. If the 1998 observation suggested they were overly something, and the celebration was premature (meaning the initial conclusion was wrong), then the scenarios were probably too pessimistic. So the 1998 data made them seem too gloomy. The options are gloomy, detailed, ambitious. \"Overly gloomy\" would mean the scenarios predicted worse outcomes than what the 1998 data suggested. So Blank (ii) is \"gloomy\".\n\nBlank (iii): The subsequent research found the phenomena (the slowdown) were caused by declines in emissions. But since the celebration was premature, the declines must not be lasting. So the declines were temporary. The options are massive, persistent, temporary. If they were massive, that's a big decline, but if they were temporary, then the slowdown was just a short-term effect, hence the scenarios being overly gloomy was a mistake. So Blank (iii) is \"temporary\".\n\nPutting it all together: slowdown, gloomy, temporary. That matches the example given in Example 5, which has the same answer. So the final answer should be \"slowdown, gloomy, temporary\".\n</think>\n\nslowdown,gloomy,temporary",

The options for blank (i) are ambivalence, compliment, censure. Hmm. Since it's talking about both good and bad books being easy to review, the first blank should be the opposite of praise. So, for a very bad book, the reviewer would give censure, which means strong criticism. Compliment is similar to praise, so that's redundant. Ambivalence is having mixed feelings, but the sentence is contrasting good and bad, so the two extremes. So blank (i) is probably censure.\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"But what of books that contain a muddle of virtues and vices? Here the reviewer's task is more (ii)_____.\" The options are evident, demanding, manageable. Since the first part says that easy books are easy to review, the ones that are a mix would be harder. So the task would be more demanding. Evident doesn't fit here. Manageable would mean it's easier, but the contrast suggests it's harder. So (ii) is demanding.\n\nThird blank: \"the author's useful and thought-provoking observations need to be (iii)_____ the useless and tedious.\" The options are supplanted by, sifted from, overshadowed by. The reviewer has to separate the good from the bad. Sifted from makes sense here, as sifting is separating valuable things from the less desirable. Supplant means replace, which doesn't fit. Overshadowed by would mean the bad parts cover the good, which isn't what a reviewer would aim for. So (iii) is sifted from.\n\nPutting it all together: censure, demanding, sifted from. Let me check again. First blank: praise and censure (opposites) for good and bad books. Second, the task is more demanding when the book is mixed. Third, sifting the good from the bad. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\ncensure, demanding, sifted from",

Let me read through the question carefully.\n\nThe sentence starts by comparing unambiguous texts with ambiguous ones. The first blank is in the part about unambiguous texts allowing readers to do something quickly. The options for Blank(i) are misunderstand, comprehend, or complicate. Well, unambiguous means clear, so readers can understand them quickly. So \"comprehend\" makes sense here. \"Misunderstand\" would be the opposite, but since the text is unambiguous, misunderstanding isn't likely. \"Complicate\" doesn't fit because the text is clear, so readers wouldn't complicate it. So Blank(i) is probably \"comprehend.\"\n\nMoving to Blank(ii), the sentence says ambiguous texts have an attractive something of multiple interpretations. The options are stigma, blemish, allure. Stigma and blemish are negative, but the context here is positive because it's described as \"attractive.\" So \"allure\" fits here. Allure means attraction or appeal, which matches the positive connotation. So Blank(ii) is \"allure.\"\n\nNow Blank(iii) says all interpretations can be considered equally what. The options are valid, frank, inveterate. Frank means honest, which doesn't fit. Inveterate means habitual, which also doesn't make sense. Valid means logically sound or justifiable. Since the text is ambiguous, multiple interpretations can each be valid even if they're different. So Blank(iii) should be \"valid.\"\n\nLet me check the entire sentence again to make sure. Unambiguous texts let readers comprehend quickly. Ambiguous ones have allure because of multiple valid interpretations. Yes, that makes sense. The flow works, and the words fit the context.

So, the question is about how computers make it easy to search for information in texts, and how doing research in a targeted way can feel a certain way. The first blank is (i), and the options are disorienting, humbling, or empowering.\n\nHmm. The sentence says that using computers to search for info makes research feel (i)____. Since it's strategic and targeted, the feeling should be positive. \"Empowering\" makes sense here because having control over the search would make someone feel empowered. \"Disorienting\" is negative, and \"humbling\" doesn't fit the context of feeling in control.\n\nNext, blank (ii) is about instead of doing something to the organizing logic of the book. The options are disregarding, surrendering to, imitating. The sentence contrasts the targeted approach with the traditional way of following the book's structure. So instead of following the book's logic, you use your own questions. So the opposite would be \"surrendering to\" the book's logic. \"Disregarding\" would mean ignoring it, but the contrast is between following vs. not following. So \"surrendering to\" fits here.\n\nThen blank (iii) is about what you can do with your own questions.

It says that even (i)_____ species are likely to become endangered. The options for blank (i) are exotic, vulnerable, now common. Hmm. The sentence is suggesting that even species that aren't currently in danger might become endangered. So, if \"now common\" is an option, that makes sense. Because common species becoming endangered would show the severity. Exotic might refer to non-native, but maybe not. Vulnerable would mean they're already at risk, but the sentence says \"even\" which implies they weren't before. So probably \"now common\" for blank (i).\n\nNext, the second blank: If we want to avoid losing biodiversity, Golbe says we can't let nature take its course. So ongoing conservation management is (ii)_____. The options are ineffective, obligatory, promising. Since we can't just let nature handle it, management must be necessary. So \"obligatory\" fits here. Ineffective would contradict the need, and promising might not fit as well. So obligatory for blank (ii).\n\nThird blank: the responsibilities that come with the role cannot be (iii)_____. The options are jettisoned, assumed, contrived. The sentence says we've become nature, so we can't avoid the responsibilities. \"Jettisoned\" means discarded, which makes sense. Assumed would be the opposite, and contrived doesn't fit.

The options are atypical, unavoidable, insurmountable. \"Intrinsic part\" suggests it's something that can't be avoided, so unavoidable fits here. Atypical would mean it's not typical, which contradicts \"intrinsic part.\" Insurmountable means can't be overcome, but the sentence is about the struggle being a part of life, not whether it's possible to overcome.\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"if one does not (ii)_____, but steadfastly meets unexpected and often unjust hardships...\" The structure here is contrasting not doing something with steadfastly meeting hardships. The options are preserve, improvise, shy away. The contrast is between avoiding the hardships and facing them. So \"shy away\" makes sense here. If you don't shy away, you face them. Preserve doesn't fit the context, and improvise is more about adapting, which isn't directly the opposite of meeting hardships.\n\nThird blank: \"one masters all obstacles and at the end (iii)_____.\" The result of overcoming obstacles would logically be a positive outcome.

Evades achievements is the opposite of what's intended. So the fairy tale message is that if you face hardships, you overcome them and come out victorious.\n\nPutting it all together: unavoidable, shy away, emerges victorious. Let me double-check each blank to make sure. First blank: unavoidable as an intrinsic part. Second: not shy away, so face them. Third: victorious. Yeah, that makes sense.

The sentence is about jewelry-grade diamonds and the conclusions they prove about their purchasers. The blanks are (i), (ii), and (iii).\n\nFirst, let's read the sentence carefully. The writer is saying that because diamonds are both (i) and (ii), they lead to one of two conclusions: either the buyers have so much money they can spend on goods that (iii), or they're trying to appear wealthy even if they go into debt.\n\nStarting with Blank (i) and (ii). The diamonds are jewelry-grade, so they must have certain characteristics. The two blanks are connected by \"both...and,\" so the adjectives should be related but distinct. The conclusion is that either the purchasers have a lot of money to spend on such goods, or they're trying to show off wealth. \n\nLooking at Blank (i) options: flawless, fungible, expensive. Jewelry diamonds are often considered flawless, but fungible means interchangeable, which might not fit. Expensive is a possibility. For Blank (ii): durable, useless, irreplaceable. Diamonds are known for being durable. But if they are expensive and durable, how does that lead to the conclusions? Let's think. If they are expensive and durable, maybe they are seen as investments (appreciate in value), so people with money buy them. Alternatively, if they are expensive and useless, then buying them would be for showing off. Wait, the second conclusion is that people are willing to go into debt to make others think they're wealthy. So if the diamonds are expensive and serve no practical purpose (useless), then buying them would be a status symbol. So maybe (i) is expensive and (ii) is useless. Then Blank (iii) would be \"serve no practical purpose,\" which matches the second part. But the first conclusion is that purchasers have so much money they can spend on goods that (iii). If the goods serve no purpose, then having money to spend on such things shows they have excess. Alternatively, if the goods may appreciate, then that's a reason to buy them. But the two conclusions are opposites: either they have money to spend on something that's a good investment, or they're faking wealth by buying something useless. Wait, the structure is \"prove one of two conclusions; their purchasers have so much money they can spend it on goods that (iii)_____, or their purchasers are so committed to making others think they have such wealth that they are willing to go into debt to do so.\" So the first conclusion is that the purchasers are so rich they can afford to buy something that (iii). The second is that they're not rich but want to appear so. So for the first conclusion, the goods must be something that's a good use of money (maybe appreciating) or something that's a frivolous expense. If the diamonds are expensive and useless, then the first conclusion is that they can afford to spend on useless things, and the second is that they go into debt to buy them to appear rich. That makes sense. So Blank (iii) would be \"serve no practical purpose.\" Let's check the options. Blank (iii) options: may appreciate in value; reflect the buyers' connoisseurship; serve no practical purpose. So if (iii) is \"serve no practical purpose,\" then the first conclusion is that they have money to spend on things that are useless, and the second is they go into debt to buy them to show off. That fits. So then Blanks (i) and (ii) would be expensive and useless. Let's check the options again. Blank (i) options: expensive. Blank (ii) options: useless. Yes. So the answer would be expensive, useless, serve no practical purpose. Let me double-check. If diamonds are expensive and useless, then buying them either shows you have money to burn (so much that you can spend on useless things) or you're faking wealth by going into debt. That makes sense. The other options: if (i) was flawless and (ii) durable, then (iii) might be \"may appreciate,\" but that doesn't tie into the conclusions as directly. Alternatively, fungible (interchangeable) doesn't seem right. So I think the correct answer is expensive, useless, serve no practical purpose.\n</think>\n\nexpensive, useless, serve no practical purpose",

The first blank says that watermills were more (i)_____ than windmills. The options are problematic, profitable, or versatile.\n\nHmm. The next sentence starts with \"It is true that windmills could be built virtually anywhere, whereas watermills (ii)_____.\" So, the contrast here is that windmills are more flexible in location, but watermills have some limitation. So for blank (ii), the options are: were suitable only for certain locations; inspired new tech; required upkeep. Since the first part says windmills can be built anywhere, the contrast would be that watermills needed specific locations. So blank (ii) is probably \"were suitable only for certain locations.\"\n\nBut then the third part says \"However, watermills' greater capacity and reliability provided a better (iii)_____ the money...\" The \"however\" indicates that despite the location limitation, their capacity and reliability made up for it. So the third blank is about the benefit of investing in them. The options are source of, adjunct to, return on. \"Return on investment\" is a common phrase, so \"return on\" makes sense here. So (iii) is return on.\n\nNow going back to blank (i). The first sentence is comparing watermills and windmills. The rest of the paragraph explains that even though windmills are more versatile in location, watermills are better in capacity and reliability, leading to a better return on money. So the first blank should be a positive attribute. The options are problematic (negative), profitable (positive), versatile (positive). But the contrast is that windmills are more versatile in location, but watermills are more something else. Wait, but the first blank is saying watermills were more (i) than windmills. But the next sentence says windmills could be built anywhere, which is a point in their favor. However, the \"however\" part says watermills' capacity and reliability made up for the cost. So maybe the first blank is about profitability. Because even though windmills are more versatile (can be built anywhere), watermills are more profitable because they have higher capacity and reliability, giving a better return on investment. So blank (i) is profitable. That makes sense. So the answer would be profitable, were suitable only for certain locations, return on.\n</think>\n\nprofitable, were suitable only for certain locations, return on",

So, the question is about Japan's first university compared to Chinese counterparts during the same era. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first blank (i) says Japan's first university was more [blank] than Chinese ones. The options are prestigious, egalitarian, or profitable. The sentence continues by explaining that the Chinese Tang system was highly [blank (ii)], with options aristocratic, reputable, or unsystematic. Then, later, it mentions that as Japanese court offices became hereditary, the examination system (which allowed students from various classes to enter universities) [blank (iii)] with options like became widely utilized, advantaged the proletariat, or atrophied into insignificance.\n\nStarting with the first part: Japan's university was more [something] than Chinese ones. The reason given is that the Tang system was highly [something]. The word \"since\" here indicates a cause. So, if the Chinese system was highly aristocratic, then maybe the Japanese one was more egalitarian. Because if the Chinese system favored the aristocracy, then a more egalitarian system would contrast with that. So blank (i) might be \"egalitarian\" and blank (ii) \"aristocratic.\"\n\nThen, the next part: as Japanese offices became hereditary, the examination system (which allowed a wide range of classes) did something. If the offices became hereditary, that means positions were based on family rather than merit. So the examination system, which was based on merit and open to different classes, would decline. So blank (iii) would be \"atrophied into insignificance.\" Because if the system is no longer used because positions are hereditary, then the exams lose their importance.\n\nPutting it all together: Japan's first university was more egalitarian (since Chinese were aristocratic), but when Japanese offices became hereditary, the exam system (which was egalitarian) atrophied. That makes sense. Let me check the options again to confirm.\n\nBlank (i): egalitarian. Yes, because if the Chinese were aristocratic, then egalitarian is the opposite. Blank (ii): aristocratic. That fits. Blank (iii): atrophied into insignificance. Yes, because hereditary positions would make the exams less important. So the answer should be egalitarian, aristocratic, atrophied into insignificance.\n</think>\n\negalitarian, aristocratic, atrophied into insignificance",

The first blank says the narrative is (i)_____, and the reason given is that even though there's nothing (ii)_____ the account, large parts rely on (iii)_____. \n\nStarting with the first blank options: diffuse, reasonable, questionable. The sentence structure here is \"because though there is nothing [blank ii], largely parts rely on [blank iii].\" The word \"because\" indicates that the reason explains why the narrative is [blank i].\n\nSo, if the account isn't [blank ii], but parts are based on [blank iii], then the narrative's quality is affected. Let's look at blank ii options: psychologically penetrating in, inherently implausible about, fully documented in. If the account isn't \"fully documented,\" then parts relying on something else (like conjecture) would make the narrative questionable. Alternatively, if there's nothing \"inherently implausible,\" but parts are based on conjecture, maybe the narrative is still questionable. Hmm.\n\nWait, the structure is \"though there is nothing [blank ii] the account, largely parts rely on [blank iii].\" The \"though\" sets up a contrast. So even though the account isn't [blank ii], parts are based on [blank iii], which might be a weakness. So if blank ii is \"fully documented in,\" then even though it's not fully documented, parts rely on conjecture. That would make the narrative questionable. Alternatively, if blank ii is \"inherently implausible about,\" then even though it's not implausible, parts are conjecture. But that might not make the narrative questionable. Maybe the first case is better.\n\nSo blank i: if the account isn't fully documented (so there's a lack of evidence), but parts are conjecture, then the narrative is questionable. So blank i would be \"questionable.\" Then blank iii would be \"conjecture.\" Let's check the options. Blank iii options are plagiarism, conjecture, pretense. Conjecture fits here as relying on guesswork. So putting it together: The narrative is questionable because, though there's nothing fully documented in the account, parts rely on conjecture. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if blank ii was \"inherently implausible,\" then even though the account isn't implausible, parts are conjecture. But that might not directly lead to the narrative being questionable. Because if it's not implausible, but uses conjecture, maybe it's still questionable. But \"inherently implausible\" is about being unbelievable, whereas \"fully documented\" is about evidence. Since the problem is that parts rely on conjecture (lack of evidence), the contrast would be that even though there's nothing \"fully documented\" (wait, that's the opposite). Wait, the phrase is \"though there is nothing [blank ii] the account.\" If blank ii is \"fully documented in,\" then the sentence would read \"though there is nothing fully documented in the account,\" which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me parse the sentence again.\n\nOriginal sentence: \"The historian's narrative of the dynasty's decline is (i)_____, because though there is nothing (ii)_____ the account, largely parts of it rely on (iii)_____.\"\n\nSo the structure is: The narrative is [i] because, though there's nothing [ii] the account, parts rely on [iii].\n\nSo \"though there is nothing [ii] the account\" is a positive thing, but \"parts rely on [iii]\" is a negative. So the contrast is between a positive aspect (nothing [ii]) and a negative (relying on [iii]). Therefore, [ii] should be a positive attribute, and [iii] a negative. So if [ii] is \"fully documented in,\" that's a positive. Then the account is not fully documented (since \"nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account lacks full documentation). Wait, no. The phrase is \"there is nothing [ii] the account.\" So if [ii] is \"fully documented in,\" then \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account isn't documented. But that's a negative. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the phrase \"there is nothing [ii] the account\" – the structure is \"nothing [adjective phrase] the account.\" For example, \"nothing wrong with the account.\" So here, the options for blank ii are phrases like \"psychologically penetrating in,\" \"inherently implausible about,\" \"fully documented in.\" So \"there is nothing inherently implausible about the account\" would mean the account is plausible. Then, the contrast is that even though the account is plausible (nothing implausible), parts rely on conjecture. So the narrative is questionable because even though it's plausible, parts are based on conjecture. That makes sense. Alternatively, if [ii] is \"fully documented in,\" then \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account lacks full documentation, which is a negative. Then the narrative is questionable because parts rely on conjecture. But that would mean the account isn't documented, so relying on conjecture makes it questionable. But the structure is \"though there is nothing [ii] the account,\" which is a positive. So \"though there is nothing [negative] the account,\" but the options for [ii] are \"inherently implausible about\" (negative), \"fully documented in\" (positive?), \"psychologically penetrating in\" (positive). Wait, \"there is nothing [positive] the account\" would be a negative. For example, \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account isn't documented. But \"there is nothing inherently implausible about the account\" would mean the account is plausible. So the structure is: the narrative is [i] because, though [positive aspect], [negative aspect]. So if [ii] is \"inherently implausible about,\" then the positive is that the account is plausible, but parts rely on conjecture, making the narrative questionable. Alternatively, if [ii] is \"fully documented in,\" then the negative is that the account isn't documented, and parts rely on conjecture, which would also make the narrative questionable. But which one fits better?\n\nThe key is that \"though there is nothing [ii] the account\" – the \"nothing\" negates [ii]. So if [ii] is a negative term, then \"nothing [negative]\" becomes a positive. For example, \"nothing inherently implausible\" (so it's plausible). If [ii] is a positive term, then \"nothing [positive]\" becomes a negative. For example, \"nothing fully documented\" (so it's not documented). So the sentence is saying that even though there's a positive (the account is plausible or well-documented), there's a negative (relying on conjecture). Wait, but if [ii] is \"fully documented in,\" then \"nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account isn't documented, which is a negative. Then the sentence would be: the narrative is questionable because, though there's nothing fully documented (i.e., it's not documented), parts rely on conjecture. That makes sense. But the structure is \"though there is nothing [ii] the account,\" which is supposed to be a positive point. So maybe [ii] should be a negative term that's negated by \"nothing,\" making it a positive. For example, \"nothing inherently implausible\" (so it's plausible), but parts rely on conjecture. So the narrative is questionable because even though it's plausible (nothing implausible), it's based on conjecture. That seems possible. Alternatively, if [ii] is \"fully documented,\" then \"nothing fully documented\" would mean it's not documented, which is a negative, and the parts rely on conjecture, making the narrative questionable. But in that case, the \"though\" is contrasting a negative (not documented) with another negative (relying on conjecture), which doesn't make sense. The \"though\" should contrast a positive with a negative. So the correct structure is: the narrative is questionable because, even though there's a positive (nothing implausible), there's a negative (relying on conjecture). Therefore, [ii] should be \"inherently implausible about,\" making the first part a positive (it's plausible), but the reliance on conjecture makes it questionable. Alternatively, if [ii] is \"fully documented in,\" then the first part is a negative (not documented), leading to the same conclusion. But which is more logical?\n\nIf the account is plausible (nothing implausible), but relies on conjecture, that's a contradiction. Because if it's plausible, but based on conjecture, then it's questionable. Alternatively, if the account isn't documented (nothing fully documented), and relies on conjecture, that's a reason to be questionable. Both could work. But let's look at the options for blank iii. The options are conjecture, plagiarism, pretense. Conjecture is speculation, which is a lack of evidence. Plagiarism is stealing others' work, which isn't directly related. Pretense is faking, which might not fit. So if the historian uses conjecture, that's a problem. So the narrative is questionable because even though there's nothing implausible, it's based on conjecture. Or, even though there's nothing fully documented (so it's not well-supported), it's based on conjecture. Which makes more sense? If the account isn't fully documented, then relying on conjecture would make it questionable. But the structure is \"though there is nothing [ii] the account,\" which is a positive. So if [ii] is \"inherently implausible about,\" then \"nothing inherently implausible\" means it's plausible, but parts are conjecture. So the narrative is questionable because even though it's plausible, parts are conjecture. That makes sense. Alternatively, if [ii] is \"fully documented in,\" then \"nothing fully documented\" means it's not documented, which is a negative, but the \"though\" is supposed to introduce a positive. So the correct answer is probably \"inherently implausible about\" for [ii], making the first part a positive (it's plausible), but the reliance on conjecture makes the narrative questionable. Therefore, blank i is \"questionable,\" blank ii is \"inherently implausible about,\" and blank iii is \"conjecture.\" Let me check again. The narrative is questionable because, though there's nothing inherently implausible about the account (so it's plausible), large parts rely on conjecture (which is unproven). That makes sense. So the answer would be questionable, inherently implausible about, conjecture. Wait, but the options for blank i are \"diffuse; reasonable; questionable.\" So if the narrative is questionable, that fits. Yes. So the final answer should be questionable, inherently implausible about, conjecture. Let me check the options again to confirm. Blank ii options: \"inherently implausible about\" is an option. Yes. Blank iii: conjecture is an option. So the answer is (i) questionable, (ii) inherently implausible about, (iii) conjecture.\n</think>\n\nquestionable, inherently implausible about, conjecture",

The second and third blanks are in the next sentence, where the Galaxy Zoo team was inspired because of something related to the volunteers' qualities.\n\nStarting with the first blank. The sentence says \"Zealous volunteers (i)_____ the project's organizers by classifying an entire catalog of galaxies years ahead of schedule.\" The key words here are \"zealous\" (which means enthusiastic) and \"years ahead of schedule.\" So the volunteers did something that affected the organizers. The options are \"beguiled,\" \"forestalled,\" \"astonished.\" \n\nBeguiled means to charm or enchant, sometimes deceptively. Forestalled means prevented or delayed. Astonished means surprised. Since the volunteers completed the work early, the organizers would be surprised. So \"astonished\" makes sense here. They didn't prevent the organizers, they surprised them by finishing early. So blank (i) is \"astonished.\"\n\nNext, the second and third blanks: \"(ii)_____ by the (iii)_____ of the volunteers, Galaxy Zoo team was inspired...\" The team was inspired, so the second blank should be a positive word. The options for (ii) are Baffled, Buoyed, Embarrassed. Buoyed means uplifted or encouraged, which is positive. Baffled is confused, and embarrassed is negative. So \"Buoyed\" fits here. \n\nNow, the third blank: the volunteers' (iii)_____. The options are insouciance (casualness), stoicism (endurance without complaint), alacrity (eagerness or speed). Since the volunteers were zealous and finished early, their alacrity (eagerness) would be the reason the team was buoyed. Alacrity matches the enthusiasm and quick work. So (iii) is \"alacrity.\"\n\nPutting it all together: astonished, buoyed, alacrity. Let me check again. The volunteers astonished the organizers by finishing early. The team was buoyed (encouraged) by the volunteers' alacrity (eagerness), leading them to pursue new research. That makes sense. The other options don't fit as well. For example, \"insouciance\" would be casualness, which contradicts \"zealous.\" Stoicism is about enduring, but the context is about speed and enthusiasm.

So, the author is arguing that calling him a foreigner is incorrect because the US didn't exist yet when he was born. \n\nThen the sentence continues: \"It is true that Hamilton came to believe that he was a (i)_____ the United States, but his (ii)_____ was stemmed not from his (iii)_____ but from his confrontation with American democracy...\" \n\nSo, the first blank (i) is about how Hamilton saw himself in relation to the US. The options are symbol of, stranger in, citizen of. The first part of the sentence says that labeling him a foreigner is anachronistic, so the author is against that label. But the sentence starts with \"It is true that Hamilton came to believe...\" So even though the author says labeling him a foreigner is wrong, Hamilton himself might have felt like a stranger. Let's hold that thought.\n\nThe second blank (ii) is his something that was stemmed not from his (iii) but from his confrontation with American democracy.

Let me read through the question carefully.\n\nThe sentence starts by talking about Friedlander, a photographer, and how he (i)_____ places that most people consider ugly. The first part says that just because he does this doesn't mean he's trying to prove they're beautiful. Then it contrasts with \"instead,\" indicating that his work has a different purpose. The second part says he can't ignore the built American landscape and is obligated to (ii)_____ what we pass through daily, regardless of (iii)_____.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The options are \"tends to avoid,\" \"is harshly critical of,\" and \"is interested in.\" The first part of the sentence is saying that even though he does something with ugly places, he's not trying to make them look beautiful. If he's not avoiding them, then maybe he's photographing them. So \"is interested in\" makes sense here. Because if he's interested in photographing ugly places, people might think he's trying to show their beauty, but the sentence says that's not the case. So Blank (i) is probably \"is interested in.\"\n\nMoving to Blank (ii): The options are \"document,\" \"emulate,\" and \"discredit.\" The sentence says he can't ignore the landscape and is obligated to do something with what we pass through daily. Since he's a photographer, the natural choice would be \"document.\" Photographers document things. Emulate would mean copying, which doesn't fit. Discredit would be negative, but the sentence isn't about disproving something. So Blank (ii) is likely \"document.\"\n\nNow Blank (iii): Options are \"authenticity,\" \"truthfulness,\" and \"aesthetics.\" The phrase is \"regardless of (iii)_____.\" The idea here is that he's documenting these places without considering their aesthetic value. Since the places are considered ugly, aesthetics (how beautiful they are) would be the factor he's ignoring. So \"aesthetics\" fits here. The other options, authenticity and truthfulness, don't relate as directly to beauty or ugliness.\n\nPutting it all together: Friedlander is interested in ugly places, doesn't aim to make them beautiful, but feels obligated to document them regardless of their aesthetics. That makes sense. Let me check each blank again to make sure there's no better fit. For Blank (i), \"is interested in\" works because he's photographing them.

Let me read through the question carefully.\n\nThe first part says that Trudeau and Shephard looked at 17 studies from 2008 and concluded that reserving up to an hour a day for something in school curricula does not something academic achievement. Then, they noted that more exercise often something school performance, even though it takes time away from core subjects. \n\nStarting with the first blank. The options are physical activity, leisure time, open study. The context is about reserving time in school curricula. Since the conclusion is about exercise affecting academic achievement, the first blank is likely related to exercise. So \"physical activity\" makes sense here. Leisure time is too vague, and open study doesn't fit because the next part talks about exercise. So Blank(i) is probably physical activity.\n\nMoving to the second blank. The options are contribute to, detract from, correlate with. The sentence says that reserving time for physical activity does not [blank] academic achievement. The conclusion is that it doesn't harm academic achievement. So \"detract from\" would mean it doesn't reduce or harm it. If they said it doesn't contribute to, that would mean it doesn't help, but the next part says more exercise often improves performance, so the first conclusion is that it doesn't hurt. So Blank(ii) should be detract from.\n\nThird blank: the options are diminished, augmented, counteracted. The sentence says that more exercise often [blank] school performance despite taking time away. Since despite implies a positive effect even though time is lost, the word should be positive. \"Augmented\" means improved, so that fits. If it diminished, that would contradict the \"despite\" part. Counteracted doesn't fit here. So Blank(iii) is augmented.\n\nPutting it all together: physical activity, detract from, augmented. Let me check again. The first blank is definitely physical activity. The second: the conclusion is that reserving time for exercise doesn't harm academic performance. So \"does not detract from\" makes sense. Then, more exercise \"augmented\" performance. Yes, that all fits. The answer should be physical activity, detract from, augmented.\n</think>\n\nphysical activity, detract from, augmented",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first blank is about what the use of these metaphors contributes to the argumentative process. The options are analysis, proliferation, or breakdown. The sentence says that using battle/sports metaphors might lead to adversarial conceptions. If people start seeing arguments as battles or sports, that could lead to more aggression. So, maybe the process breaks down because of that aggression. So, breakdown might be the first blank. Analysis doesn't fit here because the context is negative. Proliferation would mean an increase, but the process itself isn't increasing; it's being negatively affected. So breakdown makes sense.\n\nNext, the second blank: such metaphors may ___ adversarial conceptions. The options are distort, retard, promote. If the metaphors are contributing to a negative outcome (breakdown), then they probably encourage or promote adversarial ideas. Promote fits here. Distort would mean changing the conception, but the sentence is more about causing those conceptions to exist. Retard would mean slowing them down, which contradicts the negative effect. So promote is likely the answer here.\n\nThird blank: leading people to behave aggressively, thereby ___ a process that should lead to resolution. The options are presaging, simulating, undermining. If they're behaving aggressively, that would harm the process. Undermining means weakening or subverting, which fits. Presaging is predicting, which doesn't make sense. Simulating would be imitating, but the process is supposed to lead to resolution, so undermining it by aggression makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together: breakdown (of the process), promote (adversarial ideas), undermining (the process). Let me check again. The metaphors contribute to the breakdown. They promote adversarial conceptions, leading to aggression, which undermines the resolution process. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nbreakdown, promote, undermining",

The options are \"make public,\" \"debunked,\" or \"refused to consider.\" \n\nHmm. The phrase \"laid down a challenge\" suggests that they released or published the guidelines. \"Make public\" makes sense here. If they \"debunked\" the guidelines, that would mean they disproved them, which doesn't fit. \"Refused to consider\" also doesn't make sense because the guidelines are being presented as a challenge. So Blank(i) is probably \"make public.\"\n\nNext, the second blank: \"The 'or else' included a long list of (ii)_____ that (iii)_____ the developed world...\" The options for (ii) are \"intangibles,\" \"misconceptions,\" or \"maladies.\" The \"or else\" refers to negative consequences, so they're listing negative things. \"Maladies\" means diseases or illnesses, which fits with the examples given like heart disease and osteoporosis. \"Intangibles\" are things you can't touch, which doesn't fit here. \"Misconceptions\" are wrong beliefs, but the list is of actual diseases, not wrong ideas. So Blank(ii) is likely \"maladies.\"\n\nNow the third blank: \"...that (iii)_____ the developed world.\" The options are \"assuage,\" \"plague,\" or \"ignore.\" The diseases mentioned (heart disease, diabetes) are problems affecting the developed world. \"Plague\" here would mean to afflict or trouble, which makes sense. \"Assuage\" means to relieve, which is the opposite. \"Ignore\" doesn't fit because the diseases aren't ignoring the world. So Blank(iii) should be \"plague.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The Agriculture Department made public the guidelines, warning of maladies that plague the developed world. That makes sense.

The next sentences explain more. The second sentence mentions that most are truly (ii)____________ its growth and opportunities. The options here are \"unaware of,\" \"anxious about,\" and \"excited by.\" Then the third part says they also sense that trying to hold it back makes them look foolish. But then, (iii)____________, they find the Internet's culture and border contempt subversive and terrifying. The options for Blank (iii) are \"Moreover,\" \"At the same time,\" and \"Consequently.\"\n\nSo, the structure here seems to present two contrasting views. On one hand, governments recognize the growth and opportunities (so maybe excited by?), but on the other hand, they find aspects of it terrifying. That suggests a mixed feeling, which would be ambivalence. So Blank (i) is likely \"ambivalent about.\" \n\nFor Blank (ii), if they are ambivalent, they have both positive and negative feelings. The first part after Blank (i) says \"most are truly (ii)____________ its phenomenal growth and opportunities.\" If they are excited by the growth, that's a positive, which would contrast with the later negative feeling. So \"excited by\" makes sense here. Then, the third blank is a transition. The sentence after the transition talks about their negative feelings. The transition word needs to show contrast. \"At the same time\" is a contrast transition, whereas \"Moreover\" adds similar points, and \"Consequently\" shows effect. So \"At the same time\" fits here. \n\nPutting it all together: Governments are ambivalent (mixed feelings). They are excited by the growth (positive), but at the same time, they find the libertarian aspects terrifying (negative). That makes sense. Let me check the options again.

But then sociologists have shown that the relationship is something else.\n\nFor blank (i), the options are \"nebulous at best,\" \"not as arbitrary,\" and \"less one-sided.\" The original view was that findings are fixed and theories are built on them, implying a one-sided relationship where data is the foundation. But the sociologists are challenging that, so the relationship must be more mutual or reciprocal. \"Less one-sided\" makes sense here because it suggests it's not just theories depending on data but a two-way interaction.\n\nMoving to blank (ii), the options are \"hypothetical,\" \"disputable,\" and \"consequential.\" The sentence says empirical data may be as [blank] as theories. Since theories are often considered changeable or debatable, the data might be similarly questionable. \"Disputable\" fits here because it means data can be challenged, just like theories. \"Hypothetical\" doesn't fit because data is supposed to be empirical, not hypothetical. \"Consequential\" is about importance, which doesn't contrast well with the idea that data is fixed.\n\nFor blank (iii), the options are \"variance,\" \"likelihood,\" and \"credibility.\" The sentence talks about a theory with strong prior confirmation reducing the [blank] of a conflicting new finding. If a well-supported theory exists, a conflicting finding might be seen as less credible. So \"credibility\" makes sense here. \"Variance\" refers to variability, and \"likelihood\" is about probability, which doesn't fit as well.

Since consumer ads have evolved, they probably value innovation or new ideas. The options are caution, tradition, originality. Originality makes sense here because it's about coming up with new things, which would lead to change. Caution would make them not change much, and tradition is the opposite of change. So blank (i) is originality.\n\nBlank (ii) is what political advertisers prize. Since their ads haven't changed much, they might value sticking to what works or conforming to established methods. The options are earnestness, conformity, persuasion. Conformity fits because it's about following the same patterns, leading to less change. Persuasion is important in ads, but the key here is the contrast with consumer ads' evolution.

Hmm. Common sense here is suggesting that people vary in some trait. The next part talks about the claim that these differences are either illusory, growing, or relevant. Then the third blank says that this claim either mimics, explains, or contradicts our everyday observations and moral evaluations.\n\nSo, the main idea seems to be that there's a common-sense belief that people differ in a certain trait, but a claim is being made that those differences aren't real (illusory) or something else. The third part would then say whether that claim aligns with or goes against our observations.\n\nStarting with blank (i): The options are altruistic, adaptable, disciplined. The sentence later mentions that the claim is that everyone acts to further their own interests. So if the claim is that everyone is self-interested, then the initial statement must be about people being more altruistic (since altruism is the opposite of self-interest). So blank (i) is probably \"altruistic.\"\n\nThen blank (ii): The claim is that these differences (in altruism) are either illusory, growing, or relevant. If the claim is that deep down everyone acts in self-interest, then the differences in altruism would be considered not real, so \"illusory\" makes sense here. So blank (ii) is \"illusory.\"\n\nNow blank (iii): The claim that differences are illusory and everyone is self-interested either mimics, explains, or contradicts our observations. Since common sense says some are more altruistic, but the claim says it's not true, then the claim would contradict everyday observations. So blank (iii) should be \"contradicts.\"\n\nPutting it all together: altruistic, illusory, contradicts. Let me check again. If the claim is that differences in altruism are illusory (they don't really exist), then that claim would go against (contradict) our everyday experiences where we do observe people acting altruistically. Yes, that makes sense. The other options for blank (iii) don't fit. \"Explains\" would mean the claim supports the observations, but here it's the opposite. \"Mimics\" doesn't fit either.

Then, the next part mentions policies aimed at limiting population growth have been (i)_____. The word \"nevertheless\" indicates a contrast here. So even though these policies have been implemented (or whatever the first blank is), the country's vast size and isolation mean that human populations in areas with large carnivores (ii)_____.

The sentence structure here is that policies aimed at limiting population growth have been (i)____; nevertheless, the country's size and isolation mean that human populations in those areas (ii)____. The \"nevertheless\" suggests that despite the policies being put in place (if implemented), the effect isn't as expected. So if the policies were implemented, but due to the country's size and isolation, human populations in those areas might still be growing. So the first blank is likely \"implemented\". Because if the policies are implemented, but the result is still problematic, that's a contrast. If the policies were deemphasized, then the problem would be worse, but the \"nevertheless\" implies that even with the policies, there's still an issue. So I think Blank(i) is \"implemented\".\n\nMoving to Blank(ii). The options are could start to decline, can grow unchecked, have stabilized. Since the first part says that policies to limit growth have been implemented, but the country's vastness and isolation mean that in areas where carnivores are present, human populations (ii)____. The idea here is that even with policies, in remote areas, enforcement might be difficult, so human populations can continue to grow without control. So \"can grow unchecked\" makes sense. If the policies are in place but in some areas, they can't control the growth, so human populations there can grow unchecked. That would explain the continued threat to the carnivores. So Blank(ii) is \"can grow unchecked\".\n\nThen Blank(iii): the human pressure has (iii)_____ the South China tiger. The options are celebrated, doomed, bypassed. Since the main threat is human pressure, the result would be negative. \"Doomed\" fits here, meaning that the tiger's fate is sealed towards extinction. \"Bypassed\" doesn't make sense because the pressure affects them, not avoids them. \"Celebrated\" is obviously wrong.

Let me start by reading the entire sentence carefully to understand the context.\n\nThe first part says, \"The usual (i)_____ spending public monies on scientific projects is that such projects have the potential to make our lives healthier, safer, and more productive.\" So, the first blank is about the reason or justification for spending public money on science. The options are \"argument against,\" \"rationale for,\" or \"precedent for.\" The sentence is explaining why they spend the money, so it's a positive reason. \"Rationale for\" makes sense here because it means the underlying reason. \"Argument against\" would be negative, which doesn't fit. \"Precedent for\" is about previous examples, but the sentence is talking about the justification, not past instances. So Blank(i) is probably \"rationale for.\"\n\nNext, the second blank: \"However, the fact that science – even 'pure' science – can strengthen democracy and promote public participation in the political process is hardly ever (ii)_____.\" The word \"however\" indicates a contrast. The first part was about the usual reason (health, safety, productivity), but this part is saying that another benefit (democracy) is not often something. The options are \"denied,\" \"mentioned,\" or \"gainsaid.\" \"Gainsaid\" means contradicted or denied. If the usual reason is given, but this other benefit is not often talked about, then \"mentioned\" fits here. If it were \"denied\" or \"gainsaid,\" that would mean people are saying it's not true, but the sentence structure suggests it's just not brought up. So Blank(ii) is \"mentioned.\"\n\nThird blank: \"It should be Scientific literacy (iii)_____ democracy, and this is an important ancillary benefit of the promotion of science.\" The sentence is saying that scientific literacy does something positive to democracy. The options are \"stifles,\" \"energizes,\" or \"disregards.\" Since the context is about promoting democracy and participation, \"energizes\" makes sense. \"Stifles\" would be negative, opposite of what's intended. \"Disregards\" doesn't fit because it's about ignoring, which isn't related. So Blank(iii) should be \"energizes.\"\n\nPutting it all together: rationale for, mentioned, energizes. Let me check again. The first blank is the reason for spending money, which is the rationale. The second is that the democracy aspect is not often mentioned. The third is that literacy energizes democracy. Yeah, that makes sense. The answer should be \"rationale for, mentioned, energizes.\"\n</think>\n\nrationale for, mentioned, energizes",

The methods, especially regarding the researcher, were meant to do something to those \"something\" subjectivity. The unbridled expression of that subjectivity was thought to do something else to research.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence structure. The main idea is that methods were developed to remove distortions. The methods, particularly concerning the researcher, were considered to (i)_____ those (ii)_____ subjectivity. The unbridled (uncontrolled) expression of this subjectivity was thought to (iii)_____ research.\n\nStarting with the third blank: \"unbridled expression was thought to (iii)_____ research.\" If something is unbridled (uncontrolled), and it's about subjectivity, then it's probably bad for research. So the verb here should be negative. The options are corrupt, justification, expedite. Corrupt makes sense here. Justification doesn't fit, and expedite is positive, which doesn't fit the negative consequence. So (iii) is corrupt.\n\nNow, looking at the first blank: the methods were considered to (i)_____ those (ii)_____ subjectivity. The goal is to remove distortions caused by the researcher's subjectivity. So the methods are meant to control or limit that subjectivity. The options for (i) are restrain, reveal, disguise. Restrain fits here because they want to hold back or control the subjectivity. Reveal or disguise don't make sense in this context because the methods are about removing distortions, not showing or hiding them.\n\nNow the second blank: \"those (ii)_____ subjectivity\". The phrase is referring to the kind of subjectivity that the methods are restraining. The options are incursions of, restrictions on, acknowledgements of. Since the methods are trying to remove distortions caused by subjectivity, the subjectivity is something that's intruding or encroaching. So \"incursions of subjectivity\" makes sense. Incursions mean invasions or intrusions, which fits the idea of unwanted subjectivity. Restrictions on would imply they're limiting the restrictions, which doesn't fit. Acknowledgements of would mean they're recognizing subjectivity, but the sentence is about removing it, not acknowledging it.\n\nPutting it all together: The methods were to restrain those incursions of subjectivity whose unbridled expression would corrupt research. That makes sense. Restrain incursions of subjectivity to prevent corruption of research. So the answer should be restrain, incursions of, corrupt.\n</think>\n\nrestrain, incursions of, corrupt",

Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe first blank is (i) and the options are surfeit, reduction, stabilization. The sentence says that a (i) of choices can be paralyzing, referencing Schwartz's book The Paradox of Choice. From what I remember, the paradox of choice is the idea that having too many options can lead to decision paralysis. So, the first blank should mean an excess or too many. \"Surfeit\" means an excessive amount, so that fits. \"Reduction\" would be the opposite, and \"stabilization\" doesn't make sense here. So blank (i) is surfeit.\n\nMoving to the second blank (ii). The sentence says that a lack of flexibility in plans may actually be a (ii). The context here is that if too many choices are bad, then fewer choices (lack of flexibility) might be a good thing. So the blank should be a positive term. The options are virtue, conundrum, revelation. \"Virtue\" makes sense here because it's a positive attribute. A conundrum is a problem, which doesn't fit. Revelation is a discovery, which doesn't quite fit the context. So blank (ii) is virtue.\n\nNow the third blank (iii). The sentence says people reasonably (iii) some advantages in exchange for peace of mind. The options are foresee, forestall, forgo. The idea here is that people give up some advantages (like more choices) to have peace of mind. \"Forgo\" means to go without or give up, which fits. \"Foresee\" is to predict, and \"forestall\" is to prevent, which don't fit as well. So blank (iii) is forgo.\n\nPutting it all together: surfeit, virtue, forgo. Let me check again. First part: too many choices (surfeit) cause paralysis. Then, lack of flexibility (fewer choices) is a virtue. People forgo advantages (like more options) for peace of mind. Yep, that makes sense. The answer should be surfeit, virtue, forgo.\n</think>\n\nsurfeit, virtue, forgo",

Let me read through the question carefully.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"Although political events in different countries were not (i)_____ in the nineteenth century, their interrelationship was (ii)_____ compared with the present, when interdependence has become far greater: (iii)_____ has ceased to be an option.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the structure. The \"Although\" sets up a contrast between two things. The first part says that political events weren't (i) something in the 19th century. The second part contrasts that with their interrelationship being (ii) compared to now, where interdependence is greater. Then the third part says that (iii) is no longer an option.\n\nStarting with Blank (i). The options are unconnected, trivial, simultaneous. The sentence is saying that even though events weren't (i), their interrelationship was (ii) compared to now. The contrast here is between the past and present. Since the present has greater interdependence, the past must have had less. So, the first part of the sentence is saying that events weren't completely separate. The word \"Although\" suggests that even though they weren't (i), their relationship was still (ii). So, if (i) is \"unconnected,\" then the idea is that events were connected, but their interrelationship was less than now. Wait, but the structure is \"Although X, Y was Z compared to now when interdependence is greater.\" So, the interrelationship in the past was less than now. So, the first part is saying that events weren't (i), but their interrelationship was (ii) compared to now. So, if the interrelationship was less in the past, then the first blank might be saying that events weren't unconnected (i.e., they were connected), but their interrelationship was still superficial (maybe) compared to now. Wait, but the first blank is in the first clause. Let me think again.\n\nThe first part: \"Although political events in different countries were not (i)_____ in the nineteenth century...\" So, the \"although\" is setting up a contrast. The main clause is about the interrelationship being (ii) compared to now. So, the idea is that even though events weren't (i), their interrelationship was (ii) compared to now. If the interrelationship was less in the past, then maybe the first blank is saying that events weren't unconnected (so they were connected), but their interrelationship was still less than now. So, the first blank would be \"unconnected,\" because the sentence is saying \"Although they weren't unconnected (i.e., they were connected), their interrelationship was (ii) compared to now.\" Then, the second blank would be something like \"superficial\" or \"lesser.\" Let's check the options for Blank (ii): conditional, superficial, transparent. \"Superficial\" makes sense here, meaning their interrelationship was not deep compared to now. So, the first blank is \"unconnected,\" second is \"superficial.\"\n\nThen Blank (iii): \"has ceased to be an option.\" The options are isolationism, resilience, idealism. Since the sentence is talking about interdependence being greater now, the thing that's no longer an option would be isolationism. Because if countries are interdependent, they can't isolate themselves anymore. So, isolationism makes sense here.\n\nPutting it all together: Although political events weren't unconnected (they were connected), their interrelationship was superficial compared to now when interdependence is greater, so isolationism is no longer possible. That makes sense. Let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nFor Blank (i), the other options are trivial and simultaneous. If I picked \"simultaneous,\" that would mean events didn't happen at the same time, but the interrelationship was... Hmm, that doesn't fit as well. The contrast is about how connected they were, not timing. So \"unconnected\" is better. Trivial would mean the events weren't unimportant, but that doesn't contrast with interrelationship. So \"unconnected\" is correct.\n\nBlank (ii): superficial vs. transparent. If their interrelationship was transparent compared to now, that would mean it's more visible, but the sentence says interdependence is greater now. So \"superficial\" (shallow) makes sense as the past had less depth in their relationships.\n\nBlank (iii): isolationism fits because with greater interdependence, countries can't isolate themselves. So the answer should be unconnected, superficial, isolationism.\n</think>\n\nunconnected, superficial, isolationism",

Let me start by reading the entire sentence carefully to understand the context.\n\nThe first blank is about the quality of much contemporary drawing, which the author attributes to the use of photography as a shortcut. The options for Blank (i) are inert, jubilant, and sensuous. The sentence later mentions that the resulting art feels static and lifeless. So, the first blank should be a word that means something like static or lifeless. \"Inert\" fits here because it means lacking the ability to move or lacking vigor. \"Jubilant\" is happy, which doesn't make sense, and \"sensuous\" relates to the senses, which might not be negative. So, probably \"inert\" for Blank (i).\n\nMoving to Blank (ii): Photography [blank] modern arts. The options are \"frequently enervated,\" \"wonderfully enriched,\" and \"inevitably circumscribed.\" The sentence uses \"but\" to contrast the effect here. The first part says photography is a shortcut leading to inert quality, but when used as a tracing tool, the art is static. So, the first part of the sentence before the \"but\" might be acknowledging a positive role of photography. So, maybe \"wonderfully enriched\" makes sense here. Because the author is saying photography has enriched modern arts, but when used as a shortcut (tracing tool), it causes problems. That contrast makes sense. \"Enervated\" would mean weakened, which might not fit the contrast. \"Circumscribed\" means limited, but the sentence structure suggests a positive before the negative. So, \"wonderfully enriched\" for Blank (ii).\n\nNow Blank (iii): when photography is used as a tracing tool to [blank] the difficulties of achieving correct proportion. The options are augment, foreground, circumvent. The idea here is that using photography as a shortcut helps avoid the difficulties. \"Circumvent\" means to find a way around, which fits. \"Augment\" would mean to increase, which is the opposite. \"Foreground\" would mean to highlight, which also doesn't fit. So, \"circumvent\" for Blank (iii).\n\nPutting it all together: The inert quality is because photography is used as a shortcut. Photography has enriched modern arts, but when used to circumvent difficulties, the art becomes static. That makes sense. Let me check each part again.\n\nFirst blank: inert (matches static and lifeless). Second: wonderfully enriched (positive before the contrast). Third: circumvent (avoid the difficulties). Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\ninert, wonderfully enriched, circumvent",

Sage is a wise person, but master would imply someone highly skilled. Since the sentence mentions admiring her work, \"master\" makes sense as a compliment to her skill.\n\nNext, the second blank: she narrates with great skill and (ii)_____. Options are deliberation, enthusiasm, flamboyance. Deliberation means careful consideration, which pairs well with skill. Enthusiasm is more about energy, and flamboyance is showy.

So, the first blank should reflect that the performances require something from the audience. \"Made demands on\" fits here because it implies the audience has to put in effort. \"Were sure to please\" would contradict the \"not easy to digest\" part. \"Had to command\" might not fit as well because \"command an audience\" usually means to attract or hold attention, but the context is more about challenging them.\n\nNext, the second blank: \"But none of the techniques used would be (ii)_____ anyone with an interest in music or films.\" The options are \"contemplated by,\" \"alien to,\" or \"intuitive for.\" The sentence says that the techniques wouldn't be something for people interested in music or films. The next sentence mentions they'd seem strange only to those expecting traditional plays. So, the techniques are not strange (alien) to people with interests in music/films. So \"alien to\" would mean unfamiliar, but the sentence says they wouldn't be alien. Wait, the structure is \"none of the techniques would be alien to...\" which means the techniques are familiar to them. So \"alien to\" is the correct choice here. Because \"alien to\" means unfamiliar, and the sentence is saying they are not unfamiliar, so people with those interests would get it. \"Intuitive for\" might mean they find it natural, but the context is more about being unfamiliar. \"Contemplated by\" doesn't fit as well.\n\nThird blank: The actors felt critics' derisive comments showed the critics (iii)_____ the work.

Since other journals drain money, the Review must be the opposite. The options for Blank(i) are lucrative, realistic, or unesteemed. \"Lucrative\" means profitable, which makes sense here.

So Blank(ii) is \"authoritative\".\n\nFor Blank(iii), the sentence says that something, along with a certain aversion to risk-taking, has pervaded its pages. The options are an originality, an impulsiveness, a staleness. Since they mentioned \"not always lively and readable\" and \"aversion to risk taking\", the negative trait here would be staleness. Originality would be positive, but the context suggests a negative. Impulsiveness is the opposite of risk-averse, so that doesn't fit. So Blank(iii) is \"a staleness\".\n\nLet me check again. First blank: lucrative (profitable) fits the contrast. Second: authoritative pairs with erudite. Third: staleness makes sense with aversion to risk leading to being dull. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nlucrative, authoritative, a staleness",

The first blank says that cultures can do this in ways that (i)_____ conscious awareness or control. The options are operate outside of, tend to facilitate, may not alter.\n\nHmm. The sentence is saying that the shaping happens without people being consciously aware or in control. So, \"operate outside of\" makes sense here. Because if something operates outside of your awareness, you don't notice it. \"Tend to facilitate\" would mean it helps awareness, which doesn't fit. \"May not alter\" doesn't fit the context either. So Blank(i) is probably \"operate outside of\".\n\nNext, the second blank: cultural orientations develop from processes that do not entail (ii)_____ participation. The options are active, random, rote. The idea here is that people aren't deliberately participating. So if it's not active participation, then maybe passive. So \"active\" is the opposite. So the correct answer here is \"active\". Because if it's not active, then it's unconscious or automatic.

The first part says cultures shape attitudes without conscious awareness, so operate outside of. Then, processes that don't require active participation. And individuals can't report the subtle influences. Yeah, that makes sense. The final answer should be \"operate outside of, active, report\".\n</think>\n\noperate outside of, active, report",

Then, the third blank is about manufacturing a mythical past for public (iii)_____. \n\nStarting with the first blank. The options are \"elusive moments,\" \"marketable artifacts,\" or \"raging controversies.\" Since the sentence mentions that these groups love anniversaries, they probably turn historical events into something they can use. \"Marketable artifacts\" makes sense because they can be sold or promoted. \"Elusive moments\" don't seem to fit here, and \"raging controversies\" might not be something they love unless they thrive on conflict, but the context is about celebration.\n\nNext, the second blank: \"an authentic,\" \"a commercial,\" or \"an elitist\" culture of celebration. If the first blank is \"marketable,\" then the culture here is likely commercial. Marketable things are part of a commercial culture. \"Authentic\" doesn't fit because the sentence later mentions manufacturing a mythical past, which isn't authentic. \"Elitist\" also doesn't align with the idea of public consumption.\n\nThird blank: \"consumption,\" \"scrutiny,\" or \"censure.\" The sentence says the manufactured past is serviceable for public (iii)_____. If it's manufactured for the public, then \"consumption\" makes sense. They're creating something for the public to consume. \"Scrutiny\" would mean close examination, which doesn't fit the context of a manufactured myth. \"Censure\" is negative, which doesn't align with the positive terms like celebration and patriotic sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together: Historical events become marketable artifacts in a commercial culture of celebration, used for public consumption. That seems to flow logically. Let me check again. The first part is about making events into something sellable (marketable artifacts), in a commercial culture, and the end goal is public consumption. Yeah, that makes sense. The other options don't fit as well. So the answer should be marketable artifacts, a commercial, consumption.\n</think>\n\nmarketable artifacts, a commercial, consumption",

The structure has three blanks, and I need to figure out the right words for each.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: Laws are meant to stimulate creativity, but some creative works aren't protected. The author says this situation should be interesting. Then the next part is a conditional statement. If we see certain creative works (blank i) because of uncontrolled copying, we might decide to (blank ii) the law. Conversely, if unprotected work (blank iii) without legal rules, we should know how that's possible.\n\nFor blank (i), the options are languishing, proliferating, diversifying. The context here is about uncontrolled copying leading to a negative outcome. If copying is uncontrolled, maybe the creative work isn't doing well. \"Languishing\" means failing to make progress, which fits. \"Proliferating\" would mean increasing, which might not be bad, but the sentence implies a problem. \"Diversifying\" is about variety, which doesn't directly relate to the effect of copying. So probably \"languishing\" for (i).\n\nThen blank (ii): if the creative work is languishing due to copying, the response would be to strengthen the law. The options are jettison (get rid of), extend (expand), relax. If the problem is that copying is harming creativity, then maybe they need to extend the law to cover more. So \"extend\" makes sense here. If the law isn't protecting, extending it would help. So (ii) is \"extend\".\n\nFor the third blank, the converse situation: if unprotected work does well even without laws. The options are \"declines in originality\", \"manages to thrive\", \"openly invites imitation\". The sentence says if it does well, we should know how. So \"manages to thrive\" fits here. If it thrives without protection, that's the opposite scenario. So (iii) is \"manages to thrive\".\n\nPutting it all together: If creative work is languishing, extend the law.

The next part is \"the (ii)____________ of many individuals (iii)____________:\" followed by an explanation that the work of women and minority scientists has been exploited or considered not good enough for inclusion in history books. \n\nFirst, let's break down the structure. The main contrast here is introduced by \"Despite.\" So whatever is in blank (i) about contemporary science, the opposite is happening with the contributions of individuals. The colon after the third blank indicates that the part after the colon explains what's in the third blank. The example given is that women and minority scientists' work is exploited or deemed unworthy, which suggests their contributions are not recognized. So the third blank probably means that their contributions are ignored or not acknowledged. \n\nLooking at blank (iii) options: \"manifest themselves,\" \"point to a solution,\" \"remain overlooked.\" The example given shows that their work is not included, so \"remain overlooked\" makes sense here. So blank (iii) is likely \"remain overlooked.\"\n\nNow, blank (ii) refers to something of many individuals that remains overlooked. The example talks about their work being exploited or deemed unworthy. So the blank (ii) should be \"contributions,\" since their work (contributions) is being overlooked. The options are motivations, contributions, idiosyncrasies. \"Contributions\" fits here.\n\nNow blank (i): \"Despite the (i)____________ nature of contemporary science...\" The word \"despite\" sets up a contrast. If contemporary science is collaborative (working together), then even though it's collaborative, the contributions of individuals (maybe women and minorities) are overlooked. Alternatively, if it's controversial or sophisticated. Let's see. If science is collaborative, you'd expect teamwork and recognition, but despite that, some people's contributions are overlooked. That makes sense. So collaborative would create the contrast. Alternatively, if it's controversial, maybe there's disagreement, but how does that relate to overlooking contributions? Maybe not as directly. Sophisticated might not contrast as clearly. So \"collaborative\" seems better. Because even though science is a team effort, individual contributions (especially from certain groups) are still ignored. \n\nPutting it all together: Despite the collaborative nature of science, the contributions of many individuals remain overlooked. The example then explains that women and minorities' work is exploited or considered unworthy. That all fits.

So, the question is about children's truthfulness versus lying and how lying relates to cognitive development. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first blank: \"Given children's active fantasy lives, one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue in young children...\" The sentence starts by saying that because kids have active imaginations, people might assume truthfulness is a certain type of virtue. The key here is the contrast introduced by \"but it turns out that lying is the more (ii)_____ skill.\" So, the first blank is about how truthfulness is perceived, and the second is about lying being a more something skill.\n\nFor blank (i), the options are \"an instinctive,\" \"an acquired,\" or \"a conscious.\" If children have active fantasy lives, maybe people think that truthfulness isn't natural for them. But wait, the sentence is saying that because they have fantasy lives, one might think truthfulness is a certain virtue. If fantasy is natural, maybe truthfulness is seen as something they have to learn. So \"an acquired\" virtue? Because if they're naturally inclined to fantasy, truthfulness isn't instinctive but something they need to acquire. Alternatively, \"a conscious\" virtue might mean they have to think about it. But \"instinctive\" would mean it's natural, which might contrast with the idea that lying is more advanced. Hmm. Let's hold that thought.\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"lying is the more (ii)_____ skill.\" The options are \"advanced,\" \"practical,\" \"mundane.\" The following sentences explain that lying requires recognizing the truth, conceiving an alternate reality, and selling it. So lying is a complex skill. Therefore, \"advanced\" seems to fit here. \"Practical\" might not capture the complexity, and \"mundane\" is the opposite. So probably \"advanced\" for blank (ii).\n\nNow, the third blank: \"Therefore, lying (iii)_____ cognitive development and social skills...\" The options are \"undermines,\" \"forgoes,\" \"demands.\" The sentence is explaining that lying requires those skills, so lying must require or demand cognitive development. \"Demands\" makes sense here. If lying needs those skills, then it demands them. \"Undermines\" would mean it harms them, which doesn't fit the context. \"Forgoes\" means to do without, which also doesn't make sense. So \"demands\" for blank (iii).\n\nGoing back to blank (i). If lying is an advanced skill that requires cognitive development, then truthfulness might be considered a more basic or instinctive virtue. Wait, but the first part says \"given children's active fantasy lives,\" which might lead someone to think that truthfulness is not natural. Wait, the structure is \"one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue... but lying is more advanced.\" So if lying is advanced, then truthfulness is seen as something more basic. But the options for (i) are \"instinctive,\" \"acquired,\" \"conscious.\" If people think that because kids have active fantasies, they might assume truthfulness is not natural (i.e., acquired), but the \"but\" introduces that lying is actually more advanced. Wait, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. The sentence is saying that despite their fantasy lives (which might make you think they lie a lot), you might think truthfulness is an instinctive virtue (natural), but actually lying is more advanced. Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me re-read.\n\nOriginal sentence: \"Given children's active fantasy lives, one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue in young children, but it turns out that lying is the more (ii)_____ skill.\" So the logic is that because kids have active fantasies (which could be linked to lying), people might think truthfulness is hard for them (so maybe not instinctive). But the \"but\" says lying is more advanced. So perhaps the initial thought is that truthfulness is an acquired virtue (needs to be learned) because their fantasy lives make lying easier. But the reality is that lying is actually more advanced. So blank (i) would be \"an acquired\" virtue, meaning people think kids have to learn to be truthful, but lying is more advanced. Wait, but if lying is advanced, then maybe truthfulness is instinctive. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nIf children have active fantasy lives, maybe adults think that they are naturally inclined to make up stories, so truthfulness isn't something they do instinctively. Therefore, adults might think truthfulness is an \"acquired\" virtue (something they have to learn) rather than instinctive. But the sentence says \"but it turns out that lying is the more advanced skill.\" So the contrast is between thinking truthfulness is acquired (needs to be taught) vs. lying being advanced (which is actually harder, so maybe truthfulness is more instinctive). Wait, this is confusing. Let's see: if lying is more advanced, then it's a higher skill. So the initial assumption might be that truthfulness is natural (instinctive), but the reality is that lying is more advanced. But the first part says \"given children's active fantasy lives,\" which might lead one to think that lying comes naturally (so truthfulness is acquired). But the \"but\" introduces that lying is actually more advanced. So maybe the initial thought is that truthfulness is an instinctive virtue (since kids are honest by nature), but the reality is that lying is advanced. But the given that they have active fantasy lives, maybe the initial thought is that truthfulness is not instinctive. Hmm. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first blank is \"an instinctive\" virtue. If people think that because kids have active fantasies, they might assume that truthfulness is not instinctive (since they make up stories), but the sentence structure is \"one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue... but lying is more advanced.\" Wait, the structure is that despite their fantasy lives (which might make you think they lie a lot), you might think truthfulness is X, but actually lying is more advanced. So perhaps the initial assumption is that truthfulness is an acquired virtue (needs to be taught) because kids are naturally prone to fantasy (lying), but the reality is that lying is actually a more advanced skill. So blank (i) is \"an acquired\" virtue. That makes sense. Because people might think that since kids have active imaginations, they need to learn to be truthful (acquired), but in reality, lying is more advanced, so it's actually a skill that requires development. Therefore, the answer for blank (i) is \"an acquired,\" blank (ii) is \"advanced,\" and blank (iii) is \"demands.\" Let me check the third blank again: \"lying (iii)_____ cognitive development and social skills in a way that honesty simply does not.\" If lying requires those skills, then it \"demands\" them. Yes. So the final answer would be \"an acquired, advanced, demands.\" Wait, but the options for blank (i) are \"an instinctive; an acquired; a conscious.\" So \"an acquired\" is correct. Yes. That makes sense. So the answer is \"an acquired, advanced, demands.\"\n</think>\n\nan acquired, advanced, demands",

Then, the next part mentions founding myths (i)_____ the equal division of labor in child care for mothers and fathers. The options for blank (i) are obscure, celebrate, or countermand. \n\nSince the culture promotes gender equality, the founding myths would likely support that idea. So, \"celebrate\" makes sense here. If they celebrated the equal division, that aligns with promoting equality. Obscure would mean hiding it, which doesn't fit. Countermand means to go against, which would contradict the first sentence. So blank (i) is probably \"celebrate.\"\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"As is often the case, however, theoretical commitments are (ii)_____ actual processes.\" The options here are incommensurate with, surpassed by, inspired by. The sentence structure here is contrasting the theoretical commitments (like the founding myths promoting equality) with the reality. So the theoretical part doesn't match the actual. \"Incommensurate with\" means not corresponding in size or quality, so that fits. Surpassed by would mean the actual processes are better, but the next sentence says that gender-based something persists, which is negative. Inspired by would mean the actual processes are driven by the theories, which contradicts the contrast. So blank (ii) is \"incommensurate with.\"\n\nThird blank: \"In reality, gender-based (iii)_____ persists.\" The options are parity, inclusiveness, stratification. Since the first part talks about promoting equality but the reality is different, the blank should be something negative.

The options are remoteness from, ignorance of, or access to. The key here is that despite having something, they couldn't impose their will. So, if they had access to superior resources, that would make sense. \"Remoteness from\" would mean they were far away from resources, which doesn't fit because they have them. \"Ignorance of\" also doesn't make sense because they have the resources. So, Blank(i) is probably \"access to\".\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"Nor could they assume that properly functioning markets... would (ii)____________.\" The options are spontaneously emerge, ultimately fail, or occasionally struggle. The sentence is saying that they couldn't just assume the markets would do something on their own. If they had to develop strategies, it's because the markets wouldn't just form by themselves. So \"spontaneously emerge\" makes sense here. If markets emerged on their own, they wouldn't need strategies. If they assumed markets would fail or struggle, that might not fit the context of needing to develop strategies. So Blank(ii) is likely \"spontaneously emerge\".\n\nThird blank: \"they had to develop strategies to (iii)____________ such markets...\" The options are construct, restrain, serve. Since they couldn't assume markets would emerge on their own, they had to build or create them. \"Construct\" fits here. \"Restrain\" would mean holding back, which doesn't make sense. \"Serve\" would imply they are serving existing markets, but the context is about creating them. So Blank(iii) is \"construct\".\n\nPutting it all together: access to, spontaneously emerge, construct. Let me check again. The firms had access to resources but couldn't impose their will. They couldn't assume markets would emerge on their own, so they had to construct them. That makes sense. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\naccess to, spontaneously emerge, construct",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i): The sentence says that in adolescence, certain interactions are crucial for forging self-identity. The options are adult, wide-ranging, or peer. Well, during adolescence, peers are really important because teenagers are more influenced by their friends than adults. So \"peer interactions\" make sense here. Adult interactions might be part of it, but the key here is that peers are central during that age. Wide-ranging could imply variety, but the context is about forging identity, which is often through peers.\n\nMoving to Blank (ii): The process plays out in something as a means of defining and shoring up the self. The options are cliquish social behavior, dramatic changes in personality, or heightened sociability. The next sentence mentions kids seeking like-minded companions and spurning others. That sounds like forming cliques. Cliquish behavior would fit here because forming groups and excluding others is a way to define their identity. Dramatic personality changes might be a result, but the sentence is talking about the process, which is the behavior. Heightened sociability is positive, but the example given is about exclusion, so cliquish makes more sense.\n\nNow Blank (iii): When kept within bounds, this in-group something evolves into mature friendships. The options are alienation, clustering, competition. The previous part talks about forming cliques (clustering together), so in-group clustering. If they cluster in groups, and if that's kept reasonable, it becomes mature. Alienation would be negative, and competition isn't directly related to forming groups. Clustering fits here as the natural result of forming cliques. So the answer would be clustering.\n\nPutting it all together: peer interactions, cliquish social behavior, clustering. Let me check again. First blank: peer interactions crucial for identity. Second: cliquish behavior as part of the process. Third: in-group clustering evolves into mature friendships. Yes, that makes sense. The other options don't fit as well. So the final answer should be peer, cliquish social behavior, clustering.\n</think>\n\npeer, cliquish social behavior, clustering",

The options for blank (i) are requires, demonstrated, symbolizes.\n\n\"Requires\" seems to fit here because the myth would necessitate that belief. \"Demonstrated\" might not make sense because the myth isn't proving something, it's asserting. \"Symbolizes\" doesn't fit the context. So blank (i) is probably \"requires\".\n\nNext, the second blank: \"can easily be (ii)_____ by pointing out...\" The myth is being countered by evidence. The options are augmented, debunked, traced. \"Debunked\" makes sense here because they're disproving the myth. \"Augmented\" would mean making it stronger, which is the opposite. \"Traced\" doesn't fit.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i). The sentence says \"therapies for every conceivable (i)_____ from broken bones to liver complaints.\" The options are malady, indiscretion, prognosis. Well, broken bones and liver complaints are types of illnesses or health issues. \"Malady\" means a disease or ailment, which fits here. \"Indiscretion\" is more about lack of judgment, which doesn't make sense. \"Prognosis\" is a forecast of the course of a disease, so that's not something you have therapies for. So Blank (i) is probably \"malady.\"\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The local mud, saltwater, etc., have been deemed (ii)_____ by the German medical system. The options are healthful, suspect, innocuous. The sentence continues that the medical system does something with these treatments, and consequently they're widely used. If the medical system approves them, then they must consider them beneficial. So \"healthful\" makes sense. If they thought they were suspect or innocuous (harmless but maybe not effective), then maybe they wouldn't fund them. But since the treatments are widely used, being deemed healthful would lead to that. So Blank (ii) is likely \"healthful.\"\n\nThen Blank (iii): The German medical system (iii)_____ some of these treatments. The options are doubts, denies, funds. If the system funds them, that explains why they're widely used. If they doubted or denied them, that would contradict their widespread use. So \"funds\" fits here. So putting it all together: malady, healthful, funds. Let me check again. The medical system deems them healthful and funds them, leading to their use. Yes, that makes sense. The other options don't fit as well. For example, if the system denied the treatments, they wouldn't be used. If they were suspect, maybe the system doubts them. But the sentence says the treatments are widely used, so the positive options fit better. So the answer should be malady, healthful, funds.\n</think>\n\nmalady, healthful, funds",

Even though his method is innovative, the study is about something that's not new. So, the first blank should be something like \"well-known\" or \"already studied.\" Looking at the options for Blank(i): unfamiliar, well-worked, fruitful. \"Well-worked\" seems to fit here because it means the ground has been thoroughly examined before. \"Fruitful\" might imply it's productive, but the contrast is about being new vs. old. So, Blank(i) is probably \"well-worked.\"\n\nNext, the second part mentions that the Norwegian subculture is a \"particularly well-studied area.\" So, scholars who know this area well would find Thaler's study lacking. The second blank: \"Anyone familiar... will (ii)_____ little in Thaler's study...\" The options are find, understand, reveal. The verb here should indicate that they don't find much. \"Find\" makes sense because they won't discover much new. \"Reveal\" would be active on the study's part, but the subject is the scholars, so \"find\" is better. So Blank(ii) is \"find.\"\n\nThen, the third blank: \"little in Thaler's study that is (iii)_____.\" Since the area is well-studied, the scholars won't find much that's new.

Indeed, many biologists claim that this attribute, the ability to (iii)_____, or, to put it more sharply, to make individuals subordinate their self-interest to the needs of the group, lies at the root of human achievement.\"\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The first blank is about biologists' attitude towards drawing a link. The options are \"consensus regarding,\" \"compunction about,\" or \"justification for.\" The phrase \"have little\" suggests that they don't have much of something. If it's \"consensus regarding,\" that would mean they don't agree much. \"Compunction about\" would mean they don't feel guilty or hesitant. \"Justification for\" would mean they lack reasons. The sentence says \"indeed\" introduces a supporting statement, so maybe the first part is saying biologists don't hesitate to make the link. So \"compunction about\" makes sense here because compunction means hesitation due to guilt. So blank (i) is \"compunction about.\"\n\nMoving to blank (ii), the link is between humanity's success and human something. The options are resilience, sociability, uniqueness. The next sentence talks about an attribute that allows people to subordinate self-interest to the group. That sounds like sociability, working together. So blank (ii) is \"sociability.\"\n\nThen blank (iii) is the ability to do something. The explanation is making individuals work for the group. The options are reflect, communicate, cooperate. Cooperate fits perfectly here. So blank (iii) is \"cooperate.\"\n\nLet me check again. First blank: \"little compunction about\" means they don't hesitate. Then the link is between success and sociability. The attribute is cooperation. That all makes sense. The answer should be compunction about, sociability, cooperate.\n</think>\n\ncompunction about, sociability, cooperate",

Let me read through the entire sentence carefully.\n\nThe first blank is (i), and the options are \"even more troubling,\" \"more difficult to understand,\" or \"much less interesting.\" The sentence starts by saying that the ethical implications of neuroscience may be [blank] than those of genetics. Then it explains that manipulating neurons leads to more predictable and thorough behavior changes than altering genes. Hmm. So if neuroscience's methods are more predictable and thorough, maybe the ethical implications are more significant. So \"even more troubling\" makes sense here because if you can change behavior more effectively, the ethical issues might be bigger. \"More difficult to understand\" doesn't fit because the paragraph is about the effectiveness of the methods, not complexity. \"Much less interesting\" contradicts the idea that neuroscience's implications are more significant. So I think blank (i) is \"even more troubling.\"\n\nNext, blank (ii) options are \"solidified,\" \"surfaced,\" or \"vanished.\" The sentence says even if the ethical and practical constraints on genetic experimentation suddenly [blank], we'd have to wait decades for results. The idea here is that even if those constraints went away, it's still slow. So \"vanished\" fits because if constraints vanish, they're removed. \"Solidified\" would mean they became stronger, which doesn't make sense in this context. \"Surfaced\" means appeared, which is the opposite of what's needed here. So blank (ii) is \"vanished.\"\n\nFinally, blank (iii) options are \"unexpected,\" \"rapid,\" or \"far-reaching.\" The sentence contrasts genetic experiments taking decades with altering the brain's functioning producing [blank] results. Since altering the brain can be done more quickly (as opposed to waiting decades), \"rapid\" makes sense. \"Unexpected\" might not fit because the first part mentioned that neuroscience's changes are more predictable. \"Far-reaching\" could work, but the contrast is about time, not extent. So \"rapid\" is the best fit here.\n\nPutting it all together: even more troubling, vanished, rapid. Let me check again. The first part says neuroscience's implications are more troubling. Then, even if genetic constraints vanished, we wait decades. Brain alterations have rapid results. Yes, that makes sense.

The first part says the power of laughter to affect perceived funniness is (i)____. The researchers found that including laughter does something to the overall perception. The word \"although\" in the next clause suggests a contrast. So, the main finding is that laughter does X to the overall perception, but it can do Y at specific points, which helps boost the total. \n\nIf most researchers found that including laughter has a certain effect on the overall perception, but it can do something else at specific points, then the first blank might be \"unclear\" if there's conflicting results. Wait, but the colon says that the first part is explained by the rest. So if the first blank is \"unclear,\" then the explanation would be that researchers found something. But the sentence structure is that the first part is a claim, and the colon introduces the evidence. So maybe the first blank is \"measurable\" because the researchers have found effects. But the colon is saying that the power is (i)____, and then the research supports that. Wait, but the sentence says \"most researchers have found that inclusion of laughter (ii)____ the overall perception... although it can (iii)____ humor at specific points.\" So the overall effect is one thing, but at specific points, another. The \"although\" suggests that despite the overall effect, there's a specific effect that's different. Wait, but the third part says \"thus boost the total comic appeal.\" So even though the overall perception might be X, the specific points do Y, which helps boost the total. Hmm.\n\nLet me parse this again. The first blank is about the power of laughter to affect perceived funniness. The colon introduces the research findings. So if the first blank is \"unclear,\" then the research is clarifying it. But the research says that including laughter does something to the overall perception, but can do something else at specific points. Wait, the first part is saying that the power is (i)____. If the answer is \"unclear,\" then the colon would explain why it's unclear. But the research findings here seem to present a mixed result. For example, if the overall effect is little, but specific points are enhanced, leading to a total boost. So maybe the first blank is \"unclear\" because the effect isn't straightforward. But the colon is supposed to explain the first statement. Let's see: \"The power of laughter to affect the perceived funniness of television programming is unclear: most researchers have found that inclusion of laughter on a program's soundtrack has little effect on the overall perception of humor, although it can enhance humor at specific points and thus boost the total comic appeal.\" That makes sense. The colon is explaining why it's unclear: because while overall there's little effect, specific points are enhanced, leading to a total boost. So the overall effect is not clear (unclear), but specific points are better. Alternatively, if the first blank is \"measurable,\" then the colon would explain that the effect is measurable because researchers found that it accentuates the overall perception. But the \"although\" clause complicates that. Let's check the options again.\n\nBlank (i) options: cumulative, measurable, unclear.\n\nIf the first blank is \"unclear,\" then the explanation is that even though most researchers found that including laughter has little effect on overall perception (so maybe the overall effect is not there), but at specific points, it enhances, thus boosting the total. So the overall effect is unclear because the research shows conflicting aspects. That makes sense. So (i) is unclear. Then (ii) would be \"has little effect on,\" and (iii) would be \"enhance.\" Because even though overall it doesn't do much, at specific points it enhances, leading to a total boost. Then the final answer would be unclear, has little effect on, enhance. Let me check the options again.\n\nBlank (ii) options: allows variations in; tends to accentuate; has little effect on.\n\nIf (ii) is \"has little effect on,\" then (iii) is \"enhance,\" which would make sense. The overall effect is little, but specific points are enhanced, so the total is boosted. That fits. Then the first blank is \"unclear\" because the effect isn't straightforward. Alternatively, if (i) is \"measurable,\" then the colon would explain that the effect is measurable because researchers found that it accentuates the overall perception. But the \"although\" part would then say that it can enhance at specific points. But that would mean that the overall effect is accentuated, and also specific points are enhanced, which seems redundant. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, if (i) is \"measurable,\" then the research shows that it has an effect. But the sentence structure with \"although\" suggests a contrast. So if (ii) is \"tends to accentuate,\" then the overall perception is increased, but (iii) would need to be something that also contributes. But the \"although\" implies that despite the overall effect, there's a specific effect. Wait, \"although it appears that it can (iii)____ humor at specific points and thus boost the total.\" So if the overall perception is accentuated, but at specific points, it does something else that also boosts. That seems contradictory. Maybe the overall effect is not the same as the specific points. For example, maybe the overall perception is not much affected, but at specific points, it's enhanced, leading to a total boost. So (ii) is \"has little effect on,\" (iii) is \"enhance.\" Then the first blank is \"unclear\" because the effect is not straightforward. That seems to fit. So the answer would be unclear, has little effect on, enhance. Let me check the options again. Yes, that's possible. Alternatively, maybe (i) is \"measurable\" if the effect is that overall it's accentuated, but the \"although\" part says that even though it can enhance specific points, which would add to the total. But that doesn't make much sense. If the overall is accentuated, then the specific points being enhanced would just add to that. The \"although\" would need a contrast. So perhaps the overall effect is not accentuated, but the specific points are. So the first blank is \"unclear,\" (ii) is \"has little effect on,\" (iii) is \"enhance.\" That seems to fit.

So, the question is about the analysis of fossils from Pakistan related to early whale ancestors, specifically Maiacetus inuus. The sentence has three blanks, and I need to choose the correct word for each from the given options.\n\nStarting with the first blank: \"Maiacetus inuus was a land animal (i)_____ life in the sea.\" The options are resistant, removed from, adapted to. The sentence is talking about an ancestor of modern whales, which are sea creatures. So, the transition from land to sea would mean that this animal was adapting to sea life. \"Adapted to\" makes sense here. \"Resistant\" would imply it's fighting against sea life, which doesn't fit. \"Removed from\" would mean it's not part of the sea, but the context suggests it's moving towards it. So, first blank is probably \"adapted to.\"\n\nNext, the second blank: \"But it probably spent much of its time (ii)_____: its big teeth were suited for catching fish...\" The options here are in the water, fleeing from predators, protecting its young. The colon indicates that the part after explains why. Since the teeth are for catching fish, which live in water, the animal must have spent time in the water. So \"in the water\" fits here. The other options don't connect as directly to catching fish.\n\nThird blank: \"its flipper-like feet must have been (iii)_____ walking.\" Options are incompatible with, clumsy for, strengthened by. The sentence says \"flipper-like feet,\" which are more suited for swimming than walking. So if they have flipper feet, walking would be difficult. \"Clumsy for\" makes sense. \"Incompatible with\" might be too strong, but possible. \"Strengthened by\" doesn't fit because flipper feet aren't good for walking. So between \"clumsy for\" and \"incompatible with.\" The sentence says \"must have been,\" which suggests a conclusion based on evidence. If the feet are flipper-like, they might be awkward for walking, so \"clumsy for\" is more likely. \"Incompatible\" might mean they can't walk at all, but the first part mentions it's a land animal adapted to sea, so it probably could walk, just not well. So \"clumsy for\" is better.\n\nPutting it all together: adapted to, in the water, clumsy for. Let me check again. The first blank: adapted to life in the sea. Second: in the water because of fish-catching teeth. Third: flipper feet are clumsy for walking. Yes, that makes sense.

The key here is that they thought his compliance was obsequiousness, which means being overly obedient or servile. But the sentence says they \"took... compliance for obsequiousness\" which implies they misunderstood his behavior. So if they thought he was being obsequious when he was actually compliant in an old-mannered way, then they misjudged him. So blank (i) should be \"misconstrued\" because that means misunderstood. Condemned would be if they criticized him, but the sentence doesn't say they did that, just that they misread his behavior. Respected doesn't fit here because the colon after the first part introduces an explanation that his apparent something veiled a fervent something else. So the first blank is probably misconstrued.\n\nMoving to blank (ii): his apparent ____ veiled a fervent ____. The options are cynicism, acquiescence, intractability. Since the first part was about compliance being mistaken for obsequiousness, his apparent behavior must be something that looks compliant. Acquiescence means agreement or compliance, so that fits. If he appeared to acquiesce, but actually had a fervent feeling. So blank (ii) is acquiescence.\n\nThen blank (iii): a fervent ____ of the authority. The options are veneration, justification, detestation. The sentence says he occasionally expressed this by sabotaging their projects. Sabotage implies he dislikes the authority. So detestation makes sense here. Veneration is respect, which would contradict the sabotage. Justification doesn't fit because sabotaging wouldn't justify authority. So detestation is the right choice.\n\nPutting it all together: They misconstrued him because his apparent acquiescence hid his detestation, leading him to sabotage projects.

The options for blank (i) are superseded, halted, caused. The theories are opposing, so one says mountain building led to cooling, the other says cooling led to mountain building. So the first blank should be a word that indicates causation. \"Caused\" makes sense here. If the first theory says mountain building caused the cooling, then the other would say the cooling caused the mountain building. So blank (i) is likely \"caused\".\n\nMoving to the second blank: The first theory says that mountain building cooled the earth due to the (ii)_____ mountains and climate. The options are disparity between, feedback between, complexity of. The example given is about mountain glaciers increasing reflectivity, which lowers temperatures, leading to more ice. That sounds like a feedback loop. So \"feedback between\" mountains and climate. The process where mountains affect climate, which in turn affects the mountains (maybe through glaciers).

The options are unpredictable, static, self-perpetuating. The description here is that once they start, they keep themselves going. So \"self-perpetuating\" fits.

The next part says the frog doesn't (ii)_____ them. So, the mystery is about where the toxins come from since the frog doesn't produce them. The answer for (i) should be \"origin\" because the question is about where the toxins come from. Then, for (ii), if the frog doesn't produce them, the verb should be \"produce.\" That makes sense because if they don't make the toxins themselves, the origin is a mystery.\n\nNow the third part says that an analysis points to melyrid beetles. Collected beetles had the toxins, so the beetles are (iii)_____ by the frogs. If the frogs get the toxins from the beetles, then the beetles must be eaten by the frogs. So (iii) is \"eaten.\" The other options like \"neutralized\" or \"poisoned\" don't fit because if the frogs eat the beetles and take their toxins, the beetles are a food source.

The next sentence says it's not just new collectors causing this intensification. So \"intensification\" here probably relates to the first blank. If auctions are becoming more intense, maybe they're more competitive. Because more collectors (both new and established) would drive up competition. So blank (i) might be competitive.\n\nThen the second blank: Established collectors' interests are also becoming more (ii)_____. The third sentence says that those who once focused on either 19th or 20th-century works now want (iii)_____ collections. So if they used to focus on one era but now want something else, maybe their interests have broadened. So blank (ii) could be wide-ranging. That would make sense because if their interests are wider, they might collect both eras now. So (ii) is wide-ranging.\n\nFor blank (iii), if they used to concentrate on one era but now want something more, the collections would be comprehensive. Because comprehensive means covering all aspects, so combining both eras. Legitimate doesn't fit here, and impressive is possible but the context is about scope, not impressiveness. So (iii) is comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together: competitive (i), wide-ranging (ii), comprehensive (iii).

If the repertoire is \"rich,\" that means there's a lot of variety, which would make it hard to tease apart each signal's meaning. If it were \"precise\" or \"straightforward,\" that might make it easier, not harder. So blank (i) is probably \"rich.\"\n\nMoving to the second blank. The sentence starts with \"This (ii)_____ is...\" The \"this\" refers back to the difficulty mentioned earlier. So the problem the researchers have is the difficulty.

So we need a word that means made worse or increased. \"Augmented\" can mean increased, so that fits. \"Ameliorated\" would mean improved, which doesn't make sense here. \"Anticipated\" doesn't fit because the shifting isn't something they predicted; it's contributing to the problem.\n\nPutting it all together: rich, problem, augmented. The explanation would be that a rich repertoire causes difficulty, which is a problem made worse by shifting meanings.\n</think>\n\nrich, problem, augmented\nExplanation: The first blank requires a term indicating a complex variety of signals, so \"rich\" fits.

The sentence says that in 1998, observations of a (i)___ in methane growth suggested that the 1995 scenarios were overly (ii)___. Then, it says \"celebration was premature\" because later research found the phenomena were due to (iii)___ declines in emissions. \n\nSo, the first part talks about something observed in methane growth that made people think the previous scenarios were too something. Then, the \"however\" indicates a contrast. The initial observation made them think the scenarios were wrong, but later research showed the real cause was something else. \n\nFor blank (i), the options are spike, slowdown, fluctuation. If the scenarios were overly something, maybe they were too pessimistic. If methane growth slowed down, that would mean less greenhouse gas, so the scenarios predicting bad effects might have been too gloomy. But if there was a spike, that would mean more methane, making scenarios perhaps not gloomy enough. Wait, but the second part says the celebration was premature. So if the initial observation made them think things were better (so they celebrated), but then it turned out not to be. So the initial observation must have been a slowdown. Because if methane growth slowed, that's good news, leading to celebration. But then they found out it was due to temporary declines. So blank (i) is slowdown. \n\nThen blank (ii): the scenarios may have been overly... If the slowdown suggested that the scenarios were too negative, then \"gloomy\" makes sense. Because if methane wasn't increasing as much, the previous predictions of high methane leading to warming would be too pessimistic. So overly gloomy. The other options, detailed or ambitious don't fit here. \n\nBlank (iii): the subsequent research showed the declines were caused by something in emissions. The celebration was premature because the slowdown wasn't permanent. So the declines in emissions must have been temporary. If they were temporary, then the slowdown was just a short-term thing, not a long-term trend. So the answer here is temporary. \n\nPutting it all together: slowdown in growth (i) made people think the scenarios were too gloomy (ii), but actually, the emissions declines were temporary (iii).

The contrast (\"however\") shows the initial optimism was unwarranted, requiring \"slowdown\" (i) to trigger relief, \"gloomy\" (ii) as the overestimated negative outlook, and \"temporary\" (iii) explaining why the slowdown wasn't sustained.",

The first sentence says that both very good and very bad books are easy to review. Then it mentions that praise and something (blank i) come easily. The next part talks about books that are a mix of virtues and vices, making the reviewer's task more (blank ii). The third blank is about separating the useful observations from the useless ones.\n\nStarting with the first blank. The sentence says \"Praise and (i)_____ come easily.\" Since it's about both very good and very bad books, the opposite of praise would be criticism. The options are ambivalence, compliment, censure. Compliment is similar to praise, so that's not the opposite. Censure means strong criticism, so that fits. Ambivalence is having mixed feelings, which doesn't contrast with praise. So blank i is censure.\n\nNext, the second blank. The task is more (ii)_____ when the book is a muddle. Since good and bad are easy, a mix would be harder. The options are evident, demanding, manageable. Demanding makes sense here because it's more challenging. So blank ii is demanding.\n\nThird blank: the useful observations need to be (iii)_____ the useless. The reviewer has to separate them. The options are supplanted by (replaced), sifted from (separated), overshadowed by. Sifted from is the correct choice here because it means separating the good from the bad. So blank iii is sifted from.\n\nPutting it all together: censure, demanding, sifted from.\n</think>\n\ncensure, demanding, sifted from\nExplanation: The passage contrasts easy reviews (for clearly good/bad books) with challenging ones (for mixed-quality books). Blank(i) requires an antonym of \"praise\" (censure = criticism). Blank(ii) needs a term indicating difficulty (demanding). Blank(iii) requires a separation process (sifted from = separated from).",

So, since unambiguous texts are clear, the first blank should be something positive like \"understand\" or \"comprehend.\" The options are misunderstand, comprehend, complicate. Comprehend makes sense here.\n\nNext, the second blank: \"but ambiguous texts can have the attractive (ii)_____ of multiple possible interpretations.\" The word \"attractive\" suggests a positive connotation. The options are stigma, blemish, allure. Stigma and blemish are negative, so allure fits here. So the second blank is allure.\n\nThird blank: \"all of which can be considered equally (iii)_____, and none of which is the single true meaning.\" The idea is that each interpretation is acceptable or legitimate. The options are valid, frank, inveterate. Valid means logically sound, which fits. Frank means honest, which doesn't fit. Inveterate means habitual, which also doesn't fit.

So, the passage is about how computers make it easy to search for information in texts, and how doing research this way can feel a certain way (Blank i). Then it contrasts this with instead of doing something (Blank ii) the organizing logic of the book, allowing you to approach with your own questions and do something else (Blank iii). The main idea seems to be that using computers for targeted research gives the reader control, making them the master instead of the author.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The sentence says that doing research in this targeted way can feel ____. The next part starts with \"Instead of...\" which suggests a contrast. The author is comparing two approaches. The first approach (using computers) is presented positively because you're not following the book's structure but using your own questions. So the feeling here should be positive. The options are disorienting (negative), humbling (could be either, but maybe negative), empowering (positive). Empowering fits because it gives the user control, which aligns with \"You, not the author, are the master.\"\n\nBlank (ii): The phrase here is \"Instead of ____ the organizing logic of the book...\" The alternative is approaching with your own questions. So the original method (without computers) would involve following the book's structure. The blank should mean something like following or adhering to. The options are disregarding (opposite), surrendering to (giving in to), imitating (copying). \"Surrendering to\" makes sense here because it implies yielding to the book's structure, which contrasts with using your own approach.\n\nBlank (iii): The result of approaching with your own questions is that you can ____. The options are about the outcome. Since you're using your own questions, you want to get exactly what you need. \"Glean precisely what you want\" fits because it's about extracting specific information. The other options involve understanding the author's intent or evaluating the book as it is, which would be more traditional methods, not the targeted search approach.\n\nPutting it all together: Empowering (i) because it gives control, surrendering to (ii) the book's logic is what you avoid, and glean precisely (iii) what you want. The explanation ties into the contrast between passive reading and active, targeted research using computers.\n</think>\n\nempowering, surrendering to, glean precisely what you want from it  \nExplanation: The passage contrasts traditional research (following a book's structure) with computer-assisted targeted research. Blank (i) requires a positive term reflecting control, so \"empowering.\" Blank (ii) contrasts with asserting one's own questions, so \"surrendering to\" the book's logic. Blank (iii) aligns with extracting specific information, hence \"glean precisely what you want.\" The overall theme emphasizes user agency over passive adherence to the author's structure.",

So what kind of species would be surprising to become endangered? Maybe ones that are currently doing well. The options are exotic, vulnerable, now common. If even common species are at risk, that makes sense. Exotic might not be the opposite of endangered. Vulnerable would mean they're already at risk, but the sentence says \"even\" which implies a contrast. So probably \"now common\" for blank (i).\n\nNext, Blank (ii): \"Ongoing conservation management is (ii)_____, as we have become nature...\" The reason given is that we've become nature, so the management is necessary. The options are ineffective, obligatory, promising. Obligatory fits here because if we are now acting as nature, then it's a duty. So obligatory for (ii).\n\nBlank (iii): \"responsibilities... cannot be (iii)_____.\" The phrase \"cannot be\" suggests that we can't avoid or get rid of the responsibilities. The options are jettisoned (discarded), assumed (taken on), contrived (created artificially). So \"jettisoned\" makes sense here. We can't discard the responsibilities. So (iii) is jettisoned.\n\nPutting it all together: now common, obligatory, jettisoned. The explanation would be that even common species are at risk, so conservation is obligatory and responsibilities can't be discarded.\n</think>\n\nnow common, obligatory, jettisoned\nExplanation: The first blank requires a contrast with \"endangered,\" so \"now common\" species becoming endangered highlights the severity. \"Obligatory\" fits the second blank as conservation becomes a duty when humans \"become nature.\" The third blank uses \"jettisoned\" (discarded) to emphasize that responsibilities cannot be abandoned.",

The passage is about fairy tales being narratives of wish fulfillment and teaching lessons about struggles in life. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure. The sentence has three parts connected by \"that\" clauses, each explaining what the fairy tales teach. The first blank (i) is in the first teaching point: \"a struggle against severe difficulties in life is (i)_____.\" The options are atypical, unavoidable, insurmountable. The passage says these struggles are an intrinsic part of human existence. Intrinsic means essential or inherent, so if something is intrinsic, it's a natural part. So the first blank should mean something that's a necessary part. \"Unavoidable\" fits here because if it's intrinsic, you can't avoid it. Atypical would mean it's not typical, which contradicts intrinsic. Insurmountable means can't be overcome, but the third part says you can master obstacles, so insurmountable might not fit here. So blank (i) is unavoidable.\n\nNext, blank (ii): \"if one does not (ii)_____, but steadfastly meets unexpected and often unjust hardships...\" The structure here is \"does not [blank], but meets hardships.\" The contrast is between not doing something and instead facing the hardships. So the blank should be a verb that's the opposite of facing them. The options are preserve, improvise, shy away. Shy away means to avoid, which makes sense here. If you don't shy away (avoid) and instead meet them, that's logical. Preserve doesn't fit the context. Improvise might mean to adapt, but the contrast is more about avoidance. So blank (ii) is shy away.\n\nNow blank (iii): \"one masters all obstacles and at the end (iii)_____.\" The result after overcoming obstacles. The options are elicits adversities, emerges victorious, evades achievements. Eliciting adversities would mean causing more problems, which doesn't make sense here. Evades achievements is negative, but the passage is about wish fulfillment and success. Emerging victorious fits perfectly as the positive outcome. So blank (iii) is emerges victorious.\n\nPutting it all together: unavoidable, shy away, emerges victorious. The explanation is that the struggles are unavoidable (intrinsic), one must not avoid (shy away) them, leading to victory.\n</think>\n\nanswer1, answer2, answer3\nunavoidable, shy away, emerges victorious\nExplanation: The passage states struggles are \"an intrinsic part of human existence,\" making \"unavoidable\" logical for (i).

The positive outcome after mastering obstacles aligns with \"emerges victorious\" (iii).",

The writer is presenting two possible conclusions based on the diamonds' characteristics.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the blanks. Let's start with the first two blanks (i) and (ii). The sentence says that because diamonds are both (i) and (ii), they prove one of two conclusions. The two conclusions are that either the buyers have so much money they can spend on goods that (iii), or they're trying to appear wealthy even if they go into debt.\n\nSo, the first two blanks must be qualities of diamonds that lead to these conclusions. Let's look at the options for Blank (i): flawless, fungible, expensive. For Blank (ii): durable, useless, irreplaceable.\n\nThe two conclusions are about either having excess money or wanting to show off. If the diamonds are expensive, that makes sense because spending a lot on them would require money. But what's the second quality? If they're expensive and something else, maybe \"useless\" because then they serve no practical purpose. That would fit with the third blank being \"serve no practical purpose.\" Alternatively, if they're durable, maybe that's a reason they appreciate in value. But the third conclusion's options are about the goods either appreciating, showing connoisseurship, or being impractical.\n\nWait, the third blank is part of the first conclusion: purchasers have so much money they can spend on goods that (iii). If the goods (diamonds) are expensive and useless, then the third blank would be \"serve no practical purpose.\" That makes sense. Because if you have a lot of money, you can afford to buy things that are not useful. Alternatively, if they are expensive and durable, maybe they appreciate in value. But the first conclusion is about having so much money they can spend on something. If the goods serve no purpose, that's a luxury. So maybe (i) is expensive and (ii) is useless. Then (iii) would be \"serve no practical purpose.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the diamonds are fungible (interchangeable) and durable, but I'm not sure. Fungible might mean they can be replaced, but the second blank options include \"irreplaceable,\" which is the opposite. Hmm. Let's think again.\n\nThe two characteristics of diamonds must lead to the two conclusions. The first conclusion is that buyers have so much money they can spend on goods that (iii). The second is that they want others to think they're wealthy, even going into debt. So the two characteristics of diamonds should be such that they are either a good investment (so you can spend on something that appreciates) or a status symbol (so you go into debt to show off). But the passage says \"because they are both (i) and (ii), prove one of two conclusions.\" So the diamonds' attributes must support both possibilities.\n\nWait, the structure is: because diamonds are X and Y, therefore either conclusion A or conclusion B. So X and Y must be qualities that make both conclusions possible. For example, if diamonds are expensive and durable, then maybe they can be seen as an investment (appreciate) or as a status symbol. But the third blank in the first conclusion is about the goods (diamonds) that (iii). So if the first conclusion is that buyers have money to spend on goods that serve no purpose, then (iii) would be \"serve no practical purpose.\" But then the diamonds would need to be both expensive and useless. That makes sense. Because if they're expensive and useless, then buying them either shows you have money to waste (so much that you can spend on useless things) or you're trying to look rich by buying expensive things even if you can't afford them.\n\nSo for Blank (i), \"expensive\" and Blank (ii) \"useless.\" Then Blank (iii) would be \"serve no practical purpose.\" Let's check the options again.\n\nBlank (i) options: expensive is an option. Blank (ii): useless is an option. Then (iii) is \"serve no practical purpose.\" That seems to fit. Because if diamonds are expensive and useless (no practical use), then buying them either shows you have money to burn on non-practical items, or you're faking wealth by going into debt for something that's just for show.\n\nAlternatively, if the diamonds are \"fungible\" (interchangeable, like money) and \"durable,\" maybe they can be a store of value. Then the first conclusion would be that they appreciate in value. But the third blank's option is \"may appreciate in value.\" So if (i) is fungible and (ii) durable, then (iii) could be \"may appreciate.\" But how does that fit the second conclusion? If they're fungible and durable, maybe people buy them as investments. But the second conclusion is about wanting others to think they're wealthy, so they go into debt. That might not directly relate to fungible and durable. Alternatively, expensive and useless makes more sense for the two conclusions. Because expensive implies high cost, and useless implies no practical value. So buying them either shows you have money to waste (because they're expensive and useless) or you're trying to show off (even if you can't afford it, hence debt).\n\nSo the first two blanks would be expensive and useless, leading to the third blank being serve no practical purpose. Let me check the options again. Yes, \"expensive\" is in Blank (i), \"useless\" in Blank (ii), and \"serve no practical purpose\" in Blank (iii). That seems to fit the logic.\n</think>\n\nexpensive, useless, serve no practical purpose\nExplanation: The passage states that diamonds' characteristics lead to two conclusions about buyers. Diamonds being \"expensive\" (Blank i) and \"useless\" (Blank ii) means they have high cost but no practical value. This supports the first conclusion that buyers with excess wealth spend on items that \"serve no practical purpose\" (Blank iii), or the second conclusion that buyers go into debt to feign wealth. The other options (e.g., \"durable,\" \"fungible\") don't align with the contrast between utility and ostentation implied by the conclusions.",

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nFirst blank (i): The sentence says watermills were more (i)_____ than windmills. The next sentence starts with \"It is true that windmills could be built virtually anywhere, whereas watermills (ii)_____.\" So here, the first part after \"It is true\" is presenting a point in favor of windmills (they can be built anywhere), but then the \"whereas\" contrasts with watermills. Then the third sentence says \"However, watermills' greater capacity and reliability provided a better (iii)_____ the money...\" The \"However\" indicates that despite the previous point (windmills being more versatile in location), watermills had advantages that made them more (i) something. \n\nSo for blank (i), the contrast is between windmills being more versatile (since they can be built anywhere) and watermills being more something. But the \"However\" introduces that watermills had greater capacity and reliability, which are positive traits. So the first blank should be a positive adjective. The options are problematic (negative), profitable (positive), versatile (could be positive but maybe not). Since the next part says windmills are more versatile (built anywhere), so watermills are less versatile but more profitable? Because their capacity and reliability give a better return on investment. So blank (i) is probably \"profitable\".\n\nSecond blank (ii): The sentence says windmills could be built anywhere, whereas watermills (ii)_____. The \"whereas\" indicates a contrast. So if windmills are versatile in location, watermills must be limited. So the second blank should be \"were suitable only for certain locations\". The other options: \"inspired new tech\" doesn't contrast location, and \"required upkeep\" is about maintenance, not location. So the answer here is the first option.\n\nThird blank (iii): The sentence says watermills' capacity and reliability provided a better (iii)_____ the money. The phrase \"return on investment\" is common. So \"return on\" makes sense here. \"Source of\" would need a noun after, like \"source of income\", but here it's \"money required to build\", so \"return on\" fits. \"Adjunct to\" means an addition, which doesn't fit. So blank (iii) is \"return on\".\n\nPutting it all together: Blank (i) is profitable, (ii) suitable only for certain locations, (iii) return on. The explanation is that despite windmills being more versatile in location, watermills were more profitable because their advantages gave a better return on investment.\n</think>\n\nprofitable, were suitable only for certain locations, return on\nExplanation: The passage contrasts windmills' versatility (built anywhere) with watermills' limitations (location-dependent), explaining via \"However\" that watermills' superior capacity/reliability justified their cost. Blank (i) requires a positive trait (\"profitable\") to contrast with windmills' flexibility. Blank (ii) logically contrasts \"built anywhere\" with location constraints. Blank (iii) uses \"return on\" to indicate financial justification for investment.",

The first blank (i) needs an adjective describing how Japan's university was compared to China's. The sentence says \"since the Chinese Tang system was highly (ii)_____.\" So there's a cause here. Then later, it says that as Japanese court offices became hereditary, the examination system (iii)____.\n\nStarting with the first blank. The first part says Japan's university was more (i)____ than Chinese ones because the Chinese system was (ii)____. The word \"since\" indicates a reason. So if the Chinese system was highly something, that made Japan's more something else. Let's look at the options for (i): prestigious, egalitarian, profitable. For (ii): aristocratic, reputable, unsystematic.\n\nIf the Chinese system was highly aristocratic (ii), then Japan's might be more egalitarian (i). Because if China's system favored the aristocracy, Japan's might have been more open. That makes sense. Because the next part says that over time, Japanese offices became hereditary, so the exam system (which allowed students from various classes) would decline. So initially, Japan's system was more egalitarian, but when offices became hereditary, the exam system (which was egalitarian) would atrophy. So (i) is egalitarian, (ii) is aristocratic.\n\nThen for (iii), the exam system that admitted a wide range of classes would have atrophied into insignificance because the offices became hereditary. So the system that was based on exams (merit) would become less important. So (iii) is \"atrophied into insignificance.\"\n\nLet me check the flow again. First, Japan's university was more egalitarian than China's because China's system was aristocratic. Then, when Japan's offices became hereditary, the exam system (which allowed social mobility) declined. So the blanks fit: egalitarian, aristocratic, atrophied into insignificance.\n</think>\n\negalitarian, aristocratic, atrophied into insignificance\nExplanation: The passage contrasts Japan's initial university system with China's Tang system. Since the Chinese system was \"highly aristocratic,\" Japan's was more \"egalitarian\" (emphasizing equality). Later, as Japanese offices became hereditary, the merit-based examination system (previously allowing broad admission) logically \"atrophied into insignificance\" due to disuse.

The sentence has three blanks, and I need to figure out the correct options for each.\n\nFirst, I'll read the entire passage carefully. The structure is: the historian's narrative is (i)_____, because though there is nothing (ii)_____ the account, large parts rely on (iii)_____. \n\nThe key word here is \"because,\" which indicates that the reason follows. The sentence is explaining why the narrative is (i). The second part says \"though there is nothing (ii)_____ the account,\" which introduces a contrast. So even though the account doesn't have something, the fact that large parts rely on (iii)_____ makes the narrative (i).\n\nLet's start with Blank (i). The options are diffuse, reasonable, questionable. The sentence is giving a reason why the narrative is a certain way. If the account relies on something unreliable (like conjecture), then the narrative might be questionable. If the account is fully documented, then maybe reasonable. But the structure here is that even though there's nothing wrong in one aspect (ii), the reliance on (iii) makes the narrative (i). So if (iii) is something bad, then (i) would be negative. Let's hold that thought.\n\nBlank (ii): options are psychologically penetrating in, inherently implausible about, fully documented in. The phrase \"though there is nothing (ii)_____ the account\" suggests that the account isn't bad in this aspect. For example, if (ii) is \"inherently implausible about,\" then \"nothing inherently implausible\" would mean the account is plausible. But the contrast is that despite that, the narrative is (i) because parts rely on (iii). So if (ii) is a positive attribute, then the problem is with (iii). Alternatively, if (ii) is neutral or negative. Wait, \"though\" introduces a contrast. So the structure is: the narrative is (i) because, even though there's nothing (ii) the account, large parts rely on (iii). So the (ii) is a positive thing that the account has, but the (iii) is a negative thing that undermines it. So for example, if (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then the account is well-documented, but parts rely on conjecture (which is bad), making the narrative questionable. That makes sense. Alternatively, if (ii) is \"inherently implausible about,\" then \"nothing inherently implausible\" would mean the account is plausible, but if parts rely on conjecture, maybe the narrative is still questionable. Hmm. Let's think.\n\nIf (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then the account is fully documented, but parts are conjecture. That's a contradiction. Wait, no. The sentence says \"though there is nothing (ii) the account, largely parts of it rely on (iii).\" So \"though\" is a contrast. So even though the account is (ii) (positive), parts rely on (iii) (negative), making the narrative (i) (negative). So for example, if (ii) is \"fully documented,\" then the account is fully documented, but parts are conjecture. That's a problem because if parts are conjecture, then the documentation isn't complete. Wait, but the first part says \"nothing (ii) the account.\" So \"nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account isn't fully documented. But the structure is \"though there is nothing (ii) the account,\" which would mean that the account does have (ii). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me parse the sentence again.\n\nThe historian's narrative is (i)_____, because though there is nothing (ii)_____ the account, largely parts of it rely on (iii)_____.\n\nThe \"because\" clause explains why the narrative is (i). The \"though\" introduces a concession. So the structure is: The narrative is (i) because [even though the account has nothing (ii)], [parts rely on (iii)]. So the (ii) is a positive attribute that the account has, but despite that, the reliance on (iii) makes the narrative (i). So (iii) must be a negative thing. Let's look at the options for (iii): plagiarism, conjecture, pretense. Conjecture is speculation, which is not solid evidence. Plagiarism is stealing others' work. Pretense is pretending. So if parts rely on conjecture, that's a weakness. So (iii) is conjecture. Then, (ii) would be something positive. The options for (ii) are: psychologically penetrating (positive), inherently implausible (negative), fully documented (positive). So if (ii) is \"inherently implausible,\" then \"nothing inherently implausible\" would mean the account is plausible. But then, if parts rely on conjecture, the narrative is questionable. That could work. Alternatively, if (ii) is \"fully documented,\" then \"nothing fully documented\" would mean the account isn't fully documented. Wait, the wording is \"there is nothing (ii) the account.\" So if (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account lacks full documentation. But that would conflict with the \"though\" clause. Wait, \"though there is nothing (ii) the account\" — the \"nothing\" here is tricky. Let me think. The phrase \"there is nothing (ii) the account\" would mean that the account does not have (ii). For example, if (ii) is \"inherently implausible about,\" then \"there is nothing inherently implausible about the account\" means the account is plausible. Then, the contrast is that even though the account is plausible (nothing implausible), parts rely on conjecture, making the narrative questionable. That makes sense. Alternatively, if (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account isn't fully documented. But then the \"though\" would be contrasting that with the parts relying on conjecture. But if the account isn't fully documented (nothing fully documented), then relying on conjecture would make sense. But the structure is \"because though there is nothing (ii) the account, parts rely on (iii).\" So the \"though\" is presenting a concession. So the idea is that even though the account has (ii), which is a positive, the reliance on (iii) (negative) makes the narrative (i) (negative). Wait, but if (ii) is \"nothing inherently implausible,\" then the account is plausible. But the parts rely on conjecture, which is not solid, so the narrative is questionable. That works. So (i) is questionable, (ii) is inherently implausible about, (iii) conjecture. Wait, no. If (ii) is \"inherently implausible about,\" then \"nothing inherently implausible about the account\" means the account is plausible. Then, even though it's plausible, parts are conjecture. But why would that make the narrative questionable? Because even though the account as a whole isn't implausible, the parts that are conjecture (unproven) make the narrative questionable. That makes sense. Alternatively, if (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then \"nothing fully documented\" would mean the account isn't fully documented. But then the parts rely on conjecture, which would make the narrative questionable. But the \"though\" would be contrasting the lack of full documentation with the reliance on conjecture. But that's not a strong contrast. Because if the account isn't fully documented, relying on conjecture is expected. The \"though\" suggests that despite a positive aspect, there's a negative. So the positive aspect is that the account is plausible (nothing implausible), but the negative is that parts are conjecture. So (i) is questionable, (ii) is inherently implausible about, (iii) conjecture. Wait, but \"inherently implausible about\" would mean that the account isn't implausible. So the account is plausible, but parts are conjecture. So the narrative is questionable because even though the account isn't implausible, parts are based on guesswork. That works. Alternatively, if (ii) is \"fully documented,\" then \"nothing fully documented\" would mean the account isn't fully documented. But then the parts rely on conjecture. So the narrative is questionable because it's not fully documented and uses conjecture. But the structure is \"though there is nothing (ii) the account,\" which would mean that the account is (ii). Wait, no. The structure is \"there is nothing (ii) the account.\" So if (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" means the account is not fully documented. Then, the \"though\" is saying even though the account isn't fully documented (which is a negative), parts rely on conjecture (another negative). But that's not a contrast. The \"though\" should present a contrast. So the correct structure is: the narrative is questionable because, even though the account has a positive attribute (nothing wrong with it in some way), parts rely on a negative. So (ii) must be a positive attribute. The positive options for (ii) are \"psychologically penetrating\" or \"fully documented.\" \"Inherently implausible\" is negative. So if (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account is not fully documented, which is a negative. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phrasing. The phrase is \"there is nothing (ii) the account.\" So if (ii) is \"inherently implausible about,\" then \"there is nothing inherently implausible about the account\" means the account is plausible. That's a positive. Then, even though the account is plausible (nothing implausible), parts rely on conjecture, making the narrative questionable. That makes sense. So (i) is questionable, (ii) is inherently implausible about, (iii) conjecture. Wait, but \"inherently implausible about\" would be a negative, but the sentence says \"nothing inherently implausible,\" which is a positive. So the account is plausible. Then, the problem is that parts are conjecture. So the narrative is questionable because even though the account isn't implausible, parts are based on guesswork. That works. Alternatively, if (ii) is \"fully documented in,\" then \"there is nothing fully documented in the account\" would mean the account isn't documented, which is a negative, but the \"though\" is supposed to present a positive. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, (ii) must be \"inherently implausible about,\" making the account plausible, but parts are conjecture, leading to the narrative being questionable. So the answers would be: (i) questionable, (ii) inherently implausible about, (iii) conjecture. Let me check the options again. Blank (i) options: diffuse (spread out, not focused), reasonable, questionable. If the narrative uses conjecture, then it's questionable. Yes. So that fits. So the answers are questionable, inherently implausible about, conjecture.\n</think>\n\nquestionable, inherently implausible about, conjecture  \nExplanation: The narrative is \"questionable\" because, despite the account having \"nothing inherently implausible\" (i.e., it seems plausible), large parts rely on \"conjecture\" (speculation), which undermines its credibility. The contrast introduced by \"though\" highlights that while the account isn’t implausible, its reliance on unproven elements makes the narrative doubtful.",

The next part says that the Galaxy Zoo team was inspired to pursue new research because of something related to the volunteers.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The volunteers are described as \"zealous,\" which means enthusiastic. The result of their action is that they classified the catalog years early. So, how did this affect the organizers? The options are \"beguiled\" (charmed/tricked), \"forestalled\" (prevented), or \"astonished\" (surprised). Since the volunteers completed the task much faster than expected, the organizers would be surprised. So \"astonished\" makes sense here.\n\nBlank (ii): The next sentence starts with a word here. The team was inspired because of the volunteers' something. The options are Baffled (confused), Buoyed (uplifted/supported), or Embarrassed. If the volunteers' action inspired them, then \"Buoyed\" fits because it means being encouraged or uplifted.

So the nation didn't exist yet when he was born, so calling him a foreigner is wrong.\n\nThen the second sentence starts with \"It is true that Hamilton came to believe that he was a (i)_____ the United States...\" So whatever he came to believe about himself. The options are symbol of, stranger in, citizen of. Wait, the first part of the passage says that labeling him a foreigner is anachronistic. But here, the sentence starts with \"It is true that...\" so maybe there's a contrast. Like, even though he wasn't a foreigner in the anachronistic sense, he felt like a stranger. Because the next part says his (ii)_____ was stemmed not from his (iii)_____ but from his confrontation with American democracy. So the reason for blank ii is not because of blank iii, but because of his issues with democracy.\n\nSo blank (i): If he felt like a stranger in the US, that would make sense. Because even though he wasn't technically a foreigner (as per the first sentence), he came to feel like a stranger. Then blank (ii) would be alienation, since feeling like a stranger leads to alienation. And blank (iii) would be birthplace, because the first part of the passage was about birthplace not being a valid reason.

Blank (i) options: symbol of, stranger in, citizen of. If he felt like a stranger in the US, that fits. Then blank (ii) is alienation, which makes sense.

However, Hamilton's own feeling of being a \"stranger in\" the U.S. (Blank i) arises from his \"alienation\" (Blank ii), which stems not from his \"birthplace\" (Blank iii, directly refuting the initial flawed assumption) but from his critique of American democracy.

The first blank is in the first part: \"Friedlander (i)_____ places that most people consider ugly\". The options are \"tends to avoid\", \"is harshly critical of\", or \"is interested in\".\n\nThe sentence starts with \"Just because... does not mean he is out to prove they are beautiful.\" So the structure here is that even though he does something with these ugly places, it's not to show they're beautiful. So the first blank should be something he does with the ugly places. If the common view is that they're ugly, and he's not trying to prove they're beautiful, maybe he's photographing them. So \"is interested in\" makes sense here. Because if he's interested in photographing them, but that doesn't mean he's trying to make them look beautiful. If he avoided them, then the rest of the sentence wouldn't make sense. So blank (i) is probably \"is interested in\".\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"the photographer simply cannot ignore so much of the built American landscape but is obligated to (ii)_____ what we pass through day in and day out\". The word \"but\" here suggests a contrast. Instead of ignoring, he's obligated to do something. The options are document, emulate, discredit. Documenting makes sense here because photographers often document things. Emulate would mean copying, which doesn't fit. Discredit is negative, but the first part says he's not trying to prove they're ugly. So \"document\" fits here. He's not ignoring, so he must record or document them.\n\nThird blank: \"regardless of (iii)_____\". The options are authenticity, truthfulness, aesthetics. The sentence is talking about places people consider ugly, so aesthetics relates to beauty. The idea is that he documents these places no matter their aesthetic value. So regardless of aesthetics.

They concluded that reserving up to an hour a day for something in school curricula doesn't negatively affect academic achievement. In fact, more exercise often does something positive to school performance, even though it takes time away from core subjects.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first blank. The options are physical activity, leisure time, open study. The context is about reserving time in school curricula. Since the passage later mentions \"more exercise,\" which relates to physical activity, that's probably the first blank. Leisure time is too vague, and open study doesn't fit with the exercise connection. So Blank (i) is physical activity.\n\nNext, Blank (ii). The sentence says that reserving time for physical activity does not ____ academic achievement. The next sentence starts with \"In fact, they noted that more exercise often...\" which implies a contrast or continuation. The second part says despite taking time away from studies, performance is better. So the first part must mean that the time for exercise doesn't harm academic achievement. The options are contribute to, detract from, correlate with. \"Detract from\" means to reduce or harm, so the conclusion is that it doesn't detract from academic achievement. So Blank (ii) is detract from.\n\nNow Blank (iii). The third part says more exercise often ____ school performance. Since despite taking time away, the effect is positive. So the verb here should be positive. The options are diminished, augmented, counteracted. Augmented means increased or improved, so that fits.

                "model_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this GRE Text Completion question. The passage is about how using metaphors from battle and sports affects the argumentative process. The three blanks need to be filled with the correct words from the options given.\n\nFirst, I'll read the entire passage carefully. The main idea is that using these metaphors might contribute to something (Blank i) in the argumentative process. Then, these metaphors may do something (Blank ii) to adversarial conceptions, leading people to act aggressively. This aggression then does something (Blank iii) to the process that should lead to resolution.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The sentence says that using battle/sports metaphors \"contributes to the (i)____________ of the argumentative process.\" The options are analysis, proliferation, breakdown. If the metaphors are making people more adversarial, maybe they're causing a negative effect. \"Breakdown\" makes sense here because if arguments become too aggressive, the process might break down instead of working properly. \"Proliferation\" would mean spreading, but the process itself isn't spreading. \"Analysis\" doesn't fit the negative context. So Blank (i) is probably \"breakdown.\"\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The metaphors may (ii) adversarial conceptions. The options are distort, retard, promote. If the metaphors are leading people to behave aggressively, then they might be promoting or encouraging adversarial ideas. \"Promote\" fits here. \"Distort\" could mean twisting the conceptions, but the sentence is about causing them, not misrepresenting. \"Retard\" would mean slowing, which doesn't fit. So Blank (ii) is \"promote.\"\n\nNow Blank (iii): The aggressive behavior is thereby (iii) a process that should lead to resolution. The options are presaging, simulating, undermining. If the process is supposed to lead to resolution but people are aggressive, then they're hindering it. \"Undermining\" means weakening or subverting, which fits. \"Presaging\" means predicting, which doesn't make sense. \"Simulating\" would mean imitating, which isn't right here. So Blank (iii) is \"undermining.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The use of metaphors contributes to the breakdown (i) of the process. The metaphors promote (ii) adversarial ideas, leading to aggression, thereby undermining (iii) the resolution process. The logical flow is that negative metaphors lead to negative outcomes in arguments.\n</think>\n\nbreakdown, promote, undermining\nExplanation: The passage argues that battle/sports metaphors negatively affect arguments. These metaphors promote adversarial views (Blank ii), causing aggression which leads to the process's breakdown (Blank i) and undermines (Blank iii) resolution. \"Breakdown\" fits as the process fails; \"promote\" suggests encouraging adversarial ideas; \"undermining\" indicates weakening the ideal outcome.",

So, the passage is about the Agriculture Department releasing dietary guidelines and the consequences if people don't follow them. The blanks are in three parts. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, Blank (i): The options are \"make public,\" \"debunked,\" or \"refused to consider.\" The sentence says when the department did something with the guidelines, they laid down a challenge. So, the department probably released or published the guidelines. \"Make public\" makes sense here. \"Debunked\" would mean they disproved them, which doesn't fit because they're setting a challenge. \"Refused to consider\" also doesn't fit because the guidelines are being presented. So Blank (i) is probably \"make public.\"\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The options are \"intangibles,\" \"misconceptions,\" or \"maladies.\" The \"or else\" refers to negative consequences. The list includes heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes. These are all diseases. So \"maladies\" (which means diseases) fits here. \"Intangibles\" are things you can't touch, which doesn't fit. \"Misconceptions\" are wrong ideas, but the context is about health problems, not ideas. So Blank (ii) is \"maladies.\"\n\nThen, Blank (iii): Options are \"assuage,\" \"plague,\" or \"ignore.\" The sentence says these maladies do something to the developed world. The verb should mean something like \"afflict\" or \"trouble.\" \"Plague\" as a verb means to cause continual trouble, which fits. \"Assuage\" means to lessen, which is the opposite. \"Ignore\" doesn't make sense because the diseases are affecting the world. So Blank (iii) is \"plague.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The Agriculture Department made public the guidelines, warning of maladies that plague the developed world. That makes sense. Let me check again. The guidelines challenge people to eat better, or else face these diseases. Yes, the choices fit logically and grammatically.\n</think>\n\nmake public, maladies, plague\nExplanation: The Agriculture Department \"made public\" guidelines to challenge eating habits. The \"or else\" refers to negative health consequences, so \"maladies\" (diseases) like those listed. These diseases \"plague\" (afflict) the developed world, fitting the context of widespread problems.",

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nFirst blank (i): \"Governments tend to be (i)____________ the Internet.\" The next sentences say most are truly (ii)____________ its growth and opportunities. Then they mention that countries trying to hold it back look foolish. But then (iii)____________, they find the Internet's culture and border contempt subversive and terrifying.\n\nSo, the first blank needs a word that captures a mixed feeling. Because the following sentences talk about positive aspects (excited by growth, opportunities) but then switch to negative (subversive, terrifying). So the government has conflicting feelings. Ambivalent about would fit here. Because ambivalent means having mixed feelings. Indifferent doesn't make sense because they do care. Overly optimistic would only cover the positive, but the third part is negative. So Blank (i) is ambivalent about.\n\nSecond blank (ii): \"Most are truly (ii)____________ its growth and opportunities.\" The word \"truly\" here. If they are ambivalent, then they have both positive and negative. The next part says they sense that holding back the Internet makes them look foolish. So they probably recognize the growth and opportunities. So excited by makes sense here. Because if they are excited by the opportunities, they don't want to hold it back. Anxious about would be negative, but the context here is positive. Unaware of doesn't fit because they do recognize the opportunities. So Blank (ii) is excited by.\n\nThird blank (iii): The transition here. The previous sentences talk about positive aspects (excited, opportunities, not wanting to look bad). Then the next part says they find the Internet's culture terrifying. So there's a contrast. The transition word should indicate a contrast. \"At the same time\" is used to present a contrasting idea that coexists. Moreover would add another similar point, but here it's a contrast. Consequently would show a result, but the two ideas are opposing. So Blank (iii) is At the same time.\n\nPutting it all together: Governments are ambivalent (mixed feelings), excited by the growth, but at the same time find the culture terrifying. That makes sense.

The first part says that philosophers of science originally thought of experimental findings as fixed, and theories were built on that data. But then sociologists have shown something different. The first blank (i) needs a word that contrasts with the initial view of theories being built on fixed data. The original idea was one-sided, maybe? So the sociologists are saying it's not so one-sided. So blank (i) could be \"less one-sided\".\n\nMoving to blank (ii). The sentence says empirical data may be as [blank] as theories. The example given is that a well-confirmed theory can reduce the [blank (iii)] of conflicting data, just like unexpected data can question a theory. So theories can be challenged, and data can be challenged too. So the data isn't fixed. The word for (ii) should mean something like \"open to question\" or \"debatable\". Looking at options: hypothetical is more like not proven, disputable means can be argued against, consequential means important. So disputable fits here. So (ii) is disputable.\n\nThen blank (iii). A theory with strong prior confirmation may reduce the [blank] of conflicting findings. If the theory is strong, people might doubt the new finding. So the credibility (how believable it is) of the finding is reduced. So (iii) is credibility.

The first sentence says that political ads have remained similar since the 1950s, while consumer ads have changed a lot. So the difference must be in what each type of advertiser values.\n\nLooking at the first blank (i), consumer advertisers prize something that leads to change. The opposite of sticking to the same old ways. So if consumer ads have evolved, they probably value originality. That makes sense because originality would drive innovation and change. So blank (i) is likely \"originality\".\n\nThen, the second blank (ii) is what political advertisers prize. Since their ads haven't changed much, they must value something that resists change. The options here are earnestness, conformity, or persuasion. Conformity fits because it means following established norms, which would lead to less change. Political ads sticking to tradition would align with conformity. So blank (ii) is \"conformity\".\n\nThe third blank (iii) talks about the kind of change political ads are resistant to, except for the most what change. The sentence says they're resistant to all but the most something change. If they don't change much, the change that does happen must be small or gradual. \"Incremental\" means happening in small steps, so that fits.

Then there's a claim that these differences are (ii)_____, or that everyone acts only in their own self-interest. This claim (iii)_____ everyday observations and moral evaluation practices.\n\nFirst, let's break down each blank. For blank (i), the options are altruistic, adaptable, disciplined. The sentence starts with \"common sense tells me some people are more...\" So the author is contrasting this with the claim that differences are something else. The claim says that deep down, everyone acts to further their own interests. So if the claim is that everyone is self-interested, then the common sense view must be that some are more selfless. So blank (i) should be altruistic. Because altruistic means selfless, which is the opposite of self-interest. That makes sense.\n\nMoving to blank (ii). The claim is that these differences (in altruism) are either growing, illusory, or relevant. The claim is presented as opposing the common sense view. If the common sense says differences exist (some more altruistic), the claim would say those differences aren't real. So \"illusory\" fits here. Because if the differences are illusory, they don't really exist, which aligns with the idea that everyone is actually self-interested. So blank (ii) is illusory.\n\nNow blank (iii). The claim that differences are illusory (or that everyone is self-interested) does what to everyday observations and moral evaluations? The author is probably saying that this claim goes against common sense. So the verb here should be contradicts. Because if the claim says everyone is self-interested, but common sense observes that some are altruistic, then the claim contradicts those observations. So blank (iii) is contradicts.\n\nLet me check again. The structure is: Common sense says some are more altruistic. The claim says differences are illusory (so they aren't real), and that everyone is self-interested. This claim contradicts (goes against) everyday observations and moral practices. That makes sense. The other options for (iii) are mimics or explains. If the claim explained the observations, that would mean it aligns with them, but the author is arguing against the claim, so contradicts is better. Yeah, that's right.\n</think>\n\naltruistic, illusory, contradicts\nExplanation: The passage contrasts common sense (some people are more altruistic) with a claim that such differences are illusory (not real) and everyone is self-interested. This claim contradicts observations and moral evaluations, as altruism would oppose pure self-interest. \"Altruistic\" fits (i), \"illusory\" negates real differences in (ii), and \"contradicts\" shows opposition in (iii).",

The first blank is in a sentence talking about policies aimed at limiting population growth. The transition word here is \"nevertheless,\" which signals a contrast. So even though these policies have been something, the country's size and isolation mean that human populations in certain areas do something else.\n\nFor Blank (i), the options are modified, deemphasized, or implemented. The sentence starts by saying that the policies have been [blank], but despite that (nevertheless), the human populations in remote areas... So if the policies are meant to limit growth, if they've been implemented, that would be a positive step. But the \"nevertheless\" suggests that even with this implementation, there's a problem. So implemented makes sense here. If the policies were deemphasized, that would mean they're not being focused on, but the sentence structure implies that the policies are in place but not effective everywhere.\n\nMoving to Blank (ii), the options are could start to decline, can grow unchecked, or have stabilized. The reason given is the country's vast size and isolation of regions. So in areas where large carnivores are, maybe the policies aren't effective. If the policies are implemented (as per Blank i), but in remote areas, people can still grow unchecked. That would explain why human pressure is a problem. So \"can grow unchecked\" fits here. If they could start to decline, that would be a positive, but the context is about the threat, so negative outcome. Have stabilized would mean no growth, but the passage says human pressure is a problem, so growth is still happening there.\n\nBlank (iii) options are celebrated, doomed, or bypassed. The human pressure has [blank] the South China tiger. Since the main threat is population growth leading to human pressure, the tigers are likely negatively affected. \"Doomed\" makes sense here, meaning they're destined to die out. Celebrated is positive, which doesn't fit. Bypassed would mean the tigers were avoided, but the context is about threat leading to their demise.\n\nPutting it all together: Policies implemented (i), but in remote areas, populations can grow unchecked (ii), leading to the tigers being doomed (iii).

The first blank is in the first sentence: \"The usual (i)_____ spending public monies on scientific projects is that such projects have the potential to make our lives healthier, safer, and more productive.\" So, the structure here is that the first part is giving a reason for spending money. The word \"usual\" suggests it's a common argument. The options for blank (i) are \"argument against,\" \"rationale for,\" or \"precedent for.\" Since the reason given is positive (healthier, safer, etc.), the blank should be a positive reason. \"Rationale for\" makes sense here because a rationale is a reason or justification. \"Argument against\" would be negative, which doesn't fit. \"Precedent for\" is about prior examples, but the sentence is about the reason, not examples. So blank (i) is probably \"rationale for.\"\n\nNext, the second blank: \"However, the fact that science... can strengthen democracy... is hardly ever (ii)_____.\" The \"however\" indicates a contrast. The first part was the usual reason (health benefits), but this other benefit (democracy) is not often something. The options are \"denied,\" \"mentioned,\" or \"gainsaid.\" \"Gainsaid\" means contradicted or denied. If the usual reason is given, but the democracy aspect is not often brought up, then \"mentioned\" could fit. But \"hardly ever gainsaid\" would mean it's rarely denied. Wait, the sentence structure: \"the fact that... can strengthen democracy... is hardly ever (ii).\" If the fact is true, then if it's \"hardly ever gainsaid,\" that would mean people don't deny it. But the author is pointing out that this benefit is overlooked. So maybe the author is saying that this point is not often mentioned. So \"mentioned\" would be the opposite. Wait, \"hardly ever mentioned\" would mean it's rarely talked about. That makes sense because the author is introducing this as an additional benefit that's not usually considered. So blank (ii) is \"mentioned\"? Or \"gainsaid\"? Let me think. If the author is saying that even though science can help democracy, this fact is hardly ever [something]. If it's \"gainsaid,\" then it's not denied, which would mean people accept it. But the author is trying to say that this benefit is not usually considered. So \"mentioned\" would fit better. Because the usual rationale is the health benefits, but the democracy part is not often mentioned. So blank (ii) is \"mentioned.\" Wait, but \"gainsaid\" is a less common word. \"Hardly ever gainsaid\" would mean it's almost never denied. But the author's point is that this benefit is overlooked, not that it's accepted. So maybe \"mentioned\" is correct.\n\nThird blank: \"It should be Scientific literacy (iii)_____ democracy, and this is an important ancillary benefit...\" The author is saying that scientific literacy does something positive to democracy. The options are \"stifles,\" \"energizes,\" \"disregards.\" Clearly, \"energizes\" is positive. The sentence is saying that promoting science has this ancillary benefit of helping democracy. So scientific literacy should energize democracy. So blank (iii) is \"energizes.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The first blank is \"rationale for\" because it's the reason given for spending. The second blank is \"mentioned\" because the democracy point isn't often brought up. Third is \"energizes.\" Wait, but let me check again. For the second blank, \"gainsaid\" is a possible option. If the author is saying that the fact that science strengthens democracy is hardly ever gainsaid (i.e., not denied), but the author is pointing it out as an important point. Wait, but the sentence after says \"It should be...\" which suggests that the author is emphasizing this point. If the fact is not denied (gainsaid), then why is the author bringing it up? Maybe the author is saying that even though this benefit exists, people don't talk about it. So \"hardly ever mentioned\" makes sense. Because the usual rationale is the health benefits, but the democracy part is not mentioned. So the correct answers would be rationale for, mentioned, energizes. But wait, \"gainsaid\" is a tricky word. Let me check the exact meaning. \"Gainsay\" means to deny or contradict. So \"hardly ever gainsaid\" would mean that people don't deny it. But the author is introducing this as a point that's not considered. So if it's not denied, but also not mentioned, which is the case here. The author is pointing out that this benefit (strengthening democracy) is an important point that's not usually part of the discussion. So the second blank is about whether it's mentioned or denied. The sentence says \"the fact... can strengthen democracy... is hardly ever (ii)\". If the fact is true, but people don't mention it, then \"mentioned\" is correct. If they don't deny it, then \"gainsaid\" would mean they accept it. But the author's point is that this benefit is overlooked, not that it's accepted. So \"mentioned\" is better. Therefore, the answers are rationale for, mentioned, energizes. Wait, but the third blank: \"It should be Scientific literacy (iii)_____ democracy...\" The \"should be\" suggests that the author is making a normative statement. So scientific literacy should do something positive. \"Energizes\" fits here. So the three answers are rationale for, mentioned, energizes. But wait, let me check again. The second blank: \"However, the fact that science... can strengthen democracy... is hardly ever (ii)_____.\" The \"however\" contrasts with the usual rationale. The usual reason is given, but the democracy aspect is not often brought up. So \"mentioned\" is correct. So the answers are: rationale for, mentioned, energizes. But wait, another thought: \"gainsaid\" is a more formal term. If the author is saying that even though people don't deny that science can strengthen democracy, they don't use it as a rationale. But the sentence structure is \"the fact... is hardly ever (ii)\". If the fact is not denied (gainsaid), then it's accepted but not used. But the author is pointing out that this is an important benefit. So maybe \"gainsaid\" is possible. Hmm. Let me think again. The first part says the usual rationale is health benefits. The second part says \"However, the fact that science can strengthen democracy is hardly ever (ii)\". The \"however\" suggests that the author is introducing a contrasting point. If the usual rationale is given, but the democracy point is not mentioned, then the author is adding a new point. So \"mentioned\" makes sense. If it's \"gainsaid,\" then the author is saying that people don't deny it, but they don't use it as a rationale. But the author's point is that this benefit is an important one that should be considered. So maybe \"mentioned\" is better. Because if it's not mentioned, then it's not part of the discussion. So the correct answers are: rationale for, mentioned, energizes. But I'm a bit confused between \"mentioned\" and \"gainsaid\" for the second blank. Let me check the exact wording. The sentence says \"the fact that... can strengthen democracy... is hardly ever (ii)\". If the fact is true, but people don't mention it, then \"mentioned\" is correct. If they don't deny it, then \"gainsaid\" is correct. The author's point is that this benefit is an ancillary one that's not part of the usual rationale. So the fact is not often mentioned. Therefore, \"mentioned\" is the right choice. So the answers are: rationale for, mentioned, energizes.\n</think>\n\nrationale for, mentioned, energizes\nExplanation: The first blank requires a term indicating the reason for spending, so \"rationale for\" fits. The second blank contrasts with the usual argument, suggesting the democracy benefit is rarely discussed, hence \"mentioned.\" The third blank needs a positive effect of scientific literacy on democracy, so \"energizes\" is correct.",

The passage is about early natural scientists developing methods to remove distortions in their research. The key here is understanding how the methods relate to the researcher's subjectivity.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure: the methods were meant to remove distortions caused by the environment or the researcher. The sentence continues, focusing on the researcher. The methods, especially regarding the researcher, were thought to do something to those \"something subjectivity.\" The unbridled expression of that subjectivity would do something to the research.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The methods are supposed to remove distortions. If the distortion comes from the researcher's subjectivity, then the methods would aim to control or limit that. The options are restrain, reveal, disguise. \"Restrain\" makes sense here because they want to hold back the subjectivity that could cause distortions. Reveal or disguise don't fit because revealing wouldn't remove distortions, and disguise might hide but not necessarily prevent the negative effect.\n\nBlank (ii): The phrase \"those _____ subjectivity\" needs a noun phrase. The methods are restraining something related to subjectivity. If the subjectivity's expression is unbridled (uncontrolled), then the methods are targeting the incursions (intrusions) of subjectivity. \"Incursions of\" fits here as unwanted entries. Restrictions on subjectivity would be the opposite, since the methods are trying to restrict it. Acknowledgements of subjectivity don't make sense in this context of removing distortions.\n\nBlank (iii): The unbridled expression of subjectivity would have a negative effect on research. The options are corrupt, justification, expedite. Corrupt is the obvious choice here, meaning to spoil or taint the research. Expedite would mean speed up, which isn't negative. Justification doesn't fit as a verb here; the verb form would be 'justify,' but the blank needs a verb in base form. So \"corrupt\" is correct.\n\nPutting it all together: The methods restrain the incursions of subjectivity, whose unbridled expression would corrupt research. That makes sense logically and grammatically.\n</think>\n\nrestrain, incursions of, corrupt\nExplanation: The methods aimed to control the researcher's subjectivity. \"Restrain\" fits Blank (i) as it means limiting subjectivity. \"Incursions of\" (intrusions) in Blank (ii) aligns with unwanted subjectivity. Uncontrolled subjectivity would \"corrupt\" (harm) research, making Blank (iii) correct.",

Then the conclusion is that a lack of flexibility in some plans might be a (ii)____. People (iii)_____ some advantages for peace of mind.\n\nStarting with Blank (i). The first sentence says that a (i)_____ of choices can be paralyzing. Schwartz's book title is \"The Paradox of Choice,\" which suggests that more choices aren't always better. The example supports this by showing that more options lead to less participation. So the blank should mean an excess or too many. The options are surfeit, reduction, stabilization. \"Surfeit\" means an excessive amount, which fits. Reduction would mean fewer, which contradicts the example. Stabilization doesn't make sense here. So Blank (i) is surfeit.\n\nNext, Blank (ii). The sentence says that a lack of flexibility in plans may be a (ii)____. Since the previous part says that more choices are bad, less flexibility (fewer choices) might actually be good. So the blank should be a positive term. The options are virtue, conundrum, revelation. \"Virtue\" makes sense here as a positive quality. Conundrum is a puzzle or problem, which is negative. Revelation is a discovery, which doesn't fit as well. So Blank (ii) is virtue.\n\nNow Blank (iii). The last sentence: People reasonably (iii)_____ some advantages in exchange for peace of mind. They are giving up some benefits (advantages) to get peace of mind. The options are foresee, forestall, forgo. \"Forgo\" means to give up or do without, which fits. Foresee is to predict, which doesn't fit. Forestall means to prevent, which isn't quite right. So Blank (iii) is forgo.\n\nPutting it all together: surfeit, virtue, forgo. The explanation is that having too many choices (surfeit) is bad, so lack of flexibility is a good thing (virtue), and people give up (forgo) some advantages for peace of mind.\n</think>\n\nsurfeit, virtue, forgo\nExplanation: The passage discusses how too many choices (a \"surfeit\") can be overwhelming, leading to the idea that limited flexibility in plans is a positive trait (\"virtue\").

The passage is about political events in different countries during the nineteenth century compared to the present. The structure seems to be a contrast between then and now.\n\nFirst, looking at the first blank: \"Although political events in different countries were not (i)_____ in the nineteenth century...\" The word \"Although\" sets up a contrast. The second part of the sentence talks about their interrelationship being something compared to now when interdependence is greater. So, the first part should suggest that events were connected, but maybe not as much as now. The options for blank (i) are unconnected, trivial, simultaneous. If the first blank is \"unconnected,\" then the sentence would read \"Although they were not unconnected,\" meaning they were connected. That makes sense because the interrelationship was something (maybe less than now). Alternatively, \"simultaneous\" might mean events happened at the same time, but that doesn't directly relate to interrelationship. \"Trivial\" doesn't fit here. So probably blank (i) is \"unconnected.\"\n\nMoving to blank (ii): \"their interrelationship was (ii)_____ compared with the present, when interdependence has become far greater.\" Since now interdependence is greater, back then the interrelationship was less. The options are conditional, superficial, transparent. \"Superficial\" means on the surface, not deep, which contrasts with greater interdependence now. \"Transparent\" would mean clear, which doesn't fit the contrast. \"Conditional\" also doesn't fit. So blank (ii) is \"superficial.\"\n\nBlank (iii): \"has ceased to be an option.\" The colon here indicates that the third part explains the result of the increased interdependence. The options are isolationism, resilience, idealism. If interdependence is greater now, then countries can't choose to isolate themselves. So \"isolationism\" makes sense. \"Resilience\" or \"idealism\" don't directly relate to interdependence. So blank (iii) is \"isolationism.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The first blank is \"unconnected\" (since they were connected but not as much as now), the second is \"superficial\" (their relationships were not deep), and the third is \"isolationism\" (can't isolate anymore).\n</think>\n\nunconnected, superficial, isolationism\nExplanation: The passage contrasts 19th-century political events with today's greater interdependence. \"Although... not unconnected\" implies some connection existed, contrasting with \"superficial\" interrelationships (less deep than today's).

Then it says photography (ii)_____ modern arts, but when used as a tracing tool to (iii)_____ the difficulties of achieving correct proportion, the art feels static and lifeless.\n\nSo, the first blank needs an adjective that describes the quality resulting from using photography as a shortcut. The result is static and lifeless, so the first blank should be something negative. The options are inert, jubilant, sensuous. Inert means lacking energy, which fits with static and lifeless. Jubilant is happy, which doesn't fit. Sensuous is about the senses, maybe positive. So inert for (i).\n\nNext, the second blank: Photography (ii)_____ modern arts. The conjunction here is \"but\", so there's a contrast. The first part might be positive, and the second part (after \"but\") is negative. So maybe photography has a positive effect overall, but when used as a tracing tool, it's bad. The options are \"frequent enervated\" (enervated means weakened), \"wonderfully enriched\", \"inevitably circumscribed\" (limited). If the first part is positive, then \"wonderfully enriched\" makes sense. So (ii) is wonderfully enriched.\n\nThird blank: used as a tracing tool to (iii)_____ the difficulties. The purpose here is to avoid the difficulties. The options are augment (increase), foreground (highlight), circumvent (avoid). So circumvent is the right choice.

The options are proselytizer, sage, or master. Proselytizer is someone who converts others, which might not fit here. Sage is a wise person, and master implies great skill.

The options here are deliberation, enthusiasm, flamboyance. The sentence continues that the reader relaxes knowing hints in chapter 1 will be (iii)_____ by the end. So, the third blank needs something like \"resolved\" or \"explained.\" The options are given import, largely forgotten, overwhelmed. \"Given import\" makes sense because the hints become important. \n\nLooking back at the second blank, the words \"great skill and _____\" need a positive trait that complements skill. Deliberation means careful consideration, which fits with planning the hints. Enthusiasm is more about energy, and flamboyance is showiness.

The second part mentions that none of the techniques would be (ii)_____ anyone interested in music or films. Then it says the techniques would seem strange only to people expecting traditional plays. Finally, the actors think critics' derisive comments show the critics (iii)_____ their work.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The first part describes the performances as dense, unpredictable, hard to digest. So the performances must be challenging for the audience. The options are \"made demands on\", \"had to command\", \"were sure to please\". \"Made demands on\" fits here because if something is hard to digest, it requires effort from the audience. \"Were sure to please\" contradicts the negative traits mentioned. \"Had to command\" might imply they needed to control the audience, which doesn't fit as well. So Blank (i) is likely \"made demands on\".\n\nBlank (ii): The sentence says the techniques wouldn't be (ii)_____ anyone interested in music or films. The next sentence says they'd seem strange only to those expecting traditional plays. So if you're into music or films, the techniques wouldn't be strange. The options are \"contemplated by\", \"alien to\", \"intuitive for\". \"Alien to\" means unfamiliar or foreign. So the techniques wouldn't be alien (unfamiliar) to people with those interests. That makes sense. \"Intuitive for\" might mean they naturally understand, but the context is about whether the techniques are strange. So Blank (ii) is \"alien to\".\n\nBlank (iii): The actors think critics' negative comments show the critics (iii)_____ their work. If the critics didn't understand the work (since the techniques are only strange to traditionalists), then the derisive comments would be based on misunderstanding. The options are \"lambasted\" (criticized harshly), \"exploited\", \"misunderstood\". The key is that the critics didn't get it. So the actors believe the critics misunderstood their work.

The second blank needs a term meaning unfamiliar, but \"alien to\" is negated, implying the techniques are accessible to those with music/film interests. The third blank reflects critics' lack of understanding, hence \"misunderstood\".",

Erudite means scholarly, so the second adjective should be a positive trait that's paired with erudite, but the opposite of lively and readable. So maybe authoritative? Because authoritative and erudite go together, but they might not be lively. Animated and trendy are more about being lively or modern, which are the opposite of what's needed here. So blank (ii) is authoritative.\n\nThird blank: (iii)_____, accompanied by aversion to risk taking, has pervaded its pages. The phrase \"accompanied by aversion to risk\" suggests that the blank is something negative, similar to being risk-averse. Staleness would mean lack of freshness, which makes sense if they're not taking risks. Originality would be the opposite, and impulsiveness is about acting without thinking, which isn't related to risk aversion. So blank (iii) is staleness.\n</think>\n\nlucrative, authoritative, staleness\nExplanation: The first blank contrasts with journals that \"drain money,\" so \"lucrative\" (profitable) fits. The second blank pairs with \"erudite\" and contrasts with \"lively,\" making \"authoritative\" appropriate. The third blank aligns with \"aversion to risk taking,\" indicating a lack of innovation, hence \"staleness.\"",

The passage is about how cultures influence attitudes and beliefs, possibly without people being aware. The key here is to figure out the relationships between the blanks and the context clues.\n\nStarting with the first blank: \"Cultures can shape attitudes and beliefs in ways that (i)_____ conscious awareness or control.\" The next part says \"cultural orientations may develop from processes that do not entail (ii)_____ participation,\" so there's a parallel here. The first blank should indicate that the shaping happens without conscious awareness. The phrase \"operate outside of\" makes sense here because it means the processes are beyond one's conscious control. The other options, \"tend to facilitate\" would mean they help awareness, which contradicts the later part. \"May not alter\" doesn't fit the context of operating without awareness.\n\nFor the second blank: \"processes that do not entail (ii)_____ participation.\" The idea is that people aren't actively involved. So \"active\" participation is the opposite here. If the processes don't require active participation, that aligns with the idea of implicit processes. \"Random\" or \"rote\" don't fit as well because the contrast is about being active versus passive.\n\nThird blank: \"cultures may pervade subtle psychological dynamics in ways that individuals may not be able to (iii)_____.\" If they can't perceive or report these influences, then \"report\" fits. They can't articulate or report something they're not aware of. \"Maintain\" or \"condone\" don't make sense here. The sentence is about awareness, so reporting is the right choice.\n\nPutting it all together: operate outside of, active, report.

Blank (iii) aligns with the inability to articulate unconscious dynamics (\"report\"). The logic flows through implicit cognition themes.",

The passage is about how publishers, publicists, and broadcasters love anniversaries because they turn historical events into something that fits into a culture of celebration. The blanks need to be filled in a way that makes sense with the overall message.\n\nStarting with the first blank: \"those occasions when historical events become (i)_____ in (ii)_____ culture of celebration.\" The key here is that these groups (publishers, etc.) love anniversaries because they can market them. So the first blank should relate to something that can be sold or marketed. Looking at the options for Blank (i), \"marketable artifacts\" makes sense because artifacts can be items that are marketed. \"Elusive moments\" and \"raging controversies\" don't fit as well because the context is about turning events into something usable for celebration, which is more about selling than controversy or being hard to grasp.\n\nNext, Blank (ii) is about the type of culture. Since the sentence mentions \"manufacture a mythical past\" and \"public consumption\" later, the culture here is likely commercial. So \"a commercial\" culture fits because it's about creating something for profit or mass appeal. \"Authentic\" would contradict the idea of manufacturing a myth, and \"elitist\" doesn't align with the public or commercial aspect.\n\nFor Blank (iii), the sentence ends with \"serviceable for public (iii)_____.\" The previous part talks about manufacturing a myth, which is meant to be consumed by the public. \"Consumption\" is the best fit here. \"Scrutiny\" or \"censure\" would imply criticism, which doesn't match the positive context of celebration and patriotic sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together: Marketable artifacts in a commercial culture for public consumption. The explanation ties into how anniversaries are packaged and sold to the public as part of a commercialized celebration, creating a myth that serves public consumption.\n</think>\n\nmarketable artifacts, a commercial, consumption  \nExplanation: The passage discusses how anniversaries are exploited by media and businesses. \"Marketable artifacts\" (Blank i) aligns with turning historical events into sellable products. \"Commercial culture\" (Blank ii) reflects the profit-driven nature of these celebrations. \"Consumption\" (Blank iii) fits the idea of packaging history for public use, contrasting with scrutiny or censure, which imply criticism.",

                "model_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this GRE Text Completion question. The passage is about intellectual property laws and their impact on creativity. The structure seems to have a contrast between two scenarios: one where certain creative works are affected by uncontrolled copying, leading to a decision about the law, and another where unprotected work does something even without legal rules.\n\nFirst, looking at the first blank. The sentence starts by saying that laws are meant to stimulate creativity, but some forms never had legal protection. The author is presenting a situation that's interesting. The first blank is in the phrase \"If we see certain forms of creative endeavor (i)_____ as a result of uncontrolled copying...\" So, if uncontrolled copying (which is possible because there's no legal protection) causes the creative work to do something, then we might decide to do something with the law. The options are languishing, proliferating, or diversifying. \n\nIf copying is uncontrolled, maybe the original works are suffering. \"Languishing\" means failing to thrive, which makes sense here. If they're languishing, then the laws might need to be extended to protect them. But wait, the first part says that some forms never had legal protection. So if without protection, they are struggling, maybe we should extend the law to cover them. Alternatively, if they are proliferating (growing) despite copying, maybe we don't need the laws. But the first part of the passage says that the laws are intended to stimulate creativity, but some forms don't have protection. The author is contrasting the intended effect with the reality. So if without protection, the creative works are languishing, then we might need to extend the laws. So blank (i) is probably \"languishing\".\n\nThen blank (ii) would be \"extend\" because if they're not doing well, we might want to apply the laws to them. Alternatively, if they are doing well without protection, maybe we should relax the laws. But the first part of the sentence is the \"if\" clause leading to a decision. So if they are languishing, then extend the law. If they are thriving, maybe we don't need the laws. So (ii) would be \"extend\".\n\nNow the third blank: \"Conversely, if unprotected creative work (iii)_____ in the absence of legal rules against copying...\" The converse situation. If in the absence of laws (no protection), the work still thrives, then we should know how that happens. So the third blank should be \"manages to thrive\". So the options here are \"declines in originality\", \"manages to thrive\", or \"openly invites imitation\". If it's thriving, that's the opposite of languishing, so the converse case. So (iii) is \"manages to thrive\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBlank (i): languishing (because uncontrolled copying is bad)\nBlank (ii): extend (so we need to apply the laws to protect them)\nBlank (iii): manages to thrive (since conversely, if they do well without laws, we need to understand why)\n\nCheck the options again. The first part says if they are languishing, we might extend the law. The second part says if they thrive without laws, we need to know how. That makes sense. The other options for blank (ii) could be \"relax\" or \"jettison\", but if the works are languishing, relaxing the laws (making them less strict) would make it worse. So \"extend\" is correct. For blank (iii), \"manages to thrive\" fits the converse scenario.\n</think>\n\nlanguishing, extend, manages to thrive\nExplanation: The passage contrasts two scenarios. If creative work \"languishes\" (fails to thrive) due to copying, we should \"extend\" legal protections. Conversely, if unprotected work \"manages to thrive\" despite copying, we need to understand how. This aligns with the logical flow of the argument and the contrast signaled by \"conversely.\"",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"Despite the (i)____________ nature of contemporary science...\" The word \"Despite\" indicates a contrast between the first part and the rest of the sentence. So whatever is in blank (i) is something that you might expect would lead to inclusion, but the reality is the opposite.\n\nLooking at the options for blank (i): collaborative, controversial, sophisticated. If science is collaborative, maybe people work together, but the next part talks about contributions being overlooked. So even though science is collaborative (working together), some people's work isn't recognized. That makes sense. Alternatively, sophisticated might mean complex, but how does that contrast with the exploitation mentioned? Maybe not as directly. Controversial doesn't seem to fit here. So probably collaborative for (i).\n\nNext, blank (ii) is \"the (ii)____________ of many individuals (iii)____________\". The colon after that introduces an explanation: women and minority scientists' work is exploited or considered rudimentary, not included in history books. So the part before the colon is saying that despite the collaborative nature, their contributions (maybe) remain overlooked. \n\nFor blank (ii), options are motivations, contributions, idiosyncrasies. The sentence is talking about their work being exploited or deemed unworthy. So their contributions (work) would be the thing that's overlooked. Motivations don't fit here. Idiosyncrasies are personal quirks, which doesn't relate to the exploitation of their work. So contributions for (ii).\n\nBlank (iii) has options: manifest themselves, point to a solution, remain overlooked. The colon explains that their work is exploited or not included. So the contributions remain overlooked. That fits. \"Manifest themselves\" would mean they become visible, which contradicts the colon's explanation. \"Point to a solution\" doesn't make sense here. So remain overlooked for (iii).\n\nPutting it all together: Despite the collaborative nature of science, the contributions of many individuals remain overlooked: their work is exploited or excluded. The contrast here is that even though science is a team effort (collaborative), some people's work isn't acknowledged. The colon explains that their work is treated poorly, so the blanks must align with that. So the answers should be collaborative, contributions, remain overlooked.\n</think>\n\nanswer1, answer2, answer3\ncollaborative, contributions, remain overlooked\nExplanation: The contrast introduced by \"Despite\" suggests that even though modern science is \"collaborative\" (working together), the \"contributions\" (work/results) of marginalized groups \"remain overlooked\" (ignored), as explained after the colon. This aligns with the exploitation and exclusion described.",

The passage is about children's truthfulness versus lying and how lying relates to their cognitive and social skills.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the overall structure. The first part says that because kids have active fantasy lives, one might think truthfulness is a certain type of virtue (Blank i). But then there's a contrast with \"but it turns out lying is the more ___ skill (Blank ii).\" The next sentences explain why lying is more advanced: the child has to recognize the truth, create an alternate reality, and sell it. So lying requires more cognitive work. Then the conclusion is that lying ___ cognitive development and social skills (Blank iii), which honesty doesn't.\n\nStarting with Blank i: The first sentence suggests that because children have active imaginations (fantasy lives), people might assume truthfulness is natural or instinctive. But the \"but\" introduces a contrast. So if lying is more advanced, then truthfulness might be considered something they don't have to learn. The options are instinctive, acquired, or conscious. If truthfulness is instinctive, that would mean it's natural, but the following part says lying is more advanced. Wait, but the first part is \"one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue in young children\"—so maybe people think kids are naturally truthful, but actually lying is harder. But the passage says lying is a more advanced skill, so truthfulness would be the opposite. So if lying is acquired (needs to be learned), then truthfulness is instinctive. But the first blank is about truthfulness. Wait, the structure is: given that kids have active fantasy lives (which might make them lie more?), but the author is saying that lying is actually a more advanced skill, so maybe the initial assumption is that truthfulness is not something they have to learn. So Blank i: maybe \"an instinctive\" virtue. Because if they have active fantasy lives, maybe people think they lie a lot, but the author is saying that lying is actually a more advanced skill. Wait, the first part says \"given children's active fantasy lives, one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue\". Hmm. If children have active fantasy lives (they imagine things, make up stories), then perhaps people would think that truthfulness is not natural for them. Wait, but the sentence is structured as \"given X, one might think Y\". So X is active fantasy lives. So if kids have a lot of fantasy, maybe people think that truthfulness is not instinctive, but the author is contrasting that with lying being more advanced. Wait, maybe the first blank is saying that because kids have active imaginations, people might think that truthfulness is something they have to learn (acquired), but actually lying is more advanced. Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me think again. The first part: \"Given children's active fantasy lives, one might think of truthfulness as (i)_____ virtue in young children, but it turns out that lying is the more (ii)_____ skill.\" So the idea is that since kids are imaginative (fantasy), maybe people assume that truthfulness is not natural (they lie a lot), but the author says lying is more advanced. Wait, maybe the first blank is \"an acquired\" virtue. Because if kids are naturally inclined to fantasy (lying), then truthfulness would be something they have to learn (acquired). So the first blank would be \"acquired\". But the structure is \"given X, one might think Y\". So X is active fantasy lives. If X is that they have active fantasy lives (so they make up stories, lie), then people might think that truthfulness is not instinctive (i.e., they have to learn it). So the first blank would be \"an acquired\" virtue. But then the \"but\" introduces that lying is more advanced. So the author is saying that even though people might think truthfulness is acquired (because kids are naturally lying), actually lying is a more advanced skill. That makes sense. Because if you think kids are naturally prone to lying (due to fantasy), then you might think that telling the truth is something they have to learn (acquired). But the author is saying that lying is actually more advanced, so it's not that they lie naturally; lying requires more cognitive skills. So Blank i: \"an acquired\" (since people might think truthfulness is learned, but the reality is that lying is even more complex). Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let's check the options again. Blank i options: instinctive, acquired, conscious. If the first part is \"given that children have active fantasy lives (so they make up things), one might think that truthfulness is a (i)_____ virtue\". If people think that because kids have active imaginations, they are not truthful, then perhaps the assumption is that truthfulness is not natural (so they have to acquire it). So the first blank would be \"an acquired\" virtue. But the author is contrasting that with lying being more advanced. So the logic is: people might think that being truthful is something kids have to learn (acquired), but actually lying is even more advanced (so it's even more learned). Therefore, the first blank is \"an acquired\". Alternatively, maybe people think that truthfulness is instinctive (natural), but the author says lying is more advanced. Wait, but why would active fantasy lives make someone think truthfulness is instinctive? That seems contradictory. If kids have active fantasy lives, maybe people think they lie a lot, so truthfulness is not instinctive. Wait, maybe the reasoning is: because children have active fantasy lives (they imagine things, which could lead to lying), one might think that truthfulness is not an instinctive virtue (i.e., they have to learn it). But the author says that lying is actually more advanced. So the first blank would be \"an acquired\" virtue. So the first answer is \"an acquired\".\n\nNow Blank ii: lying is the more ___ skill. The following sentences explain that lying requires recognizing the truth, creating an alternate reality, and selling it. So lying is more complex, so the blank should be \"advanced\". The options are advanced, practical, mundane. \"Advanced\" fits here. So Blank ii: advanced.\n\nBlank iii: lying ___ cognitive development and social skills. The sentence says that honesty doesn't do this. The previous explanation says that lying requires those steps, so lying \"demands\" cognitive development and social skills. The options are undermines, forgoes, demands. So \"demands\" makes sense. Because lying requires (demands) those skills. So Blank iii: demands.\n\nPutting it all together: Blank i: an acquired (since people might think truthfulness is learned, given their fantasy), but lying is more advanced (ii: advanced), and lying demands (iii) those skills.\n</think>\n\nanswer1, answer2, answer3\nan acquired, advanced, demands\nExplanation: The passage contrasts the assumption that truthfulness is learned (\"acquired\") due to children's fantasy-prone nature with the reality that lying is a more complex (\"advanced\") skill requiring cognitive effort. Lying \"demands\" development of cognitive and social skills, as it involves creating and persuading others of an alternate reality, unlike honesty.",

The passage is about traditional Vietnamese culture promoting gender equality, but there's a contrast between theory and reality. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first blank is in the sentence about founding myths doing something regarding the equal division of labor. The passage starts by saying the culture promotes gender equality, so the myths probably support that idea. The options are obscure, celebrate, or countermand. \"Celebrate\" makes sense here because myths would highlight or honor the equal division. Obscure would mean hiding it, which doesn't fit. Countermand means to go against, which contradicts the initial statement. So blank (i) is probably celebrate.\n\nNext, the second blank comes after \"As is often the case, however, theoretical commitments are (ii)_____ actual processes.\" The \"however\" signals a contrast. The first part says they promote equality, but the reality is different. So the theoretical commitments (like the myths) don't match the actual. The options are incommensurate with, surpassed by, inspired by. \"Incommensurate with\" means not matching in measure, which fits here. Surpassed by would mean the actual is better, but the next sentence says gender-based something persists, which is negative. So theoretical ideas don't align with reality. So (ii) is incommensurate with.\n\nThird blank: \"In reality, gender-based (iii)_____ persists.\" Since the first part talks about equality, but reality is different, the blank should be a term indicating inequality. The options are parity (equality), inclusiveness (including everyone), or stratification (layers, hierarchy). Stratification implies a hierarchy based on gender, which is a form of inequality. So (iii) is stratification.\n\nPutting it all together: The myths celebrate equality, but theory doesn't match reality (incommensurate), leading to stratification. The answer should be celebrate, incommensurate with, stratification.\n</think>\n\ncelebrate, incommensurate with, stratification\nExplanation: The passage contrasts theoretical gender equality in myths with persistent inequality in reality. \"Celebrate\" aligns with myths promoting equality. \"Incommensurate with\" highlights the mismatch between theory and practice. \"Stratification\" denotes hierarchical gender inequality, contrasting with the initial claim of parity.",

The key points are that despite their (i)____ superior resources, they couldn't impose their will. Also, they couldn't assume that markets would (ii)____. Instead, they had to develop strategies to (iii)____ such markets compatible with regional politics.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i): The sentence starts with \"Despite their (i)____ superior financial and organizational resources...\" So, despite having something related to resources, they couldn't impose their will. The options are remoteness from, ignorance of, access to. \"Despite\" implies that they had these resources, so the blank should be a positive term. \"Access to\" makes sense here because having access to resources would be an advantage, but even with that, they couldn't impose their will. \"Remoteness from\" or \"ignorance of\" would mean they lacked something, which doesn't fit with \"despite\" since despite is used to contrast a strength with an unexpected outcome. So Blank (i) is \"access to\".\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The sentence says they couldn't assume that properly functioning markets would (ii)____. The options are spontaneously emerge, ultimately fail, occasionally struggle. The next sentence says they had to develop strategies to (iii)____ such markets. So if they couldn't assume markets would just appear on their own, then the blank here should be \"spontaneously emerge\". Because if they thought markets would emerge by themselves, but they couldn't assume that, so they had to create them. So Blank (ii) is \"spontaneously emerge\".\n\nBlank (iii): They had to develop strategies to (iii)____ such markets compatible with regional politics. The options are construct, restrain, serve. Since they couldn't assume markets would emerge, they had to build them. So \"construct\" fits here. \"Restrain\" or \"serve\" don't make sense in this context. So Blank (iii) is \"construct\".\n\nPutting it all together: access to, spontaneously emerge, construct. The explanation would be that despite having access to resources, they couldn't impose their will or expect markets to emerge on their own, so they had to construct them.\n</think>\n\naccess to, spontaneously emerge, construct\nExplanation: The first blank requires a positive attribute (access to resources) contrasted by \"despite.\" The second blank contrasts with the need to \"develop strategies,\" implying markets wouldn't form on their own (spontaneously emerge). The third blank aligns with actively creating markets (construct) rather than restraining or serving them.",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Blank (i): The sentence says these interactions are crucial for forging self-identity. The options are adult, wide-ranging, or peer. Well, during adolescence, peers are really influential. Adults are important, but the process of forming identity is often more about peers. So maybe \"peer\" interactions here.\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The process plays out in some way that defines the self. The sentence mentions kids seeking like-minded companions and spurning others. That sounds like forming cliques. So \"cliquish social behavior\" fits here. The other options are dramatic personality changes or heightened sociability. But the example given is about grouping with similar peers, which is cliquish.\n\nThen Blank (iii): The in-group something that evolves into mature friendships. The options are alienation, clustering, competition. The previous sentence talks about seeking like-minded friends, so clustering makes sense. Clustering refers to grouping together. If it's kept within bounds, this clustering becomes more mature. Alienation would be negative, and competition isn't directly mentioned. So \"clustering\" is the answer.\n\nPutting it all together: peer interactions are crucial, the process involves cliquish behavior, and in-group clustering evolves into mature patterns. The transitions like \"but\" suggest that even though there's cliquishness, when it's not excessive, it leads to maturity. So the answers should be peer, cliquish social behavior, clustering.\n</think>\n\npeer, cliquish social behavior, clustering\nExplanation: The passage discusses adolescent identity formation. Blank (i) requires \"peer\" because adolescence centers on interactions with equals. Blank (ii) aligns with \"cliquish social behavior\" as the text describes excluding others to define identity. Blank (iii) is \"clustering\" since grouping with like-minded peers (in-group behavior) evolves into mature friendships when moderated.",

The passage is about the myth that Marco Polo introduced pasta to the Western world after encountering it in China. The main point seems to be that this myth is not true because there's evidence in Italy of pasta before Marco Polo's time.\n\nLooking at the first blank (i), the sentence says the myth \"_____ that nothing should have been known of pasta in Italy until 1295...\" The myth is making a claim, so the verb here should be something like \"requires\" or \"suggests.\" The options are requires, demonstrated, symbolizes. \"Requires\" fits because the myth would necessitate that belief. \"Demonstrated\" would mean the myth proved it, but the context is that the myth is false, so the myth itself isn't proving anything. \"Symbolizes\" doesn't fit here. So Blank (i) is probably \"requires.\"\n\nNext, Blank (ii): The myth can be easily _____ by pointing out Italian references that exist. Since the references contradict the myth, the myth is being disproven. The options are augmented (increased), debunked (exposed as false), traced. So \"debunked\" makes sense here. If you debunk a myth, you show it's false. So Blank (ii) is \"debunked.\"\n\nBlank (iii): The Italian references to pasta that _____ must be something that shows they existed before 1295. The options are praise its virtues, can be authenticated, predate that event. \"Predate that event\" (Marco Polo's return in 1295) would directly contradict the myth. So Blank (iii) is \"predate that event.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The myth requires that pasta wasn't known until 1295, but it's debunked by references that predate that event. The answers should be requires, debunked, predate that event.\n</think>\n\nrequires, debunked, predate that event\nExplanation: The myth \"requires\" (implies) pasta was unknown in Italy before 1295. It is \"debunked\" (disproven) by references that \"predate that event\" (exist before Marco Polo's return), showing pasta was already known. \"Requires\" aligns with the myth's premise, \"debunked\" with refutation, and \"predate\" establishes chronological contradiction.",

The first blank is (i)_____, and the options are malady, indiscretion, prognosis. The sentence says \"therapies for every conceivable (i)_____ from broken bones to liver complaints.\" Hmm. The phrase \"every conceivable\" suggests something that covers a wide range of health issues. \"Broken bones\" and \"liver complaints\" are both medical problems. So, the word here should mean a medical condition or ailment. Let's look at the options.\n\nMalady means a disease or ailment. Indiscretion is more about lack of judgment or a minor offense, which doesn't fit here. Prognosis is the likely course of a disease, so that's about prediction, not the condition itself. So Blank (i) is probably \"malady.\"\n\nMoving to Blank (ii): \"The local mud, saltwater, etc., have been deemed (ii)_____ by the German medical system...\" The next part says the medical system does something with some treatments, and consequently, the treatments are widely used. If the medical system approves or supports them, then the treatments would be considered beneficial. The options are healthful, suspect, innocuous. If they are deemed healthful, that makes sense. Suspect would mean they're questionable, but then why would the medical system support them? Innocuous means harmless, but maybe not necessarily beneficial. But the key is that the medical system does something that leads to their wide use. So if the medical system funds them (Blank iii), then they must think they're effective. So Blank (ii) would be \"healthful.\" If they were suspect, the system wouldn't fund them. So (ii) is healthful.\n\nNow Blank (iii): \"which (iii)_____ some of these treatments.\" The German medical system does this action, leading to their wide use. The options are doubts, denies, funds. If the system funds them, that explains why they're widely used. If they doubted or denied, that would contradict the wide use. So (iii) is funds.\n\nPutting it all together: The therapies are for every malady, deemed healthful, and the system funds them. That makes sense. The flow is that the medical system approves (deems healthful) and provides funding, leading to widespread use.\n</think>\n\nmalady, healthful, funds\nExplanation: The first blank requires a term for medical issues, so \"malady\" fits. The therapies are deemed beneficial (\"healthful\") by the medical system, which logically \"funds\" them, explaining their widespread use. \"Indiscretion\" and \"prognosis\" don't fit contextually for Blank (i). \"Suspect\" or \"innocuous\" in Blank (ii) would contradict the system's support. \"Doubts\" or \"denies\" in Blank (iii) would not lead to the treatments being widely used.",

The next sentence says it's a \"particularly well-studied area,\" so the first blank should mean something like \"well-researched\" or \"familiar.\" The options are unfamiliar, well-worked, fruitful. \"Well-worked\" fits here because it means the ground has been extensively studied.\n\nMoving to the second blank: \"Anyone familiar with the authoritative work... will (ii)_____ little in Thaler's study that is (iii)_____.\" The structure here is that if someone knows the existing work, they won't find much new in Thaler's study.

The phrase \"little\" here suggests that they don't have much of something. If it's \"consensus regarding,\" that would mean they mostly agree, but \"little consensus\" would imply disagreement. But the sentence starts with \"Biologists have little...\" and the next part is \"drawing the link...\" So maybe they don't feel bad about it. \"Compunction\" means a feeling of guilt, so \"little compunction about\" would mean they don't hesitate or feel guilty. That makes sense because the next sentence says \"indeed, many biologists claim...\" which supports the idea that they are confident in making this link. So maybe (i) is compunction about.\n\nThen blank (ii): \"the success of humanity and human (ii)_____.\" The attribute that leads to success. The third blank is the ability to do something, which is described as making individuals subordinate self-interest to the group. That sounds like cooperation. So (iii) is cooperate. Then, the attribute (ii) would be sociability, since cooperation is part of being social. Or maybe uniqueness? No, uniqueness doesn't directly relate to cooperation. Resilience is about enduring, which isn't the same. So (ii) is sociability.\n\nPutting it all together: Biologists don't feel bad (compunction) about linking success to sociability, and the ability is to cooperate. Let me check the options again. Blank (i): compunction about. Blank (ii): sociability. Blank (iii): cooperate. That seems to fit.

In contrast, altering the brain can produce results that are \"startlingly\" something.\n\nFor blank (i), the options are \"even more troubling,\" \"more difficult to understand,\" or \"much less interesting.\" The passage seems to argue that neuroscience's implications are more significant than genetics.

So \"vanished\" fits here.\n\nBlank (iii) is describing the results of altering the brain. The contrast is with genetics, which takes decades. So altering the brain's functioning must produce results quickly. The adverb \"startlingly\" modifies the adjective. \"Rapid\" makes sense here because it's about speed, contrasting with the decades-long wait for genetic experiments. \"Unexpected\" might not fit as well because the first part said neuroscience's changes are more predictable. \"Far-reaching\" could be possible, but the key contrast is time.

The first blank is describing the nature of this power. The options are cumulative, measurable, unclear. \n\nThe sentence after the colon says that most researchers found that including laughter on the soundtrack does something to the overall perception of humor. Then there's an \"although\" which introduces a contrast. So the main finding is that the inclusion has a certain effect overall, but it can do something else at specific points, boosting the total appeal.\n\nLooking at the second blank options: allows variations in, tends to accentuate, has little effect on. If the first part after the colon is supporting the first blank, then the first blank's answer should align with the researchers' findings. If the first blank is \"unclear,\" then the colon would be introducing something that contradicts that, but the colon is supposed to explain or elaborate. So if the first blank is \"measurable,\" then the colon explains that researchers have measured it. Alternatively, if the first blank is \"cumulative,\" but cumulative might mean it builds up over time, but the rest of the sentence talks about overall vs. specific points. \n\nWait, the colon is introducing evidence from researchers. So if the first blank is \"measurable,\" then the colon is giving the measurement. So \"most researchers have found...\" supports that the effect is measurable. If the first blank were \"unclear,\" the colon would have to explain why it's unclear, but here the colon is presenting findings, which would make it clearer.

The \"although\" suggests that the second and third blanks are contrasting. So if the second blank is \"has little effect on\" the overall, but the third is \"enhance\" at specific points, then the total is boosted. But the first part of the sentence after the colon says \"most researchers have found that inclusion... (ii)____________ the overall perception of humor,\" so if the overall effect is little, but specific points are enhanced, then the total is boosted. That makes sense. But the first part of the sentence is saying that the power is measurable because researchers found that the inclusion does X to overall. If the overall effect is little, then the power's effect is measurable but perhaps not strong. But the colon is supposed to explain the first blank. If the first blank is \"unclear,\" but the colon is presenting research findings, which would make it clearer. So maybe the first blank is \"measurable,\" then the second blank is \"has little effect on\" the overall, but the third is \"enhance\" at specific points. Wait, but the sentence after the colon is structured as: \"most researchers have found that inclusion... (ii)____________ the overall perception of humor, although it appears that it can (iii)____________ humor at specific points and thus boost the total...\" So the main finding is about the overall effect, and the \"although\" introduces a contrasting point where it helps in specific parts, leading to a total boost. So if the overall effect is negative or neutral, but specific points are positive, leading to a total boost. But how does that work? For example, if the inclusion of laughter has little effect on the overall perception, but enhances at specific points, which adds up to a total boost. That seems possible. Alternatively, if the inclusion tends to accentuate the overall perception (makes it seem funnier overall), but even though it can enhance specific points. Wait, but the \"although\" would then be a contrast. If the main effect is that it accentuates the overall, but even though it can enhance specific points, that doesn't make sense. The \"although\" would need a contrast. So maybe the main effect is that it has little effect on the overall, but even though it can enhance specific points, which then sum up to a total boost. That makes sense. Because if the overall effect is not much, but specific points are enhanced, leading to a total increase. So the first blank is \"measurable\" because researchers have found these effects. Then (ii) is \"has little effect on\" and (iii) is \"enhance.\" Let me check the options again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first blank is \"unclear,\" but that would conflict with the colon introducing research findings. So \"measurable\" is better. Then (ii) \"has little effect on\" the overall, but (iii) \"enhance\" specific points. Then the total is boosted. That seems to fit. So the answer would be measurable, has little effect on, enhance. Let me check the options again. \n\nBlank (i) options: cumulative, measurable, unclear. If the effect is cumulative, that would mean it builds up over time, but the passage talks about overall vs. specific points. So \"measurable\" fits better. \n\nBlank (ii): \"has little effect on\" the overall perception. Then, even though it can enhance specific points, which adds up to a total boost. That makes sense. So the answer would be measurable, has little effect on, enhance. \n\nYes, that seems to fit. The colon explains that the effect is measurable because research shows that while laughter doesn't affect the overall much, it enhances specific moments, thus increasing the total humor.\n</think>\n\nmeasurable, has little effect on, enhance\nExplanation: The colon after blank (i) introduces research findings, indicating the effect is \"measurable.\" The second blank's \"has little effect on\" aligns with the main finding about overall perception, while \"although\" introduces a contrast where \"enhance\" fits specific points boosting total appeal.",

The goal is to fill in the three blanks with the correct options.\n\nFirst, I'll read the entire passage carefully. The first sentence says that the fossils give new insights into early whale ancestors. Then, the example of Maiacetus inuus is given. The first blank (i) describes what kind of land animal it was. The next part talks about a fossil with a fetus positioned for head-first delivery, typical of land mammals, suggesting they gave birth onshore. But then there's a contrast with \"But it probably spent much of its time (ii)_____\". The reasons given are big teeth for catching fish and flipper-like feet that must have been (iii)_____ walking.\n\nStarting with Blank (i): The sentence structure is \"Maiacetus inuus was a land animal (i)_____ life in the sea.\" The options are resistant, removed from, adapted to. Since whales evolved from land animals that transitioned to aquatic life, \"adapted to\" makes sense here. \"Resistant\" would mean they opposed sea life, which doesn't fit. \"Removed from\" would imply they were separated from the sea, but the following sentences suggest they spent time in water. So Blank (i) is likely \"adapted to\".\n\nBlank (ii): The sentence after \"But\" contrasts the fact that they gave birth onshore (land) with spending time in the water. The clues are big teeth for catching fish (which live in water) and flipper-like feet. So the answer here should be \"in the water\". The other options, fleeing predators or protecting young, aren't supported by the given reasons.\n\nBlank (iii): The flipper-like feet must have been something related to walking. The options are incompatible with, clumsy for, strengthened by. Flippers are more suited for swimming than walking. So if the feet are flipper-like, they might not be good for walking. \"Incompatible with\" seems too strong. \"Clumsy for\" suggests they can walk but not efficiently. \"Strengthened by\" doesn't fit because flippers would hinder walking. So \"clumsy for\" makes sense here. The feet were flipper-like, so walking would be awkward, hence \"clumsy for\".\n</think>\n\nadapted to, in the water, clumsy for\nExplanation: Blank (i) requires \"adapted to\" because the species transitioned to marine life while retaining land traits. Blank (ii) is \"in the water\" as teeth and flipper-like feet indicate aquatic activity. Blank (iii) is \"clumsy for\" since flipper-like feet would make terrestrial walking awkward but not impossible.",

                "model_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this GRE Text Completion question. Hmm, the passage is about Clark and how people perceive him. The first part says that people took his \"old-mannered compliance\" as obsequiousness. Wait, obsequiousness means being overly eager to please or obey, right? So they thought his compliance was being subservient. But the first blank says they (i) him. The colon after that introduces an explanation. So the part after the colon explains why their initial judgment was wrong.\n\nThe key here is that his apparent something (Blank ii) veiled a fervent something (Blank iii) of authority. The colon indicates that the second part explains the first. So if they took his compliance as obsequiousness, but actually, his apparent behavior (maybe compliance) was hiding a strong feeling against authority. So the people misunderstood him. So Blank i would be \"misconstrued\" because they misinterpreted his compliance. \n\nFor Blank ii, the word \"apparent\" suggests that what people saw (his compliance) was not the real feeling. The options are cynicism, acquiescence, intractability. Acquiescence means agreement or compliance, which fits with \"old-mannered compliance.\" So his apparent acquiescence (compliance) was actually hiding a fervent Blank iii. The third blank is about his feeling towards authority. Since he sabotaged their projects, which is a negative action, he must detest the authority. So Blank iii is detestation. \n\nPutting it all together: People misconstrued him because his apparent acquiescence veiled a detestation of authority, leading him to sabotage projects. So the answers are misconstrued, acquiescence, detestation.\n</think>\n\nmisconstrued, acquiescence, detestation\nExplanation: The colon indicates the latter clause explains why people's initial judgment of Clark was incorrect. \"Old-mannered compliance\" being mistaken for obsequiousness (excessive subservience) shows they misunderstood (misconstrued) him. His apparent compliance (acquiescence) masked a hidden strong dislike (detestation) of authority, evidenced by his sabotage of projects. \"Detestation\" aligns with negative actions against authority, while \"acquiescence\" matches \"compliance\" in the context.",

Hmm, the passage is about two opposing theories regarding mountain formation and climate over the past 40 million years. The first sentence says either the surge of mountain building (i)_____ the global cooling or vice versa. So the two theories are opposites: one says mountains caused cooling, the other says cooling caused mountains.\n\nFor blank (i), the options are superseded, halted, caused. Since the theories are opposing, if one is \"X caused Y\", the other is \"Y caused X\". So the first theory would be that mountain building caused the cooling. So blank (i) should be \"caused\". That makes sense because \"either X caused Y or vice versa\" (Y caused X). So answer1 is \"caused\".\n\nNext, the second blank: the first theory says that mountain building cooled the earth as a result of the (ii)_____ mountains and climate. The example given is about mountain glaciers being something, and once established, they increase reflectivity, lower temperatures, leading to more ice. This sounds like a feedback loop. So the feedback between mountains and climate. Because the process described is a cycle where one affects the other, reinforcing the effect. So blank (ii) is \"feedback between\". Answer2 is \"feedback between\".\n\nThird blank: mountain glaciers tend to be (iii)_____. The colon introduces an explanation. Once established, they increase reflectivity, lower temps, allow more ice. So this is a self-reinforcing process. The term here would be \"self-perpetuating\". Because once they start, they keep themselves going. So answer3 is \"self-perpetuating\".\n\nLet me check again. The first theory is that mountain building caused cooling. The mechanism is a feedback between mountains and climate. Glaciers are self-perpetuating because their existence leads to more of them. Yep, that all fits. The other options don't make sense. For example, \"disparity between\" wouldn't explain the interaction, and \"complexity of\" is vague. \"Self-perpetuating\" fits the example given. So the answers are caused, feedback between, self-perpetuating.\n</think>\n\ncaused, feedback between, self-perpetuating\nExplanation: The first theory posits mountain building \"caused\" cooling (opposite of vice versa). The example describes a cyclical interaction (glaciers enhancing conditions for more ice), requiring \"feedback between\" mountains and climate. \"Self-perpetuating\" directly matches the glacier's described behavior of sustaining their own growth.",
