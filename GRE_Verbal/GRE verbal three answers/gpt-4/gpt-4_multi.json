In the second blank, \"produce\" makes the most sense because the passage suggests that the frog does not create the toxins itself, and \"produce\" indicates the act of creating or generating something.  \n3. For the third blank, \"eaten\" fits best because the passage suggests that the beetles are the source of the toxins, implying that the frogs acquire the toxins by consuming the beetles. \"Eaten\" logically explains how the frogs obtain the toxins.",

For Blank (i), \"expensive\" fits because the argument hinges on the high cost of diamonds. For Blank (ii), \"useless\" aligns with the idea that diamonds lack practical utility, supporting the argument about wealth or appearances. For Blank (iii), \"serve no practical purpose\" logically completes the sentence, emphasizing the lack of functional value in such purchases.",
