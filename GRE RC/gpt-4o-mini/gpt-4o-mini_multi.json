This implies that the study was not initially designed to investigate social learning directly, but rather how group density affects foraging success, which can be related to social learning. The other options do not align with the information provided in the passage. For instance, option B suggests that the study required observing guppies over their life spans, which is not mentioned. Option C contradicts the findings, as the study indicates that population density does affect social learning.

For the conclusion that increased Internet use causes depression to hold, it must be assumed that the reason for the increase in Internet use is not due to a prior decrease in face-to-face social contact.

Second, it states that \"the polar atmosphere is thin, so little energy is required to warm it,\" which aligns with option C regarding the relatively thin atmosphere at the poles. \n\nOption A, which refers to the amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles, is mentioned in the passage but does not directly indicate that it leads to large temperature swings; rather, it states that \"less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics,\" which does not support the idea of contributing to temperature swings.

The passage confirms that social learning is documented among fish but emphasizes that few studies have looked at the developmental context, supporting this inference.\n   - **E**: This option claims that research on fish has been more extensive than on other aquatic animals. The passage does not provide any information to support or refute this claim.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - Options A, B, C, and E do not align with the information provided in the passage. Option D is consistent with the passage's assertion that while social learning is established, the developmental context has not been extensively studied.\n\nThus, the best answer is D, as it accurately reflects the content of the passage regarding the state of research on social learning in fish.",

It highlights that guppies raised in smaller groups were better at locating food by following a trained adult compared to those raised in larger groups. It also mentions that high-density conditions led guppies to view conspecifics as competitors rather than sources of information, suggesting implications for social learning.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning.**  \n     This option is plausible because the passage states that the study focused on group density and its effects, which could imply a broader focus than just social learning. However, it does not explicitly state that the study was designed for something else.\n   - **B. It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life spans.**  \n     The passage does not mention observing individual guppies over time; it focuses on group density and foraging success without specifying the need for longitudinal observation.\n   - **C. It pointed to the possibility that population density may have little to do with guppies’ social learning.**  \n     This option contradicts the findings presented in the passage, which suggest that population density significantly affects social learning.\n   - **D. It required the observation of guppies under conditions that closely mimicked the conditions of guppies in the wild.**  \n     The passage does not indicate that the conditions were meant to mimic the wild; it mentions laboratory housing, which suggests controlled conditions rather than natural ones.\n   - **E. It indicated that guppies gain adaptive information from being reared with a relatively large number of conspecifics.**  \n     This option is incorrect because the passage states that guppies raised in high-density conditions were less likely to learn the benefits of social learning and viewed conspecifics as competitors.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - A is the most reasonable inference since the study focused on group density, which could suggest a broader aim than just social learning. However, it is not definitively stated.\n   - B, C, D, and E are incorrect based on the passage's content.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A\n\n**Reasoning**: Option A is the best choice because the study's focus on group density implies that it may not have been solely about social learning, aligning with the passage's description of the study's aims.

An assumption is something that must be true for the argument to hold.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant information in the passage**: The passage argues that increased Internet use correlates with higher rates of depression due to decreased face-to-face social contact. The key points are that increased Internet use leads to less social interaction, which can precipitate depression.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. In general, the reason that the people in the studies had doubled their Internet use was not that they had earlier experienced a significant decrease in opportunities for face-to-face social contact.**\n     - This option suggests that the increase in Internet use is not due to a prior decrease in social contact. If this were not true, the correlation between Internet use and depression could be explained by other factors. This is a valid assumption for the argument.\n   \n   - **B. A sharp decrease in face-to-face social contact is the only change in daily activity that can lead to an increased incidence of depression.**\n     - This option is too strong. The argument does not claim that it is the only change that can lead to depression, just that it is a significant factor. Therefore, this is not a necessary assumption.\n   \n   - **C. Using the Internet presents no opportunities for people to increase the amount of face-to-face social contact they experienced in their daily lives.**\n     - This option implies that Internet use does not provide any social opportunities, which is not necessarily true.

The passage supports this idea by proposing that the theory could resolve many conflicting results. This aligns well with the author's perspective.\n   - **C**: This option claims that inconsistencies arise from trying to fit results into an inadequate theory. While the passage mentions the absence of a general theory, it does not directly state that this is the cause of inconsistencies. Therefore, this option is not fully supported.\n   - **D**: This option states that no general theory has emerged because studies have not accurately assessed invasions. The passage does not make this claim; it focuses on the lack of a general theory without attributing it to assessment inaccuracies. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n   - **E**: This option suggests that results show lower susceptibility to invasion than expected. The passage does not support this claim; it discusses the variability of results without making a definitive statement about overall susceptibility levels.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: Based on the analysis, option **B** is the only one that aligns with the author's perspective regarding the potential for a theory based on resource availability to explain inconsistencies in field study results. The other options either misinterpret the passage or are not supported by it.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: B\n\n**Reasoning**: Option B is correct because it accurately reflects the author's argument that incorporating fluctuating resource availability could clarify the inconsistencies found in previous studies. The author suggests that this theory could integrate existing hypotheses and resolve ambiguities, making this option the best choice. The other options either misinterpret the passage or introduce ideas that are not supported by the text, leading to their elimination.",

It mentions that this theory could integrate existing hypotheses and resolve conflicting results. It also notes that there is no necessary relationship between species diversity and susceptibility to invasion, which could explain some of the inconsistencies.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. It explains how a particular circumstance can produce disparate effects.**: This aligns with the passage's idea that varying resource availability can lead to different outcomes in terms of invasibility, thus resolving inconsistencies.\n   - **B. It does not assume that all of the results are instances of the phenomenon that the theory is intended to explain.**: This option is vague and does not directly relate to the passage's content about resource availability.\n   - **C. It predicts that seemingly minor variations in research methodology can have a dramatic effect on results.**: The passage does not discuss research methodology or its variations; it focuses on resource availability.\n   - **D. Its account is based on a statistical tendency rather than on the supposition that the results arise from a causal connection.**: The passage does not emphasize a statistical tendency; it discusses the relationship between resource availability and invasibility.\n   - **E. It indicates why a similar outcome may be preceded by very different circumstances on different occasions.**: While this option touches on variability, it does not directly relate to the main idea of resource availability affecting invasibility.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - Options B, C, D, and E do not accurately reflect the main idea of the theory presented in the passage. \n   - Option A is the best choice as it captures the essence of how the theory can explain the disparate effects of resource availability on invasibility.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A, as it directly relates to the theory's ability to account for varying effects based on resource availability.",

It discusses the contributions of two historians, which supports the idea of tracing the evolution of this practice. While option D is relevant, the passage's main concern is more about the evolution of the practice rather than merely citing competing views. Therefore, C is the most accurate choice.",

This option is not supported by the text.\n   \n   - **C. They exaggerate the extent to which Fern intended her writing to serve a social purpose.**  \n     This option implies that critics misinterpret Fern's intentions, but Tompkins's view does not suggest exaggeration; rather, it highlights a different understanding of the purpose of sentimentality. Thus, this option is not aligned with Tompkins's perspective.\n   \n   - **D.

It also mentions that in altricial species, studies have focused on limitations during chick rearing, while in precocial species, factors like food availability for egg-laying females may play a more significant role.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **Option A**: \"In altricial species, clutch size is determined primarily by factors operating after eggs are laid.\" This aligns with the passage, which states that studies focused on limitations during chick rearing in altricial species.\n   - **Option B**: \"In precocial species, clutch size is determined primarily by factors operating after eggs are laid.\" This contradicts the passage, which indicates that in precocial species, factors affecting clutch size are more related to food availability for egg-laying females, not after the eggs are laid.\n   - **Option C**: \"In many bird species, clutch size generally remains well below the potential limit of egg production.\" This is consistent with Lack's view as mentioned in the passage, which states that clutch size is far below the potential limit of egg production.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - Option A is correct as it reflects Lack's perspective on altricial species.\n   - Option B is incorrect because it misrepresents Lack's view on precocial species.\n   - Option C is also correct as it aligns with Lack's assertion about clutch size being below the potential limit.\n\nSince the question asks for which statement Lack would agree with, and both A and C are consistent with his views, we need to choose the one that best captures his perspective on the factors affecting clutch size.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: C\n\n**Reasoning**: Option C is the best choice because it encapsulates Lack's overall view that clutch size is generally below the potential limit of egg production, which is a central theme in the passage. While Option A is also correct, it is more specific to altricial species and does not encompass the broader idea that Lack proposed about clutch size across many bird species. Therefore, C is the most comprehensive and accurate reflection of Lack's views.",

The passage specifically notes that a titanic collision between Earth and a Mars-size impactor may have resulted in the formation of the Moon.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A**: This option suggests that titanic collision models explain some anomalies but leave others unexplained. The passage does not discuss anomalies or the limitations of these models, so this option is not supported.\n   - **B**: This option claims that such models are more likely to explain the formation of multi-ring basins. The passage does not make a comparison between titanic collision models and earlier models regarding multi-ring basins, so this is not supported.\n   - **C**: This option states that the models may be useful in explaining impacts involving bodies of highly dissimilar mean densities. The passage does not address the density of the impacting bodies, so this is not supported.\n   - **D**: This option asserts that the models have been tested to the point of being considered definitive. The passage does not provide any information about the testing or conclusiveness of these models, so this is not supported.\n   - **E**: This option suggests that the models are tempting and may be used indiscriminately to explain unusual planetary features. The passage implies that titanic collision models are significant in explaining certain features (like the Moon's formation) but does not indicate that they are used indiscriminately or that they are overly tempting.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - Options A, B, C, D, and E do not have direct support from the passage. However, option E is the closest to a reasonable interpretation of the passage's implications about the models being significant yet potentially overused. The passage does not explicitly state that they are used indiscriminately, but it hints at the complexity of explaining planetary features, which aligns with the caution implied in option E.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: E\n\n**Reasoning**: \n- **Correct Choice (E)**: While the passage does not explicitly state that titanic collision models are used indiscriminately, it does imply that they are significant in explaining planetary features, which could lead to a temptation to apply them broadly. This aligns with the caution suggested in option E.\n- **Incorrect Choices**: \n   - A is incorrect because the passage does not discuss anomalies.\n   - B is incorrect as it does not compare models.\n   - C is incorrect since the passage does not mention density.\n   - D is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the testing or conclusiveness of the models. \n\nThus, option E is the most reasonable interpretation based on the passage's content.",

It mentions Jupiter's role in protecting Earth from comet impacts and the specific conditions necessary for life, but it does not directly mention Mars or its oscillating tilt.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. provide evidence for a proposition about the potential effects of cometary impacts**: The passage discusses the role of Jupiter in preventing comet impacts on Earth, but it does not mention Mars in this context.\n   - **B. emphasize the absence from our solar system of normal planets**: The passage does emphasize that the planets are unique and not \"normal\" as predicted by theories, but it does not specifically mention Mars's tilt in this context.\n   - **C. contrast the rotational axis of Mars with that of Venus**: The passage does not discuss the rotational axes of Mars or Venus, so this option is not supported.\n   - **D. characterize the role of other planets in the solar system in Earth's development**: This option aligns with the passage's theme of discussing how the characteristics of other planets, like Jupiter, influence the conditions on Earth. However, it does not specifically relate to Mars's oscillating tilt.\n   - **E. emphasize the importance of the Moon to the development of life on Earth**: The passage does not mention the Moon at all, making this option incorrect.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: Since the passage does not provide information about Mars's oscillating tilt, we must consider the broader context. The mention of Mars could relate to the role of other planets in shaping conditions on Earth, which aligns with option D. However, since the question specifically asks about the mention of Mars's oscillating tilt, and none of the options directly address this, we must conclude that the question may be misleading or that the passage does not provide enough context for a definitive answer.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best answer is **D**, as it relates to the overall theme of planetary interactions affecting Earth's development.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: D\n\n**Reasoning**: Option D is the most relevant because the passage discusses how the characteristics of other planets, including their gravitational effects and orbital parameters, contribute to the conditions necessary for life on Earth. While the passage does not explicitly mention Mars's oscillating tilt, it fits within the broader context of how planetary dynamics influence Earth's environment. The other options either misinterpret the passage or introduce elements not discussed in the text, making them less suitable.",

It mentions that the existence of water in a liquid state is contingent on Earth's orbital parameters and suggests that without Jupiter's gravitational influence, Earth would have experienced more frequent comet impacts, which could have affected the availability of water.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. It was conveyed to Earth by comets.**: The passage implies that comets could have brought water to Earth, especially given the context of bombardment by comets. This option is supported by the idea that without Jupiter, Earth would have faced more frequent comet impacts.\n   - **B. It appeared on Earth earlier than did carbon and nitrogen.**: The passage does not provide any information about the timeline of the appearance of water relative to carbon and nitrogen. This statement is not supported by the text.\n   - **C. Its existence in a liquid state is contingent on Earth's orbital parameters.**: This is explicitly stated in the passage, which discusses the narrow orbital parameters necessary for liquid water to exist.\n   - **D. Much of it came from a part of the solar system where water cannot exist in a liquid state.**: The passage does not directly state this, but it suggests that water could have come from comets, which are typically found in regions where water cannot exist in a liquid state. This option is somewhat implied.\n   - **E. It is unlikely that there would be much of it available to support life if the gravitational shield of the outer planets did not limit the frequency with which comets strike Earth.**: This is supported by the passage, which discusses how Jupiter's mass protects Earth from frequent comet bombardment.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - Options A, C, D, and E are all supported by the passage. \n   - Option B is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention the relative timing of the appearance of water, carbon, and nitrogen.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: B\n\n**Explanation**: Option B is correct because the passage does not provide any information about whether water appeared on Earth earlier than carbon and nitrogen.

The passage does not indicate that \"herstory\" is an old term; it suggests that it was coined in the 1970s and 1980s as a new feminist practice.\n   - **C. is controversial within the feminist community**: The passage does not explicitly state that herstory is controversial, although it does mention that it requires revision, which implies some debate but does not confirm widespread controversy.\n   - **D. is not especially useful to scholars**: The passage does not claim that herstory is useless to scholars; rather, it critiques its limitations while acknowledging its role in promoting women's history.\n   - **E. was invented to help make a particular point**: This is correct.
