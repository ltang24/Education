The passage outlines how the study was designed and what it found, particularly how guppies raised in smaller groups learned to locate food more quickly compared to those raised in larger groups.

Option D provides additional evidence because it indicates that young seals are more susceptible to viruses, while the recent deaths were primarily among adult seals. This suggests that if viruses were the primary cause of death, there would likely be more fatalities among the younger, more vulnerable population, which is not the case here.

However, progressive theater critics dismissed it, favoring the New Stagecraft approach that emphasized a more abstract and minimalistic theatrical expression. This contrast suggests a discrepancy between popular tastes, which appreciated Belasco's realism, and the tastes of the progressive critics, who saw his work as merely capturing surface realities.

This is evident in the description of the critics' disdain for theatrical literalism and their preference for a more minimalist approach that captures the essence of the dramatic text rather than its surface realities.

This indicates a shift away from generalizations about loyalist motives and identities, illustrating how modern historians have moved towards a more nuanced understanding of Southern dissent.

This contradicts Gerteis' assertion that, despite their political differences, there was a unified commitment among Northern reformers to utilitarian values, which served to galvanize popular political support for abolitionism.

This contextualizes Gerteis's revival of the 'Growth' interpretation, as he addresses these critiques and emphasizes different aspects of Northern reformer unity without oversimplifying their diversity.

The text states that if an event is the product of multiple factors, then each factor is essential, leading to the conundrum of how one cause can be deemed more indispensable than another.

It states that while she had some celebrity posthumously, much of her brilliance as a writer was overshadowed by her personal reputation, especially in the nineteenth century. This aligns with option A, as it highlights that modern feminism has emphasized the progressive aspects of Wollstonecraft's writings while separating her work from her personal reputation, which had previously been a hinderance to her recognition.",

The passage explicitly mentions that scientists believed interglacials were as mild and uniform as the Holocene has been. The new findings from GRIP challenged this assumption by showing that the climate during the Eemian interglacial fluctuated as wildly as during ice ages, but this was not the previously held belief.

While it does touch on various architectural influences, the correct answer reflects the passage's exploration of how the design and structure of these churches were rooted in a blend of indigenous and Spanish colonial influences, rather than just dealing with traditional Italian architectural attitudes. Specifically, it discusses the adaptation of European church design through the lens of local cultural practices and materials, hinting at a more complex relationship than merely demonstrating a singular attitude towards building materials, as seen in the historical context of the mission churches and their relation to the kiva. Therefore, while the passage contrasts influences on architecture, it does not focus significantly on the attitudes of Renaissance architects towards materials, which is what option E implies.",

This suggests that both painting and architecture of the Baroque era likely share common visual features that express cultural and religious themes. The author highlights the connections between the mission churches and indigenous kivas, indicating an intertwining of cultural artistic expressions, which can be interpreted as visual features having certain similarities.

Historical records indicating that Spanish missionaries consistently expressed a conciliatory attitude toward indigenous religious practices would provide strong evidence supporting the argument that their interactions with the kiva were respectful and integrated rather than dominating.

The \"attempts\" referred to in the passage aim to explain how such massive planets could form at such close distances to their stars, which contradicts traditional theories.
