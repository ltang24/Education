The mention of \"few studies have investigated social learning within a developmental context\" suggests that the researchers were not initially targeting social learning as their primary focus.

The mention of Kennedy's work as a shift away from the naturalistic tradition indicates that her approach introduces new themes that liberate African American identities from external constraints. Therefore, option D accurately encapsulates the central idea that Kennedy's work represents a significant transition away from strict naturalism in African American drama.",

The option that states Kennedy uses characters found only in ancient African legends and mythology most strongly supports the assertion that her work diverges from the traditional naturalistic approach.

The passage specifically addresses the belief among some historians that Mather's biographies are hagiographical and lack historical accuracy. It argues against this view by highlighting the breadth of information Mather provides, his critical observations, and the humor he employs, as well as his concern for the settlers' material prosperity. These points illustrate that Mather's work has value beyond the criticisms levied against it, emphasizing the complexity of his biographical writing rather than simply presenting it as pious or inaccurate.",

Option D supports this conclusion by providing additional context about the vulnerability of young seals to viruses. If nearly all recent deaths were among adult seals, it implies that the adult seals may not be as susceptible to the virus. This reinforces the idea that the observed deaths are more likely attributable to the bacterial toxin, particularly since the passage indicates that both viruses and bacterial toxins can be lethal, but there are differences in susceptibility among seal age groups.

By acknowledging the possibility of isolated boycotts elsewhere, Breen's comment adds nuance to the assertion about the origin of consumer boycotts and suggests that while the North American example was prominent, it was not entirely exclusive. This qualification shows that the argument is not absolute and that other instances did exist, thereby moderating the conclusion drawn about the uniqueness of the American consumer boycott.",

Option A supports the argument by suggesting that if the gravel cargo box is covered, drivers of vehicles following closely behind the gravel trucks may feel more secure and therefore choose to stay closer. This could potentially increase the risk of damage from gravel flying off the tires, rendering the law ineffective.

He suggests that focusing on limitations during chick rearing explains clutch size in these species.

However, it also points out that it is equally possible that the work survived in numerous copies in monastic libraries but went unnoticed due to lack of interest. This implies that additional copies of so-called lone survivor manuscripts may have indeed existed well into the Middle Ages, which directly supports option B.

The passage discusses how Gerteis revives the Growth interpretation by emphasizing the utilitarian values among Northern reformers while acknowledging the political diversity among them. The text implies that Gerteis's arguments effectively challenge previous criticisms of the Growth framework, particularly by maintaining the validity of reformer unity in the 1830s, thus making his formulation more compelling than earlier interpretations.",

However, Gerteis revives this interpretation, suggesting that its basic elements were accepted by the Northern reform community as early as the late 1830s. This indicates that the Growth interpretation has indeed been reformulated and is gaining renewed attention.

This contradicts Gerteis' assertion that there was a unified commitment among Northern reformers to utilitarian values that allowed them to galvanize political support for abolitionism.

This indicates that, prior to the GRIP findings, scientists believed that interglacials were comparatively stable and mild (as reflected in option D), contrasting with the highly variable climate during ice ages. The passage also points out that recent findings from the GRIP core have challenged this notion, revealing that the Eemian interglacial experienced significant climate swings, but that does not change the prior belief explicitly stated in the documentation. Thus, option D accurately captures what scientists believed before the new findings were presented.",

While the focus of the passage is on the Renaissance and Modernist periods, it is reasonable to conclude that the author's analysis of architecture includes the Baroque era as a later stage.

This indicates that although the materials available had a certain natural character (e.g., the massive and solid quality of the Tuscan stone), the architects chose to design in a style that was delicate and graceful, which contrasts with the inherent qualities of the materials. This demonstrates their creative use of materials, rather than allowing those materials to determine the architectural style.",

While it does not explicitly mention painting or Baroque architecture, the implication is that both mission architecture and indigenous forms have visual characteristics that relate to their respective cultural contexts.

The passage states that \"most Spanish missionaries, arriving in the Southwest with little or no military support, wisely adopted a somewhat conciliatory attitude toward the use of the kiva.\" This indicates that missionaries recognized the significance of the kiva in indigenous culture and were not solely focused on imposing their beliefs. If historical records indeed show a consistent conciliatory attitude toward indigenous practices, it would strengthen the assertion that their intent was to highlight rather than diminish the kiva's importance in the mission settlements.

The key issue in these attempts is how to account for hot Jupiters in a manner that doesn’t contradict the standard theory, which generally does not support the formation of such large planets so close to a star. The passage mentions that the hypotheses focus on how a hot Jupiter might have formed farther away and then migrated inward, aligning with the goal of reconciling these planets’ existence with the traditional theory of planetary formation.

Additionally, it discusses \"changes in tree species composition and the consequent alterations of forest structure, productivity, and nutrient uptake\" as long-term effects, which corresponds with option C (changes in forest structure).

Specifically, the passage discusses how different tree species have varied properties, which contributes to changes in species composition and, consequently, alterations in forest structure, productivity, and nutrient uptake. The emphasis on the long-term changes resulting from the interactions between exotic pests and specific tree species indicates that these unique properties are crucial for understanding the pervasive effects of pests on the overall ecosystem. This aligns with option B as it highlights the broader implications of pest impacts on ecosystems as a result of these unique tree properties.",

There is no mention that mahogany has the same level of resistance to rot and pests as teak, making option B the correct choice. Option A refers to compatibility with existing ships, but the passage does not compare teak's compatibility with that of mahogany.

The conclusion drawn is that this does not mean that only biologists already employed by the space program are interested. Option C logically completes this argument by suggesting that there are other scientists (not just biologists) who may also be interested in conducting research in space.
