This suggests that the study was not initially designed to investigate social learning directly, but rather how group density affects foraging success, which can be inferred to relate to social learning.

If the individuals had already experienced a significant decrease in opportunities for social interaction, it could explain both their increased Internet use and their higher incidence of depression, thus undermining the conclusion that increased Internet use directly causes depression.

The passage states that Kennedy's \"surrealistic plays... mark one of the first departures from naturalism by an African American dramatist\" and that her work \"has been to depict the world of the soul and the spirit, not to mirror concrete reality.\" This suggests that Kennedy's work is a shift away from the naturalistic approach that has dominated African American drama.

This suggests that covering cargo boxes wouldn't be a significant change in practice and therefore wouldn't address the root cause of the problem.\n\nHere's why the other options are less strong:\n\n* **A:**  Focuses on driver behavior, not the source of the gravel.\n* **C:**  Downplays the severity of the problem, but doesn't address the core argument.\n* **D:**  Irrelevant to the main point about gravel coming from tire grooves.\n* **E:**  Discusses driving speed, which is not directly related to the passage's argument.",

This assumption is crucial because if many current journalists did not support the Blue Party in their student years, it would undermine the argument that the disparity in political affiliations will increase as students enter the profession.

It emphasizes the difficulties associated with both.\n* **D:** The passage doesn't advocate for one type of evidence over another; instead, it cautions against overreliance on any single source.\n* **E:**  While stemma are discussed, the passage goes beyond simply explaining them. It critiques their limitations and connects them to broader challenges in textual transmission studies. \n\n\nThe passage repeatedly points out the limitations of the available evidence and the need for careful interpretation. For example, it states: \"The number of extant manuscripts, however few, really does not allow scholars to infer how many ancient Latin manuscripts of a work survived to the ninth, the twelfth, or even the fifteenth century,\" and \"Much as scholars want to look for overall patterns and formulate useful generalizations, the transmission of each text is a different story and each manuscript’s history is unique.\"",

Locate the relevant information in the passage**\n\n- The passage discusses a specific study conducted by Chapman, Ward, and Krause on guppies and their social learning in different group densities.\n- It highlights the findings that guppies raised in small groups were better at locating food through social learning compared to those raised in large groups.\n- The passage concludes that the early social environment affects the capacity for social learning in guppies.\n\n  \n\n**3. Evaluate each option based on the passage content**\n\n- **A. note a flaw in a scientific finding**  \n  - This option is incorrect because the passage does not point out a flaw; it presents findings from a study.\n\n- **B. describe a particular scientific study**  \n  - This option is partially correct as the passage describes the study conducted by Chapman, Ward, and Krause. However, it goes beyond mere description.\n\n- **C. present an interpretation of a finding**  \n  - This option is correct because the passage interprets the findings of the study, explaining the implications of the results regarding social learning in guppies.\n\n- **D. note a difference between two scientific findings**  \n  - This option is incorrect as the passage does not compare two different scientific findings; it focuses on one study.\n\n- **E. contrast two conditions in which a particular phenomenon has been observed**  \n  - This option is somewhat correct since the passage contrasts the effects of small and large group densities on social learning. However, it does not capture the primary purpose as effectively as option C.\n\n  \n\n**4.

It highlights that guppies raised in small groups were better at locating food by following trained adults compared to those raised in larger groups, suggesting that the social environment affects social learning.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning.**  \n     - This option is plausible because the passage states that the study investigated the role of group density rather than social learning itself. However, it does not explicitly state that the study was designed for a different purpose, just that it focused on group density.\n   \n   - **B. It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life spans.**  \n     - The passage does not mention observing guppies at multiple life stages; it focuses on the impact of group density during development. This option is not supported by the text.\n   \n   - **C. It pointed to the possibility that population density may have little to do with guppies’ social learning.**  \n     - This option contradicts the findings presented in the passage, which suggest that population density significantly affects social learning in guppies.\n   \n   - **D. It required the observation of guppies under conditions that closely mimicked the conditions of guppies in the wild.**  \n     - The passage describes laboratory conditions, which do not necessarily mimic wild conditions. This option is not supported by the text.\n   \n   - **E. It indicated that guppies gain adaptive information from being reared with a relatively large number of conspecifics.**  \n     - This option is incorrect as the passage indicates the opposite: guppies raised in larger groups were less likely to learn the benefits of social learning and viewed conspecifics as competitors.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - The best inference is **A**, as it aligns with the passage's statement that the study focused on group density rather than social learning itself. While it does not explicitly state that the study was designed for a different purpose, it implies that the primary focus was on group density's effects.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A\n\n**Reasoning**: \n- **A** is correct because the study's focus on group density suggests it was not primarily about social learning, which aligns with the passage's content. \n- **B** is incorrect because the passage does not mention observing guppies over their lifespan.\n- **C** is incorrect because the findings suggest that population density does have a significant impact on social learning.\n- **D** is incorrect as the study was conducted in laboratory conditions, not necessarily mimicking wild conditions.\n- **E** is incorrect because the passage indicates that guppies in larger groups were less likely to learn adaptive behaviors.",

The question is asking for a sentence that suggests a possible reason why Hurston wrote the version of Mules and Men that was published in 1935, rather than the original manuscript.\n\n2. Scanning the passage, the relevant sentences to consider are:\n   - \"Evidently, however, Hurston had prepared another version, a manuscript that was recently discovered and published after having been forgotten since 1929.\"\n   - \"This version differs from Mules and Men in that it simply records stories, with no descriptive or interpretive information.\"\n   - \"While we cannot know for certain why Hurston’s original manuscript went unpublished during her lifetime, it may have been because publishers wanted something more than a transcription of tales.\"\n   - \"In this, Hurston may have been ahead of her time.\"\n\n3. Evaluating these sentences:\n   - The first sentence provides context about the existence of another version but does not suggest a reason for the published version.\n   - The second sentence describes the differences between the two versions but does not imply a reason for the publication choice.\n   - The third sentence directly addresses the potential reason for why the original manuscript was not published, indicating that publishers may have preferred a version that included more than just the stories.\n   - The fourth sentence discusses Hurston's forward-thinking nature but does not provide a reason for the publication of Mules and Men.\n\n4. The most relevant sentence is the third one, as it directly suggests that the reason for Hurston's published version may have been influenced by publishers' preferences.\n\nSELECTED SENTENCE: \"While we cannot know for certain why Hurston’s original manuscript went unpublished during her lifetime, it may have been because publishers wanted something more than a transcription of tales.\"\n\nThis sentence best answers the question because it explicitly suggests that the reason for the publication of Mules and Men in 1935 could be linked to the expectations of publishers, who were looking for more than just a straightforward transcription of stories.

The question asks which statement would most strengthen the author's assertion that Kennedy's work marks a serious departure from the tradition described in the first paragraph. In other words, we need to find an option that supports the idea that Kennedy's work breaks away from the naturalistic tradition of depicting concrete reality.\n\n2. The relevant information in the passage is found in the second paragraph, which states that Kennedy's work \"depicts the world of the soul and the spirit, not to mirror concrete reality.\" This suggests that Kennedy's work is a departure from the naturalistic tradition, which focuses on concrete reality.\n\n3. Let's evaluate each option based on the passage content:\n\nA. Kennedy places the action in a real-life setting that is nevertheless unfamiliar to the average viewer or reader. This option does not necessarily suggest a departure from the naturalistic tradition, as it still involves depicting concrete reality.\n\nB. Kennedy movingly portrays the lives and struggles of prominent African Americans in the United States. This option is consistent with the naturalistic tradition, which focuses on depicting concrete reality.\n\nC. Kennedy uses characters found only in ancient African legends and mythology. This option suggests that Kennedy's work is not bound by the naturalistic tradition, which typically involves depicting contemporary reality. By using characters from ancient legends and mythology, Kennedy's work is more focused on the world of the soul and the spirit, which aligns with the author's assertion.\n\nD. Kennedy provides insights into American mimetic tradition and dramatic convention. This option does not necessarily suggest a departure from the naturalistic tradition, as it still involves analyzing and understanding the tradition.\n\nE. Kennedy depicts the events in a style reminiscent of a television documentary. This option is consistent with the naturalistic tradition, which often involves depicting concrete reality in a realistic style.\n\n4. Based on the passage content, option C is the best answer because it suggests that Kennedy's work is a departure from the naturalistic tradition by using characters from ancient African legends and mythology, which is consistent with the author's assertion. Options A, B, D, and E do not support the author's assertion and can be eliminated.",

In other words, what is the main idea or purpose of the passage?\n\n2. To locate the relevant information in the passage, let's look at the first sentence: \"Although many hypotheses have been proposed to explain why some plant communities are more susceptible than others to invasion by nonnative species, results from field studies have been inconsistent and no general theory of invasibility has yet emerged.\" This sentence sets the tone for the rest of the passage, which discusses the lack of a general theory to explain invasibility.\n\n3. Evaluating each option:\n   A. Assessing the empirical success of a theory: The passage does mention a theory, but it doesn't assess its empirical success. Instead, it proposes a new theory.\n   B. Explaining why no consistent theoretical account of a phenomenon has been possible: The passage does explain why no general theory has emerged, but this is not its primary concern.\n   C. Advocating a potential solution to a theoretical impasse: The passage presents a new theory that could resolve many of the conflicting results of previous studies. This is the main idea of the passage.\n   D. Deducing testable predictions from a proposed theory: The passage does mention some predictions, but this is not its primary focus.\n   E. Describing the difficulties involved in explaining certain empirical results: While the passage does mention some difficulties, this is not its primary concern.\n\n4. Eliminating incorrect options and selecting the best answer:\n   Based on the analysis, options A, B, D, and E are not the primary concern of the passage. Option C, advocating a potential solution to a theoretical impasse, best captures the main idea of the passage.\n\nThe passage primarily presents a new theory that could resolve the inconsistencies in previous studies, making option C the correct answer.",

In the passage, the relevant information regarding factors leading to temperature swings includes:\n   - The reflective nature of snow and ice, and how their melting exposes soil that absorbs heat.\n   - The thinness of the polar atmosphere, which requires less energy to warm.\n   - The comparison of energy loss due to evaporation at the poles versus the tropics.\n\n3. Now, let's evaluate each option:\n   - **A. the amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles**: The passage states that less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the poles than in the tropics, but it does not directly indicate that this is a factor leading to temperature swings. Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\n   - **B. soil exposure due to melting snow**: The passage clearly states that when snow and ice melt, the exposed soil absorbs heat, which accelerates warming. This is directly mentioned as a factor contributing to temperature swings. Thus, this option is supported by the passage.\n   - **C. the relatively thin atmosphere at the poles**: The passage mentions that the polar atmosphere is thin, requiring little energy to warm it. This is also directly indicated as a factor contributing to temperature swings. Therefore, this option is supported by the passage.\n\n4.

The question is asking for the primary concern of the author in the second paragraph of the passage, specifically regarding the formation of the Earth-Moon system.\n\n2. The relevant information in the passage discusses the consequences of collisions between bodies of comparable size, particularly highlighting a significant collision between Earth and a Mars-size impactor that may have resulted in the formation of the Moon.\n\n3. Evaluating each option:\n   - A. **Arguing in favor of a particular theory about the formation of the Earth-Moon system.** This option suggests that the author is taking a stance on a specific theory. However, the passage does not explicitly argue for a theory; it merely presents a scenario that could explain the Moon's formation.\n   - B. **Summarizing conventional theories about the formation of the Earth-Moon system.** The passage does not summarize multiple theories; it focuses on one specific event (the collision) that may have led to the Moon's formation.\n   - C. **Anticipating and responding to criticisms of a particular theory about the formation of the Earth-Moon system.** The passage does not address criticisms or counterarguments; it simply presents information about the collision.\n   - D. **Explaining why the Earth-Moon system is considered scientifically perplexing.** The passage does not discuss perplexities or challenges regarding the Earth-Moon system; it presents a straightforward explanation of a potential formation scenario.\n   - E. **Questioning an assumption underlying one theory about the formation of the Earth-Moon system.** The passage does not question any assumptions; it describes a possible event without challenging any existing theories.\n\n4. Based on the evaluations, the best answer is **A**, as the passage describes a significant collision theory that may explain the Moon's formation, which implies an argument in favor of that theory.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A\n\nReasoning: The passage primarily discusses a specific collision event that could explain the formation of the Earth-Moon system, which aligns with option A. The other options either misinterpret the author's intent or do not accurately reflect the content of the passage. The author is not summarizing, responding to criticisms, or questioning assumptions; rather, they are presenting a theory regarding the Moon's formation.",

It also mentions that while herstory was a rallying cry for feminist historians, it inadvertently obscured the contributions of women to historical discourse prior to the nineteenth century.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. was popular mainly in the nineteenth century**: This is incorrect. The passage states that herstory emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, not the nineteenth century.\n   - **B. is an old term that feminists put to new uses**: This is misleading. The passage does not indicate that \"herstory\" was an old term; it suggests that it was coined in the 1970s and 1980s.\n   - **C. is controversial within the feminist community**: The passage does not explicitly state that herstory is controversial; it discusses its limitations but does not indicate a division within the feminist community regarding its use.\n   - **D. is not especially useful to scholars**: The passage does not claim that herstory is not useful to scholars; it critiques its limitations but does not dismiss its utility.\n   - **E. was invented to help make a particular point**: This option aligns with the passage's assertion that herstory was created as a compensatory feminist practice to highlight women's contributions to history.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: Based on the analysis, options A, B, C, and D can be eliminated. Option E is the best answer as it accurately reflects the purpose of the term \"herstory\" as described in the passage.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: E\n\n**Explanation**: The choice of E is correct because the passage explicitly states that herstory was a term coined to create a narrative centered on women's contributions to history, thus making a particular point about the need for female-centered accounts. The other options either misinterpret the passage or present information that is not supported by the text.",

The relevant information about Mary Astell can be found in the second half of the passage, specifically in the paragraphs discussing her and her work.\n3. Evaluating each option:\n   A. The passage does not mention that Astell was representative of the intellectual interests of woman historians of her time. This option is not supported by the text.\n   B. The passage does not mention that Astell inspired many practitioners of herstory in the twentieth century. This option is not supported by the text.\n   C. The passage states that Astell \"must be credited for admirable zeal in setting out to right scholarly wrongs, but her supposition that historians were only male is inaccurate.\" This suggests that Astell shared with modern herstorians a mistaken assumption regarding the writing of history, making this option correct.\n   D. The passage does not mention that Astell's major work aroused much controversy at the time of its publication. This option is not supported by the text.\n   E. The passage does not mention that Astell's major work still has not received the attention from scholars that it deserves. This option is not supported by the text.\n4. Eliminating incorrect options and selecting the best answer, option C is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the passage's description of Astell's mistaken assumption about the writing of history.\n\nThe passage portrays Astell as a pioneering feminist who, despite her courage and rightful anger, held an inaccurate view about the male dominance in historiography. This makes option C the best answer, as it highlights the specific aspect of Astell's work and ideas that the passage emphasizes.",

Identify what the question is asking for**\n\nThe question is asking for an implication about Astell’s supposition regarding the historical contributions of women, as discussed in the passage. \n\n**2. Locate the relevant information in the passage**\n\n- The passage discusses Astell's belief that historians were predominantly male and that they neglected women's contributions.\n- It mentions that Astell herself wrote a historical work, which suggests she was aware of women's contributions but still held a flawed perception.\n- The author notes that Astell's judgment is understandable given the context of historical writing by women being published later.\n\n**3. Evaluate each option based on the passage content**\n\n- **A. It is likely to have arisen because of Astell’s unawareness of much of the historical work written by women.**\n  - This option aligns with the passage's implication that Astell's view was limited due to the lack of visibility of women's historical contributions at the time.\n\n- **B. It was one that Astell reconsidered after she wrote her own historical work.**\n  - The passage does not indicate that Astell reconsidered her views after writing her work; it simply states that she wrote one.\n\n- **C. It was one that was not shared by other feminist historians of Astell’s time.**\n  - The passage does not provide evidence that other feminist historians disagreed with Astell's view; it focuses on her perspective.\n\n- **D. It was one that inspired Astell to write her own historical work.**\n  - While Astell's beliefs may have motivated her, the passage does not explicitly state that her supposition inspired her writing.\n\n- **E.

Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**\n\n- **B, C, D, and E** can be eliminated based on the passage's content and implications.\n- **A** is the best answer as it accurately reflects the author's implication regarding Astell's limited awareness of women's historical contributions.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: A\n\n**Explanation of Reasoning**\n\n- **Correct Choice (A)**: This option is correct because the passage implies that Astell's belief stemmed from a lack of awareness of women's historical contributions, which aligns with the author's critique of her perception.\n  \n- **Incorrect Choices**:\n  - **B** is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Astell reconsidered her views after writing her work.\n  - **C** is incorrect as the passage does not provide evidence that other feminist historians disagreed with Astell.\n  - **D** is incorrect because the passage does not state that her supposition inspired her to write her historical work.\n  - **E** is incorrect because while Astell's view is flawed, it does not directly contradict the claims of herstory; rather, it highlights a misunderstanding.",
