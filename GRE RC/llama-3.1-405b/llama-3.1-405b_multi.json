This implies that the study was not initially designed to investigate social learning directly, but rather how group density affects foraging success, which can be linked to social learning.

For this argument to hold, it must be assumed that using the Internet does not provide opportunities for face-to-face social interaction. \n\n- **Option A** suggests that the reason for increased Internet use is unrelated to a decrease in social contact, which does not directly support the argument about the relationship between Internet use and depression.\n  \n- **Option B** states that a decrease in face-to-face contact is the only factor leading to increased depression, which is too strong and not necessary for the argument to be valid.\n\n- **Option D** discusses the effects of reducing Internet use on mood, which is not relevant to the argument's focus on increased Internet use leading to depression.\n\n- **Option E** implies that those who increased their Internet use were already more prone to depression, which could weaken the argument rather than support it.\n\n**Option C** is the correct assumption because it directly supports the idea that increased Internet use replaces face-to-face interactions, leading to a higher incidence of depression. If using the Internet did allow for face-to-face social contact, the argument would not hold as strongly. Thus, the assumption that using the Internet does not provide opportunities for face-to-face contact is crucial for the argument's validity.",

This theory aims to integrate existing hypotheses and resolve conflicting results from previous studies. The phrase \"apparently conflicting and ambiguous results\" implies that the theory can explain how different circumstances (such as varying resource availability) can lead to different outcomes regarding invasibility. Therefore, option A, which states that the theory explains how a particular circumstance can produce disparate effects, aligns with the author's argument that fluctuating resource availability can clarify the inconsistencies in previous research findings.",

The amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles is mentioned as a factor, stating that \"less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics.\" This indicates that the lower energy loss contributes to temperature increases.\n\nB. Soil exposure due to melting snow is also mentioned. The passage explains that \"if snow and ice melt, the exposed soil, which absorbs heat, serves to accelerate warming.\" This clearly indicates that melting snow and ice leads to greater temperature swings.\n\nC. The relatively thin atmosphere at the poles is another factor discussed in the passage. It states that \"the polar atmosphere is thin, so little energy is required to warm it,\" suggesting that this thin atmosphere contributes to the temperature changes.\n\nThus, all three options (A, B, and C) are correct as they are explicitly mentioned in the passage as factors leading to temperature swings in the polar regions.",

Option A states that drivers of vehicles behind a gravel truck are more likely to remain close behind the truck if the truck’s cargo box is covered than if it is uncovered. If this is true, it implies that the presence of a tarpaulin might encourage closer following distances, which could lead to more vehicles being affected by gravel flying off the tires rather than the cargo box.

Therefore, those who believe in the high costs of egg production would not primarily agree with options B or C.\n\n- Options D and E also do not align with the perspective of those who view egg production as costly, as they focus on factors unrelated to the energetic or nutritional demands of egg production itself.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A, as it directly reflects the belief that egg production is costly in terms of nutritional and energy demands.",

This can lead scholars to underestimate the true extent of the connections between certain manuscripts, as it implies that they are more closely related than they might be due to their historical separation in time and place.",

By providing this evidence, the sentence reinforces the idea that similar advocacy existed in Ireland prior to the American example, thus aligning with the perception cited at the beginning of the passage.",

It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning.**  \n     This option is plausible because the passage mentions that the study focused on group density and its effect on foraging success, which could imply a broader scope than just social learning. However, it does not explicitly state that the study was designed for a different purpose.\n   \n   - **B. It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life spans.**  \n     The passage does not mention the observation of individual guppies over their life spans; it focuses on the impact of group density during development. This option is not supported by the text.\n   \n   - **C.

Mather’s descriptions of the Massachusetts Bay colonists were based primarily on firsthand experiences.** \n     - The passage does not provide evidence that Mather's descriptions were based primarily on firsthand experiences; it focuses on the breadth of information and documents he used.\n   - **D. Many historians believe that Mather’s biographies are poor sources of historical information because biography is an inherently unreliable genre of historical writing.** \n     - The passage mentions that some historians view Mather's work as hagiography but does not generalize that biography is inherently unreliable.\n   - **E.

Specifically, it wants to know what this term signifies in relation to feminist literary criticism of Fanny Fern.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant information in the passage**: The passage discusses how feminist scholars have re-evaluated Fanny Fern's work, moving away from the traditional view of her as merely sentimental and instead highlighting her sharp social criticism. The term \"reclamations\" is used to describe this process of re-evaluating and reclaiming Fern's literary contributions.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - A. **reformations**: This implies a change or improvement, but it doesn't capture the idea of recovering or rediscovering something that was undervalued.\n   - B. **rehabilitations**: This suggests restoring something to a good condition or reputation, which aligns well with the idea of feminist scholars restoring Fern's reputation and significance.\n   - C. **recapitulations**: This means summarizing or repeating something, which does not fit the context of re-evaluating or reclaiming.\n   - D. **retractions**: This means withdrawing or taking back something said or written, which is the opposite of what is meant by \"reclamations.\"\n   - E. **reiterations**: This means repeating something, which does not convey the sense of reclaiming or restoring significance.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: The best option is B, \"rehabilitations,\" as it accurately reflects the process of feminist scholars restoring Fanny Fern's literary significance and reputation. The other options either do not fit the context or convey a meaning contrary to the intended sense of \"reclamations.\"\n\nFINAL ANSWER: B\n\n**Explanation**: The choice of \"rehabilitations\" is correct because it captures the essence of what feminist scholars are doing with Fanny Fern's work—they are restoring her reputation and significance in literary criticism. The other options do not convey this idea effectively: \"reformations\" suggests improvement without the connotation of recovery, \"recapitulations\" and \"reiterations\" imply repetition rather than reclamation, and \"retractions\" suggests withdrawal rather than restoration. Thus, B is the most accurate synonym in this context.",

There is no expense associated with operating an automobile that is higher when the automobile uses the plant-based fuel than when it uses gasoline.** \n     - This is a reasonable assumption because if there were higher operating costs with the plant-based fuel, the argument about saving money would not hold.\n   - **B. Automobiles that have been operated using the plant-based fuel can no longer be operated using regular gasoline.** \n     - This is not an assumption of the argument. The passage does not imply that cars can only use one type of fuel.\n   - **C. The environmental damage attributable to automobiles is due almost entirely to the production and combustion of fuel automobiles use.** \n     - While this may be true, the passage does not explicitly state this and does not rely on it for the argument about the benefits of the new fuel.\n   - **D. The advantages of the plant-based fuel over gasoline will not lead those who switch to the plant-based fuel to do more driving.** \n     - This is not an assumption.

It mentions that some biologists theorize that egg production is energetically or nutritionally demanding, which implies that they would likely view clutch size as being influenced by these costs.

It also mentions that different factors may influence clutch size in altricial and precocial species.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **Option A**: \"In altricial species, clutch size is determined primarily by factors operating after eggs are laid.\" This aligns with the passage, which states that studies focused on limitations during chick rearing in altricial species, suggesting that clutch size is indeed influenced by factors after the eggs are laid.\n   - **Option B**: \"In precocial species, clutch size is determined primarily by factors operating after eggs are laid.\" The passage indicates that Lack recognized different factors for precocial species, such as food availability for egg-laying females, which suggests that factors before laying may be more significant. Therefore, this option does not align with Lack's views.\n   - **Option C**: \"In many bird species, clutch size generally remains well below the potential limit of egg production.\" This statement is consistent with Lack's theory, as he suggested that clutch size is below the potential limit of egg production.

One important function of these dams is to protect beavers' homes.** This is supported by the passage, which states that dams help deal with variations in water levels and protect lodge entrances.\n   - **B. Most are built prior to burrow construction.** The passage does not provide any information about the timing of dam construction relative to burrow construction, so this cannot be supported.\n   - **C. They are found mostly along deep rivers.** The passage mentions that bank beavers are found along deep rivers but does not state that dams are mostly found there, so this is not supported.\n   - **D. They are routinely abandoned as nearby forests are depleted.** The passage does not mention abandonment of dams or relate it to forest depletion, so this is not supported.\n   - **E.

The question is asking which statement is true regarding the collisions mentioned in the highlighted sentence, specifically focusing on the characteristics of those collisions.\n\n2. The relevant information in the passage describes two types of collisions: \n   - Collisions involving massive projectiles striking larger bodies, which create craters and result in the complete destruction of the impacting body.\n   - Collisions between bodies of comparable size, which can lead to one or both bodies being smashed and mass being redistributed among new objects formed from the fragments.\n\n3. Now, let's evaluate each option based on the passage content:\n   - A. They occur less frequently than do titanic collisions. \n     - The passage does not provide information about the frequency of these collisions compared to titanic collisions, so we cannot confirm this statement.\n   - B. They occur between bodies of comparable size. \n     - This statement is true as the passage explicitly states that collisions between bodies of comparable size have different consequences than those involving massive projectiles and larger bodies.\n   - C. They occur primarily between planet-sized bodies. \n     - The passage does not specify that these collisions occur primarily between planet-sized bodies; it focuses on bodies of comparable size, which could be smaller than planet-sized.\n   - D. They result in the complete destruction of the impacting body. \n     - This statement is incorrect for the collisions between bodies of comparable size, as the passage indicates that one or both bodies might be smashed, but does not guarantee complete destruction of the impacting body.\n   - E.

However, since the question asks for which of the following is true of the collisions mentioned in the highlighted sentence, and the highlighted sentence specifically refers to collisions between bodies of comparable size, option B is the most directly relevant and specific to that context.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: B\n\nReasoning: Option B is correct because it accurately reflects the nature of the collisions discussed in the highlighted sentence, which specifically involves bodies of comparable size.

Scanning the first paragraph, I will look for sentences that discuss the relationships between manuscripts and how scholars might misinterpret these relationships.\n\n3. The relevant sentences in the first paragraph include:\n   - \"If surviving copies are few, the stemma perforce brings into proximity manuscripts that were widely separated in time and place of origin.\"\n   - \"Conversely, the stemma can also bestow a semblance of separation on manuscripts written within a few months of one another or even in the same room.\"\n\n4. Evaluating these sentences:\n   - The first sentence suggests that when there are few surviving copies, manuscripts that are actually far apart in time and place may appear closely related, which could lead to an underestimation of their true separation.\n   - The second sentence indicates that manuscripts that are actually close in time may appear more distant, which could also lead to an underestimation of their connections.\n\nThe first sentence is more directly related to the idea of underestimating connections because it explicitly mentions that few surviving copies can misrepresent the proximity of manuscripts.\n\nSELECTED SENTENCE: \"If surviving copies are few, the stemma perforce brings into proximity manuscripts that were widely separated in time and place of origin.\"\n\nThis sentence best answers the question because it clearly articulates how the scarcity of surviving manuscripts can lead scholars to mistakenly perceive closer relationships between manuscripts that are actually quite distant in their origins. This directly addresses the concern of underestimating the extent of connections between certain manuscripts.",

It could have occurred if Earth's orbit were 1 percent larger than it is but not if Earth's orbit were 5 percent smaller.**  \n   This option misrepresents the passage. The passage states that if Earth's orbit were 5 percent smaller, temperatures would have been too high for liquid water, and if it were 1 percent larger, it could lead to runaway glaciation. Thus, it implies that both scenarios would be detrimental to life, not that life could develop under the 1 percent larger condition.\n   \n   - **C.
