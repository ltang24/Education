The authors provide an explanation for this finding, suggesting that the early social environment influences the capacity for social learning in guppies.

These factors are:\n\n- The amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles (A): The text states, \"less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics.\" This indicates that the reduced evaporation at the poles leads to a greater retention of solar energy, contributing to temperature swings.\n\n- Soil exposure due to melting snow (B): The passage explains, \"if snow and ice melt, the exposed soil, which absorbs heat, serves to accelerate warming.\" Here, the exposure of soil due to melting snow and ice is directly linked to increased temperature.\n\n- The relatively thin atmosphere at the poles (C): It is stated that, \"the polar atmosphere is thin, so little energy is required to warm it.\" This suggests that the thin atmosphere at the poles makes it easier for temperatures to fluctuate, as less energy is needed to cause significant changes.\n\nTherefore, all three options (A, B, and C) are correct and applicable to the factors mentioned in the passage.",

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the critics' perspective, as it suggests that theatrical productions employing the minimalism of modern painting may better convey a play's central ideas and, thus, have greater appeal to modern audiences.

By drawing on ancient African legends and mythology, Kennedy creates a world that is not bound by the constraints of concrete reality, which is a key aspect of naturalism. This choice of characters and setting allows Kennedy to explore the world of the soul and spirit, a departure from the mechanistic and materialistic conception of humanity typically found in naturalistic drama. It liberates African American minds and souls from their connections to the external environment, a theme that contrasts with the naturalistic tradition's focus on individuals being controlled by their environment.",

Option C is also not suitable as the passage does not present an interpretation of a finding but rather states a scientific observation and its potential implications. Option D can be eliminated as the passage does not contrast two scientific findings but rather presents one study and its outcomes.

Option A suggests that research on the role of conspecifics in fish learning is a recent development, but the passage does not provide any temporal context to support this claim.

This indicates that the study was initially designed to investigate social learning, as the guppies' ability to learn from observing others was being tested. \n\nOption A is correct because the study's initial design was to investigate social learning, and this is supported by the passage's content. \n\nOption B is incorrect as the passage does not mention observing guppies at multiple points in their lifespans. Option C is also incorrect as the study's findings suggest that population density does have an effect on guppies' social learning capacity. Option D is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention observing guppies in conditions that mimic the wild. Option E is incorrect as the study found that guppies reared in high-density situations were less likely to learn from social interactions, suggesting that a large number of conspecifics may hinder, rather than enhance, social learning. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",

The argument in the passage is that increased Internet use can cause depression because time spent online cannot be spent in face-to-face social contact. The studies mentioned in the passage support this argument by showing a higher incidence of depression among those who doubled their Internet use.\n\nOption A is the correct answer because it addresses the potential confounding factor of a decrease in face-to-face social contact leading to increased Internet use. If people doubled their Internet use because they had fewer opportunities for social contact, this could be a reason for the higher incidence of depression, rather than the increased Internet use itself. The passage does not provide information to rule out this possibility, so it is an assumption on which the argument depends.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not claim that a sharp decrease in face-to-face social contact is the only change that can lead to depression. It specifically mentions that a decrease in social contact can precipitate depression, but other factors could also contribute.\n\nOption C is also incorrect, as it is not necessary for the argument to be valid. The passage does not claim that using the Internet prevents face-to-face social contact; it simply states that time spent online cannot be spent in social contact. This does not preclude the possibility of online activities that enhance social contact.\n\nOption D is not the correct answer because it is a prediction about the effect of decreasing Internet use on mood, which is beyond the scope of the argument in the passage. The passage focuses on the relationship between increased Internet use and depression, not the reverse.\n\nOption E is incorrect because, like option D, it makes an assumption about the motivation for increased Internet use, which is not addressed in the passage.

In contrast, Kennedy's goal is to depict the \"world of the soul and the spirit,\" which implies an internal, rather than external, focus. This aligns with option A, as it suggests that Kennedy is concerned with portraying the inner lives and thoughts of her characters, rather than their external circumstances or the environment. \n\nOptions B, C, D, and E can be eliminated because they do not accurately reflect the passage's description of Kennedy's work. Option B, for instance, refers to the \"madness of reality,\" which is mentioned in the passage as something that African American heroes might declare, but it is not the focus of Kennedy's work. Option C is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the effects of materialism on African American minds and souls; instead, it mentions a \"mechanistic, materialistic conception of humanity\" as a feature of naturalism, which Kennedy's work moves away from. Option D is not a precise description of Kennedy's concern, as it suggests a direct relationship between naturalism and the human spirit, which the passage does not support.

This belief is further supported by the claim that Mather endows his subjects with saintly piety at the expense of historical accuracy. The passage then goes on to describe how Mather's work provides valuable insights into colonial life, including his critical observations of leading figures and his detailed descriptions of events, which demonstrate a more nuanced and realistic portrayal of the settlers. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Mather's biographies disclose important historical data from private diaries. Option C is partially correct as it acknowledges the multifaceted nature of Mather's subjects, but it does not capture the primary belief of historians, which is that Mather glorifies the colonists. Option D is also incorrect as the passage does not indicate any explicit discussion of the salutary effects of religious practices on colonial life.

It mentions the presence of an unidentified virus and a known bacterial toxin in postmortem analysis, with seawater samples revealing high concentrations of the toxic bacterium in the area where the seals died. The conclusion drawn is that the bacterial toxin is the more likely cause of the deaths. \n\nTo support this conclusion, option C provides the most relevant and direct evidence.

Option B, while it may narrow down the potential causes, does not provide any additional evidence to support the conclusion. Option D could be a potential red herring, as it suggests a different cause of death (viruses) for a different group of seals (young seals), which is not relevant to the conclusion drawn in the passage.

Identify what the question is asking for:\nThe question asks us to infer Tompkins' stance on the critics mentioned in the passage. We need to find out what Tompkins' view is and how it relates to the critics' characterization of Fanny Fern's writing.\n\n2. Locate the relevant information in the passage:\nThe passage discusses the critical reception of Fanny Fern's work before and after the emergence of feminist literary criticism. It mentions that critics viewed Fern as a sentimental writer, associating her with weepy, insipid, and conventional themes. In contrast, feminist scholars emphasize her nonsentimental qualities, particularly her social criticism. \n\nTompkins' view is introduced in the last sentence of the passage: \"Tompkins proposes an alternative view of sentimentality itself, suggesting that sentimental writing could serve radical, rather than only conservative ends by swaying readers emotionally, moving them to embrace social change.\"\n\n3. Evaluate each option based on the passage content:\n- Option A: The critics' characterization of Fern's work as sentimental does not necessarily align with the overall result she aims to achieve. Tompkins' view suggests that sentimentality can have a radical impact, which contradicts the critics' assumption.\n- Option B: The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether the critics are as dismissive of Fern as some feminist critics have suggested.\n- Option C: Tompkins' view challenges the idea that sentimentality is inherently conservative. Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\n- Option D: The passage does not indicate that the critics assume \"sentimental\" to be a pejorative term.\n- Option E: This option aligns with Tompkins' view, as she suggests that sentimental rhetoric can indeed sway readers' emotions and promote social change.\n\n4.

Lack's contribution to this debate is then outlined: he suggested that clutch size is not a reflection of the bird's biological limit of egg production but rather is influenced by the number of young the parents can successfully rear. This idea is supported by the subsequent focus of most studies on limitations during chick rearing, especially in altricial species. Lack's recognition of the potential influence of different factors, such as food availability, on clutch size in precocial species further reinforces his initial suggestion. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that factors operating after eggs are laid primarily determine clutch size in altricial species. While the passage does mention that most studies have focused on limitations during chick rearing, it does not explicitly state that these factors are the primary determinants of clutch size. Option B is also incorrect for similar reasons; the passage does not explicitly state that factors operating after eggs are laid primarily determine clutch size in precocial species. \n\nOption C is the correct answer because it aligns with Lack's initial suggestion that clutch size is influenced by the number of young the parents can successfully rear, rather than being a reflection of the bird's biological limit of egg production.

In contrast, Peterson views these women as fundamentally estranged from the nation due to a dominant culture and a Black intelligentsia that fails to recognize the intellect of Black women. This estrangement is a result of the male-dominated Black intelligentsia's focus on race concerns, which leaves little room for the recognition of Black female intellect. \n\nOptions B and C are not supported by the passage. Option B refers to discriminatory attitudes faced by Black women in general, which is a broader issue than what is specifically mentioned in the passage, which focuses on the attitudes of the Black intelligentsia. Option C, while it hints at internal disagreements among Black women, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage and is therefore not a correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, as it directly relates to the passage's description of the male-dominated Black intelligentsia's attitudes towards female intellectual work.",

This option aligns with the passage's caution against overinterpreting the limited evidence available. \n\nOptions A and C, while not incorrect in themselves, are not directly supported by the specific information provided in the passage. Option A discusses the possibility of fewer manuscripts being destroyed by barbarians, which is a valid point but is not the main focus of the passage. Option C implies a direct correlation between a medieval author quoting an ancient Roman text and the survival of that text into the Middle Ages, which the passage does not explicitly state.",

It suggests that when there are few surviving copies of a text, the stemma codicum, which diagrams the relationships between manuscripts, may bring together manuscripts that were originally separated by time and place. This could lead scholars to underestimate the extent of the connection between these manuscripts, as they may appear more closely related than they actually are.",

It emphasizes the role of Jupiter in preventing comet impacts on Earth and the subsequent implications for the development of complex life forms. \n\nOption A is correct because the mention of Mars' oscillating tilt provides evidence for the potential effects of cometary impacts on planetary development. The passage states that Jupiter's mass prevents comets from reaching the inner solar system, and without this shield, Earth would have experienced much more frequent comet impacts, potentially hindering the development of complex life. \n\nOptions B, C, D, and E are incorrect because they do not align with the context or purpose of the mention of Mars' tilt.

It was conveyed to Earth by comets.\nThis option is not supported by the passage. While the passage mentions the role of Jupiter in preventing comet-sized impactors from reaching Earth, it does not explicitly state that comets brought water to Earth. The passage focuses more on the role of Jupiter's mass in shielding Earth from comets, which is related to the development of complex life forms.\n\nB. It appeared on Earth earlier than did carbon and nitrogen.\nThe passage does not provide any information about the relative timing of the appearance of water, carbon, and nitrogen on Earth. Therefore, this option cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given text.\n\nC. Its existence in a liquid state is contingent on Earth's orbital parameters.\nThe passage clearly states that Earth's orbital parameters, specifically the distance from the Sun, are crucial for maintaining temperatures that allow water to exist in a liquid state. This option is supported by the text.\n\nD. Much of it came from a part of the solar system where water cannot exist in a liquid state.\nSimilar to option B, the passage does not provide any information about the origin of Earth's water or whether it came from a region where water cannot exist in a liquid state. Thus, this option cannot be confirmed or refuted.\n\nE. It is unlikely that there would be much of it available to support life if the gravitational shield of the outer planets did not limit the frequency with which comets strike Earth.\nThe passage discusses the role of Jupiter's mass in preventing comet bombardment, which is essential for the development of complex life forms. It suggests that without this shield, the frequency of comet strikes would be much higher, potentially sterilizing Earth's surface or making it difficult for advanced life forms to survive. This option is consistent with the passage's content.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, as it is the only option that cannot be supported by the information provided in the passage.",
