The passage suggests that the increase in Internet usage correlates with a decrease in face-to-face interactions, which is a key point in supporting the psychologists' speculation.

However, the passage does not provide any information about the models being tested, conclusive, or definitive.

It suggests that while scholars often assume that many manuscripts were destroyed by barbarians, it is equally plausible that these works survived in numerous copies in monastic libraries but went unnoticed due to lack of interest.

It explains a counterintuitive finding and provides an interpretation of the results.\n\n3. Evaluate each option based on the passage content:\n   A. note a flaw in a scientific finding: The passage does not mention any flaws in the study, but rather presents and interprets the results.\n   B. describe a particular scientific study: While the passage does describe a study, it is not the primary purpose of the passage.\n   C. present an interpretation of a finding: The passage presents an interpretation of the study's results, explaining why guppies reared in high-density situations may be less likely to learn from others.\n   D. note a difference between two scientific findings: The passage does not compare two separate findings, but rather presents a single study and its results.\n   E. contrast two conditions in which a particular phenomenon has been observed: While the passage does compare two conditions (high-density and low-density), it is not the primary purpose of the passage.\n\n4. Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer: Based on the analysis, option C is the best answer because the passage primarily presents an interpretation of the study's results.\n\nThe passage is written in a formal and objective tone, typical of scientific writing.

Evaluate each option based on the passage content**\n\n- **A.** Research studies of the acquisition of important skills by fish have only recently begun to document the role of conspecifics in the learning process.\n  - **Evaluation:** The passage does not specify that studies have only recently begun; it states that few studies have investigated this aspect. This option is too strong.\n\n- **B.** Research on social learning in guppies suggests that guppies differ in important ways from most other fish in the means by which they learn particular skills.\n  - **Evaluation:** The passage does not compare guppies to other fish in terms of learning methods, so this option is not supported.\n\n- **C.** Research on social learning in fish has generally focused on the acquisition of skills other than foraging.\n  - **Evaluation:** The passage specifically discusses foraging in guppies, contradicting this option.\n\n- **D.** Research has established that social learning occurs in some fish species without investigating the development context in which it occurs.\n  - **Evaluation:** The passage states that social learning is documented but emphasizes the lack of studies on the developmental context, making this option plausible.\n\n- **E.** Research to investigate social learning has been done more extensively on fish than on other aquatic animals.\n  - **Evaluation:** The passage does not compare the extent of research on fish versus other aquatic animals, making this option unsupported.\n\n  \n\n**4.

The relevant information in the passage is that Chapman, Ward, and Krause investigated the role of group density during development in later foraging success in laboratory-housed guppies. The passage also mentions that their study found that guppies reared in high-density situations were less likely to learn the benefits of social learning because they may view conspecifics as competitors rather than as potential sources of adaptive information.\n\n3. Evaluating each option:\n   A. It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning. **This option is supported by the passage**, which states that Chapman, Ward, and Krause investigated the role of group density during development in later foraging success, rather than the development of a particular skill or social learning itself.\n   B. It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life spans. **This option is not supported by the passage**, which mentions that the study was conducted in a laboratory setting with guppies raised in different group densities.\n   C. It pointed to the possibility that population density may have little to do with guppies’ social learning. **This option is not supported by the passage**, which actually suggests that population density may have a significant effect on guppies' social learning.\n   D. It required the observation of guppies under conditions that closely mimicked the conditions of guppies in the wild. **This option is not supported by the passage**, which mentions that the study was conducted in a laboratory setting.\n   E. It indicated that guppies gain adaptive information from being reared with a relatively large number of conspecifics. **This option is not supported by the passage**, which actually suggests that guppies reared in high-density situations (i.e., with a relatively large number of conspecifics) were less likely to learn the benefits of social learning.\n\n4.

In other words, we need to identify a premise or a condition that is not explicitly stated in the passage but is necessary for the argument to hold true.\n\n2. The relevant information in the passage is the claim that sharply increasing Internet use can cause depression, and the finding that regular Internet users who had recently doubled their Internet use had a significantly higher incidence of depression than those whose use had not increased.\n\n3. Let's evaluate each option based on the passage content:\n\nA. In general, the reason that the people in the studies had doubled their Internet use was not that they had earlier experienced a significant decrease in opportunities for face-to-face social contact. This option is a plausible assumption because the passage suggests that a decrease in face-to-face social contact can lead to depression, and it's possible that the people in the studies increased their Internet use for other reasons. However, the passage doesn't provide any information about the motivations behind the increase in Internet use.\n\nB. A sharp decrease in face-to-face social contact is the only change in daily activity that can lead to an increased incidence of depression. This option is not supported by the passage, which only mentions face-to-face social contact as one possible cause of depression.\n\nC. Using the Internet presents no opportunities for people to increase the amount of face-to-face social contact they experienced in their daily lives. This option is not supported by the passage, which doesn't discuss the potential benefits of using the Internet for social contact.\n\nD. Regular Internet users who are depressed will experience an immediate improvement in mood if they sharply decrease the amount of time they spend on the Internet. This option is not supported by the passage, which only discusses the correlation between increased Internet use and depression, not the effects of reducing Internet use.\n\nE. Before they doubled the time they spent on the Internet, the people who did so were already more prone to depression than are regular Internet users in general. This option is not supported by the passage, which doesn't provide any information about the mental health of the people before they increased their Internet use.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, option A is the most plausible assumption on which the argument depends. The passage suggests that a decrease in face-to-face social contact can lead to depression, and it's possible that the people in the studies increased their Internet use for other reasons, not necessarily because they had experienced a decrease in face-to-face social contact.",

The question is asking for the reason why the theory based on fluctuating resource availability might resolve the \"apparently conflicting and ambiguous results\" of previous studies.\n\n2. The relevant information in the passage is in the first paragraph: \"However, a theory based on fluctuating resource availability could integrate most existing hypotheses and successfully resolve many of the apparently conflicting and ambiguous results of previous studies.\"\n\n3. Evaluating each option:\n   A. It explains how a particular circumstance can produce disparate effects. This option is not directly related to the passage, which does not discuss the effects of a particular circumstance.\n   B. It does not assume that all of the results are instances of the phenomenon that the theory is intended to explain. This option is not relevant to the passage, which does not discuss the assumption of the theory.\n   C. It predicts that seemingly minor variations in research methodology can have a dramatic effect on results. This option is not mentioned in the passage, which does not discuss research methodology.\n   D. Its account is based on a statistical tendency rather than on the supposition that the results arise from a causal connection. This option is not relevant to the passage, which does not discuss the basis of the theory.\n   E. It indicates why a similar outcome may be preceded by very different circumstances on different occasions. This option is consistent with the passage, which suggests that the theory can explain why a plant community becomes more susceptible to invasion under different circumstances (e.g., near-complete exploitation can occur in both species-rich and species-poor communities).\n\n4. Eliminating incorrect options and selecting the best answer: Options A, B, C, and D are not supported by the passage, so the correct answer is E. The theory based on fluctuating resource availability might resolve the \"apparently conflicting and ambiguous results\" because it indicates why a similar outcome (susceptibility to invasion) may be preceded by very different circumstances (e.g., different levels of resource availability) on different occasions.",

We need to identify these factors based on the information provided in the passage.\n\n2. The relevant information in the passage states that several factors lead to greater temperature swings at Earth’s polar regions. These factors include:\n   - The high reflectivity of snow and ice, which when melted exposes soil that absorbs heat.\n   - The thinness of the polar atmosphere, which requires less energy to warm.\n   - The lesser amount of solar energy lost to evaporation at the poles compared to the tropics.\n\n3. Now, let's evaluate each option based on the passage content:\n   - **A. the amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles**: The passage mentions that less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics, which implies that this is a contributing factor to temperature swings. Therefore, this option is correct.\n   - **B. soil exposure due to melting snow**: The passage clearly states that if snow and ice melt, the exposed soil absorbs heat, which accelerates warming. This indicates that this factor contributes to temperature swings. Thus, this option is also correct.\n   - **C. the relatively thin atmosphere at the poles**: The passage mentions that the polar atmosphere is thin, requiring little energy to warm it, which is another factor contributing to temperature swings. Therefore, this option is correct as well.\n\n4. Since all three options are supported by the passage, we do not eliminate any options. \n\nFINAL ANSWER: A, B, C\n\nIn summary, all three options are correct because they each represent factors mentioned in the passage that contribute to temperature swings in the polar regions. The passage provides clear evidence for each factor, making them valid choices.",

The relevant information in the passage states that \"Feminist reclamations of Fern... emphasize her nonsentimental qualities.\" This indicates that \"reclamations\" refers to a process of reclaiming or restoring a different understanding or appreciation of Fern's work, particularly in a feminist context.\n\n3.

The relevant information is in the second paragraph, where the author describes the reaction of progressive theater critics to Belasco's production. The critics \"derided\" Belasco's work, considering him a craftsman who merely captured surface realities.\n\n3. Let's evaluate each option based on the passage content:\n   A. The passage does not suggest that the critics misunderstood Belasco's conception of modernity. Instead, it implies that they disagreed with his approach.\n   B. The passage does not mention Belasco's intention to use elements of the New Stagecraft. In fact, it suggests that Belasco's work was criticized for being the opposite of the New Stagecraft.\n   C. The passage actually suggests the opposite: the critics considered Belasco's work to be literalistic and lacking in expressiveness.\n   D. This option is supported by the passage. The critics' reaction reflects a discrepancy between popular tastes in entertainment (which appreciated the realistic set) and the tastes of progressive theater critics (who preferred a more subjective and minimalist approach).\n   E. The passage does not suggest that the production relied on the appeal of the realistic set to compensate for weaknesses in other aspects of the production. Instead, it implies that the critics considered the set to be the main issue.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, option D is the best answer because it accurately reflects the author's implication about the reaction of progressive theater critics to Belasco's production. The critics' reaction reflects a discrepancy between popular tastes in entertainment and the tastes of progressive theater critics.",

The question asks us to infer which statement the theater critics would be most likely to agree with about theatrical productions.\n\n2. The relevant information in the passage is in the second paragraph, where it describes the New Stagecraft theories of European artists like Max Reinhardt. According to the passage, the New Stagecraft rejected theatrical literalism and drew inspiration from the subjectivity and minimalism of modern painters, advocating for simplified sets designed to express a dramatic text's central ideas.\n\n3.

In fact, it mentions that Belasco's reproduction of a Childs cafeteria impressed the public.\n\nC. This option aligns with the passage's description of the New Stagecraft, which advocates for minimalism and simplified sets to express a dramatic text's central ideas. This suggests that productions employing minimalism may have greater appeal to modern audiences than productions that rely on theatrical literalism.\n\nD.

It suggests that a work could have survived in many copies that were simply unnoticed due to lack of interest, rather than being destroyed. It also discusses the implications of quotations by medieval authors and how they may not necessarily indicate firsthand knowledge of the ancient texts.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option based on the passage content**:\n   - **A. It is possible that fewer manuscripts were destroyed by barbarians in the early Middle Ages than scholars frequently suppose.** This option is not directly supported by the passage. While it mentions that the destruction by barbarians is a common assumption, it does not specifically state that fewer manuscripts were destroyed than supposed.\n   - **B. Additional copies of some so-called lone survivor manuscripts may have existed well into the Middle Ages.** This option aligns with the passage, which states that a work could have survived in numerous copies in monastic libraries but went unnoticed due to lack of interest. This suggests that there may have been additional copies beyond the \"lone survivor.\"\n   - **C. If an ancient Roman text is quoted in a work by a medieval author, then it is likely that at least one manuscript copy of that text survived into the Middle Ages.** This option is misleading. The passage indicates that while medieval authors quoted ancient texts, such quotations do not necessarily imply that a manuscript survived; they could derive from other sources.\n\n4. **Eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer**: \n   - Option A is not supported by the passage.\n   - Option C is misleading as it implies certainty about the survival of manuscripts based on quotations, which the passage does not support.\n   - Option B is directly supported by the passage, which discusses the possibility of additional copies existing unnoticed.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: B\n\n**Reasoning**: Option B is correct because the passage explicitly states that a work could have survived in multiple copies during the Middle Ages, even if only one manuscript is known today. This aligns with the idea that \"lone survivor\" manuscripts may not represent the totality of copies that existed. Options A and C are incorrect because they either misinterpret the passage or make unsupported claims about the survival of manuscripts.",

The relevant information is in the passage, specifically in the paragraph that mentions Astell: \"Astell, like those who echoed her sentiments two and a half centuries later, must be credited for admirable zeal in setting out to right scholarly wrongs, but her supposition that historians were only male is inaccurate.\"\n\n3. Evaluating each option:\n   A. It is likely to have arisen because of Astell’s unawareness of much of the historical work written by women. This option is supported by the passage, which states that \"much historical writing by women of the late seventeenth century was not published until the nineteenth century.\" This suggests that Astell may not have been aware of the historical work written by women, which could have led to her supposition.\n   B. It was one that Astell reconsidered after she wrote her own historical work. The passage does not mention Astell reconsidering her supposition after writing her own historical work.\n   C. It was one that was not shared by other feminist historians of Astell’s time. The passage does not provide information about the views of other feminist historians of Astell's time.\n   D. It was one that inspired Astell to write her own historical work. The passage does not suggest that Astell's supposition inspired her to write her own historical work.\n   E. It directly contradicts one of the basic claims of herstory. The passage does not suggest that Astell's supposition directly contradicts the basic claims of herstory.\n\n4. Eliminating incorrect options and selecting the best answer: Options B, C, D, and E are not supported by the passage, so the best answer is A.",
