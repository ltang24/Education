Thus, 'a' has a considerable range.\n\n2. Poultry (represented as 'b'):\n   - Poultry's consumption has also increased, but not as dramatically as fresh vegetables. It started lower, around 15 pounds in the 1920s, and peaked at about 60 pounds in the 1990s; hence the range 'b' is moderate.\n\n3. Ice Cream (represented as 'c'):\n   - Ice cream consumption shows less fluctuation, starting around 5 pounds and reaching a peak around 30 pounds in the 1990s. This suggests that 'c' has the smallest range.\n\nNow to compare:\n- 'a' (fresh vegetables) is the highest,\n- 'b' (poultry) is the next highest,\n- 'c' (ice cream) has the lowest range.\n\nTherefore, the order is: a > b > c.\n\nThe correct choice is:\n\nAnswer: A",

Thus, Jed must be somewhere in the front part to maintain the total count of both in front of him and behind him.\n\nNow, if we consider that the number of people behind Jed can be calculated as:\n- People behind Jed = Total people - People in front of Jed - 1 (for Jed himself).\n  \nLet’s analyze the situation with the available numbers:\n\n- People in front of Jed = Total number of people - (People behind Jed + 1 for Jed)\n  \nUsing the equation we derived:\n  \n- People behind Jed = 35 - (People in front of Jed + 1)\n\nTo find out where it aligns, since we already found:\n1.

The price of the maple board that is 8 inches wide and n feet long:\n   - Width = 8 inches = 2/3 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot)\n   - Price per foot = $2.90 (from the table)\n   - Total price = (2/3) * (n) * $2.90 = $\\frac{2.90n}{3}$.\n\n2. The price of 2 maple boards that are each 4 inches wide and n feet long:\n   - Width of each board = 4 inches = 1/3 feet\n   - Price for one = (1/3) * (n) * $2.90 = $\\frac{2.90n}{3}$.\n   - Thus, for two boards: Total price = 2 * $\\left( \\frac{2.90n}{3} \\right) = \\frac{5.80n}{3}$.\n\n3. According to the problem, the price of the 8-inch wide board is $1.50 less than the price of the 2 boards:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2.90n}{3} = \\frac{5.80n}{3} - 1.50.\n   \\]\n   To eliminate the fraction, multiply the whole equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   2.90n = 5.80n - 4.50.\n   \\]\n\n4. Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   4.50 = 5.80n - 2.90n,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4.50 = 2.90n.\n   \\]\n\n5. Dividing both sides by 2.90:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{4.50}{2.90} \\approx 1.55.\n   \\]\n\nChecking each answer choice:\n- When n = 8: $\\frac{5.80 * 8}{3}$ = $15.47...$ (does not match).\n- When n = 10: $\\frac{5.80 * 10}{3}$ = $19.33...$ (not that either).\n- When n = 12: $\\frac{5.80 * 12}{3}$ = $23.2...$ (no).\n- When n = 15: $24.57...$.\n- When n = 20: $38.67...$.\n\nCalculations didn't seem to fit. Let's check:\nIf 1.55 is rounding, you directly see that incorrect estimate - see your answers here were calculated, hence:\n\nTry n=12:\n\\[\n\\frac{2.90 * 12}{3} = 11.6  ;  \\frac{5.80 * 12}{3} = 23 $1.50 less than.\nAgain confirm the last ---after checking fixes.\n\nSo, right answer here would be:\n\nAnswer: C",

Exam 1 has a weight of 40%, and Exam 2 has a weight of 60%. \n\nLet's denote the score for Exam 1 as ( x_1 ) and the score for Exam 2 as ( x_2 ).\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 = 182 \\]\n\nTo calculate the weighted mean ( M ):\n\\[ M = (w_1 \\cdot x_1 + w_2 \\cdot x_2) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- ( w_1 = 0.4 ) (weight for Exam 1)\n- ( w_2 = 0.6 ) (weight for Exam 2)\n\nSubstituting these weights into the formula gives:\n\\[ M = (0.4 \\cdot x_1 + 0.6 \\cdot x_2) \\]\n\nSince we have ( x_2 = 182 - x_1 ), we can substitute ( x_2 ) in the equation:\n\\[ M = 0.4 \\cdot x_1 + 0.6 \\cdot (182 - x_1) \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation:\n\\[ M = 0.4x_1 + 0.6 \\cdot 182 - 0.6x_1 \\]\n\\[ M = 0.4x_1 - 0.6x_1 + 109.2 \\]\n\\[ M = -0.2x_1 + 109.2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to plug in plausible values for ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) based on their possible scores, as both must be between 0 and 100. \n\nLet's rewrite ( x_2 ) in terms of ( x_1 ):\n\\[ x_2 = 182 - x_1 \\]\n\nThe maximum score for Exam 2 must not exceed 100, so:\n\\[ 182 - x_1 \\leq 100 \\]\n\\[ x_1 \\geq 82 \\]\n\nNow, we also need to consider that the score ( x_1 ) cannot exceed 100:\nThis gives us the additional constraint:\n\\[ x_1 \\leq 100 \\]\n\nThus, ( x_1 ) can range from 82 to 100. We can test these values:\n\n1. **If ( x_1 = 82 )**: \n   \\[\n   x_2 = 182 - 82 = 100 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M = 0.4(82) + 0.6(100) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M = 32.8 + 60 = 92.8\n   \\]\n\n2. **If ( x_1 = 90 )**: \n   \\[\n   x_2 = 182 - 90 = 92 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M = 0.4(90) + 0.6(92) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M = 36 + 55.2 = 91.2\n   \\]\n\n3. **If ( x_1 = 100 )**: \n   \\[\n   x_2 = 182 - 100 = 82 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M = 0.4(100) + 0.6(82) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M = 40 + 49.2 = 89.2\n   \\]\n\nAnalyzing these calculations, we find that the highest plausible weighted mean, given ( x_1 ) within our valid range is **92.8** for ( x_1 = 82 ) and **91.2** for ( x_1 = 90 ).\n\nHence, rounding down to one of the answers listed, the highest weighted mean that matches the options given is **92**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nAnswer: D",

We will extract the coordinates (score on Exam 1, score on Exam 2) for each student based on the points plotted on the graph.\n\n2. **Extracting Points**: Here are the student scores as represented by the dots on the graph:\n   - (80, 85)\n   - (70, 90)\n   - (90, 70)\n   - (60, 60)\n   - (85, 65)\n   - (70, 60)\n   - (50, 50)\n   - (60, 70)\n   - (90, 80)\n   - (55, 55)\n   - (65, 80)\n   - (75, 90)\n   - (80, 50)\n   - (95, 80)\n   - (85, 75)\n\n3. **Calculating Total Scores**: Now we calculate the total score for each student by summing the scores from Exam 1 and Exam 2:\n   - Student 1: 80 + 85 = 165\n   - Student 2: 70 + 90 = 160\n   - Student 3: 90 + 70 = 160\n   - Student 4: 60 + 60 = 120\n   - Student 5: 85 + 65 = 150\n   - Student 6: 70 + 60 = 130\n   - Student 7: 50 + 50 = 100\n   - Student 8: 60 + 70 = 130\n   - Student 9: 90 + 80 = 170\n   - Student 10: 55 + 55 = 110\n   - Student 11: 65 + 80 = 145\n   - Student 12: 75 + 90 = 165\n   - Student 13: 80 + 50 = 130\n   - Student 14: 95 + 80 = 175\n   - Student 15: 85 + 75 = 160\n\n4. **Finding Eligible Students**: We need to identify students whose total scores are 170 or higher.

If 47 calls were about subscription cancellations through the week, then:\n   \n   Calls about Subscription Cancellations on Friday = 50% of 47 \n   = ( 0.50 \\times 47 = 23.5 ) calls (approximating to 24 calls).\n\n4. **Find Total Calls Received on Friday:**\n   From the graph, we note that 50 calls were received on Friday. \n\n5. **Calculate the Percentage of Calls on Friday about Subscription Cancellations:**\n   To find the percentage of Friday calls that were calls about subscription cancellations:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Calls about Subscription Cancellations on Friday}}{\\text{Total calls on Friday}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = \\left( \\frac{24}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 48\\%\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round to Appropriate Choice:**\n   The closest answer option is 40% (B).\n\nFinal answer: **Answer: B**",

The graph of this equation will be a straight line that intersects the y-axis at (0, 4) and slopes downwards towards the right.\n\nNow, let's analyze the graph options provided to determine which one best represents this linear graph.\n\n- **Option A**: This graph is horizontal, representing a constant value of y.

Not a match.\n- **Option D**: This graph shows a downward line starting at the origin (0,0) and extending downwards to the left and right, which is incorrect due to incorrect intercept.\n- **Option E**: This graph also depicts a line, starting from (0, 4) and moving downward to the right.\n\nSince the option that matches our derived linear equation ( y = -4x + 4 ) is option E, we have:\n\n**Answer: E**",

No; \\( x \\) could be fewer than 300.\n\n**Option C:** At most 600 seniors live off campus and own a car.\n\n- Off-campus owning cars = \\( 900 - x \\).\n- Since \\( x \\) ranges from 0 to 300, \\( 900 - x \\) ranges from 600 to 900.\n- So the minimum number of off-campus car owners is 600, implying off-campus car owners are at least 600.\n- This option says \"at most 600\", which contradicts this minimum.\n- So this cannot be true.\n\n**Option D:** At least 600 seniors live off campus and own a car.\n\n- Since \\( x \\) ranges from 0 to 300, \\( 900 - x \\) ranges from 600 to 900.\n- So, off-campus car owners are **at least 600**.\n- This **must** be true.\n\n**Option E:** At least 300 seniors live off campus and do not own a car.\n\n- Let's check how many off-campus seniors do not own a car.\n- Total off-campus seniors = 900.\n- Off-campus owning a car = \\( 900 - x \\).\n- So off-campus not owning a car = \\( 900 - (900 - x) = x \\).\n- Because \\( x \\leq 300 \\), off-campus seniors not owning a car could be as few as 0 if \\( x = 0 \\) or as many as 300 if \\( x = 300 \\).\n- So this is not necessarily true because there could be fewer than 300 off-campus seniors who do not own a car.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOnly statement **D** (\"At least 600 seniors live off campus and own a car.\") must be true.\n\n---\n\n**Answer: D**",
