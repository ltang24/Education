      "question, the answers, and any specific information from the passage carefully.\n",
      "Now, let’s look at these POE tools in detail.\n",
      "Extreme Language\n",
      "Typically, extreme language in an answer choice will make that answer choice\n",
      "wrong. Take a look at the following sentence:\n",
      "Everyone loves chocolate ice cream.\n",
      "ETS would never have this sentence as part of the correct answer. Why?\n",
      "Because it’s too easy to prove wrong. All you have to say is, “I hate chocolate\n",
      "ice cream.”\n",
      "The following provides a list of words that are usually extreme language in the\n",
      "land of ETS.\n",
      "everyone\n",
      "no one\n",
      "only\n",
      "never\n",
      "never\n",
      "always\n",
      "must\n",
      "impossible\n",
      "Keep in mind that, at first glance, some words may not look as if they are\n",
      "extreme. For example, the word is. Consider the following sentence:\n",
      "It is the answer.\n",
      "Does ETS know for sure that it is? How can ETS prove it without a doubt? Or\n",
      "think about the word will:\n",
      "The United States will buy more imports in the next ten years.\n",
      "Is ETS capable of predicting the future? This isn’t to say that, if an answer\n",
      "choice contains is or will, it’s wrong. Just remember that, in certain contexts,\n",
      "words can take on extreme meanings. Here’s a list of words that ETS uses on the\n",
      "Reading Comprehension section that can often be extreme:\n",
      "resolve\n",
      "reconcile\n",
      "prove\n",
      "define\n",
      "trace\n",
      "Well, if extreme language is bad, then guess what? Wishy-washy wording is\n",
      "good— words like can, may, most, some, sometimes, possible, seldom, few.\n",
      "So, the general rule of thumb: Answer choices that contain extreme language are\n",
      "usually wrong. Answer choices that contain wishy-washy wording or are\n",
      "moderate in tone are usually right. Before you eliminate extreme language, look\n",
      "back at the passage to see if the extreme language is supported, because\n",
      "sometimes an author does say something extreme.\n",
      "No Such Comparison\n",
      "This type of wrong answer is easy to spot. ETS will often invent a comparison\n",
      "that didn’t exist in the passage. Common words include any phrases used for\n",
      "comparisons: more than, less than, similar to, better, worse, etc. While it’s\n",
      "possible that a legitimate comparison could be made in the passage, the chances\n",
      "are slim. ETS prefers to use comparisons to make wrong answers. Furthermore,\n",
      "judgmental words such as better and worse could lead to lawsuits by test takers\n",
      "who disagree with those assessments.\n",
      "Reversals\n",
      "This seems like an easy error to spot. Just find the answer that says the opposite\n",
      "of what you’re looking for, right? It’s not that easy, particularly if you’re reading\n",
      "too fast. Consider this example:\n",
      "B) to provide support for the contention that all cobalt mines in sub-\n",
      "Saharan Africa have experienced a certain degree of looting\n",
      "B) to provide support for the contention that not all cobalt mines in sub-\n",
      "Saharan Africa have experienced a certain degree of looting\n",
      "One word changed, and the answer becomes one hundred and eighty degrees\n",
      "different. It’s very easy to miss. Similarly, ETS could change one or two words,\n",
      "as follows:\n",
      "B) to provide support for the contention that all cobalt mines in sub-\n",
      "Saharan Africa have experienced a certain degree of looting\n",
      "B) to provide criticism of the contention that all cobalt mines in sub-\n",
      "Saharan Africa have experienced a certain degree of looting\n",
      "Lastly ETS might reverse the order of the words in such a way that utterly\n",
      "changes the meaning of the sentence. Read this one carefully:\n",
      "In the late 15th century, Christopher Columbus sailed from the New\n",
      "World to Europe in search of spices.\n",
      "Again, speed is the enemy. Your eye may glance over the sentence, see New\n",
      "World, Europe, and Christopher Columbus, then think, “Yep! Looks good!”\n",
      "Failing to notice, of course, that this sentence says the Genoese sailor actually\n",
      "traveled from the New World to Europe, not the other way around.\n",
      "Recycled Language and Memory Traps\n",
      "With rare exception, all of us believe that our memories are perfect. Yet the fact\n",
      "is that most people don’t have perfect recall, and that we misinterpret regularly.\n",
      "Without outside interference, we carry those misinterpreted thoughts for\n",
      "minutes, hours, days, or until we eventually forget them.\n",
      "ETS knows this about us, and so very cunningly lays memory traps designed to\n",
      "appeal to the part of our brains that pokes us in the rib cage and says, “Don’t you\n",
      "remember reading that? You just read that!” The problem is that the answer\n",
      "choice will be describing the wrong portion of the passage.\n",
      "Recycled language traps also literally recycle language. Therefore, if you\n",
      "remember seeing the phrase pygmy internment camp in the passage, and an\n",
      "answer choice uses the words pygmy internment camp, eliminate that choice. If\n",
      "ETS wants to refer to a pygmy internment camp in the correct answer, it will\n",
      "find a synonym for that phrase. Or it will refer to the category in which it is\n",
      "included, such as wartime detention.\n",
      "Outside Knowledge\n",
      "Less common than the other errors, an outside knowledge trap is going to be\n",
      "chosen by the most intellectually sure among us. In other words, just because\n",
      "something is true outside the exam doesn’t make it the correct answer. The\n",
      "question may be asking something different, or the context of the knowledge\n",
      "may have changed. Regardless, try to forget everything you know when you read\n",
      "the passages. The text is everything, the alpha and the omega, the beginning and\n",
      "the end.\n",
      "Emotional Appeals\n",
      "Equally less common are answer choices that attempt to appeal to the general\n",
      "emotions in people, usually based on hot topics, but which are not discussed in\n",
      "the passage. An example might look like this:\n",
      "C) The continued injustice of discrimination in the housing market\n",
      "This choice may appeal to certain test takers who believe this is true. And, its\n",
      "entirely possible that it is true. But, it’s also entirely possible that that answer\n",
      "choice isn’t the most specific or most accurate response to the question. In these\n",
      "cases, do your best to put aside any biases you may have and stay focused on the\n",
      "task at hand, which is determining whether or not the passage supports the\n",
      "answer choice.\n",
      "GENERAL QUESTIONS\n",
      "Okay—let’s go back and talk about the question types. Let’s start off with\n",
      "general questions. These are questions that ask you to provide “big picture”\n",
      "information about the passage. Below are some examples of how general\n",

      "To answer any general question, focus on the main idea. Typically, an answer to\n",
      "a general question contains some sort of paraphrased version of the main idea.\n",

      "Special Note on Tone Questions\n",
      "Tone questions are a gift. Occasionally, they can be specific questions—that is,\n",
      "they ask about how the author feels about a particular paragraph rather than how\n",
      "he or she feels about the entire passage. But the approach to tone questions,\n",
      "whether general or specific, is basically the same. Take a look at the following\n",

      "(C). Why? Think of extremes. ETS doesn’t like extremes, right? Therefore, the\n",
      "right answer to a tone question is never going to be extremely positive or\n",
      "extremely negative. It’s going to be somewhere in between. An author can be\n",
      "neutral or objective. He or she can be appreciative or slightly critical. But the\n",
      "author is never going to love something to death or hate something completely.\n",
      "Again, extreme is bad; moderation is good.\n",
      "(Note that apathetic or indifferent are always wrong answers on tone questions.\n",

      "These answer choices are extremely neutral.)\n",

      "No ifs, ands, or buts. You must do this. Never, never, never rely on your\n",
      "memory. Your memory is your worst enemy. That being said, let’s talk about the\n",
      "two major groups of specific questions: line reference and lead word.\n",
      "Line Reference\n",
      "Line reference questions are easy to identify because they always contain a line\n",
      "reference or a highlighted portion of the passage. Consider these examples:\n",
      "The author mentions T. H. White (line 40) in order\n",
      "to…\n",

      "to the situation described by the author as…(lines\n",
      "15–19)?\n",
      "15–19)?\n",
      "You get the idea. Line reference questions are great because they tell you where\n",
      "you should go in the passage to find the information. But they’re also a little\n",
      "tricky because the information you’re looking for typically isn’t contained\n",
      "exactly in the line reference. Rather, it’s usually a little bit before the line\n",
      "reference or a little bit after. Therefore, here’s your approach to any line\n",
      "reference question:\n",
      "1. Use the line reference to guide you to the right area of the passage.\n",
      "2. Read roughly five lines above the line reference and roughly five lines\n",
      "below.\n",
      "3. Answer the question, based on what you’ve read, in your own words (i.e.,\n",
      "paraphrase) before moving on to the answer choices.\n",
      "Proven Techniques\n",
      "Lead Word\n",
      "Lead word questions are basically line reference questions without the line\n",
      "reference. Well, if you don’t have the line reference, how do you know where in\n",
      "the passage to look for the information? The answer is the lead word.\n",
      "The lead word is a word or phrase that’s easy to skim for. Usually, the lead word\n",
      "stands out in the question because it’s the most important or the most specific.\n",
      "What’s the lead word in the following question?\n",
      "It can be inferred that, during the 1840s, the\n",
      "abolitionist movement did which of the following?\n",
      "The lead word is 1840s. Abolitionist movement could be a lead word(s), but only\n",
      "if the entire passage were not about the abolitionist movement. If the main idea\n",
      "were the abolitionist movement, would abolitionist movement be easy to skim\n",
      "for? Nope. 1840s is a good lead word because it’s specific and it’s very easy to\n",
      "skim for. Numbers, words that have capital letters at the beginning, and\n",
      "italicized words are all good lead words because they’re easy to skim for.\n",
      "Once you’ve identified the lead word in a question, here’s your approach:\n",
      "1. Skim (don’t read) the passage for the lead word.\n",
      "2. Once you find the line that contains the lead word, read roughly five lines\n",
      "before and five lines after.\n",
      "3. Based on what you’ve read, answer the question in your own words (i.e.,\n",
      "paraphrase). Do this before moving on to the answer choices.\n",
      "Keep in mind that the lead word may appear more than once in the passage. So if\n",
      "you read the lines surrounding the lead word and don’t find the answer to the\n",
      "question, skim the rest of the passage for another appearance of the lead word.\n",
      "Also keep in mind that the lead word in the question won’t necessarily be\n",
      "perfectly represented in the passage. For example, if the lead word in the\n",
      "question is “governmental intrusion,” you may find the passage talking about\n",

      "Scoring\n",
      "Each essay will receive two scores, ranging from 0 to 6. If the scores are within\n",
      "one point of each other, they will be averaged. If the scores are not within one\n",
      "point of each other (this is rare), then an expert reader will be brought in to read\n",
      "and score the essay. The final scores for the two essays are then averaged and\n",
      "rounded to the nearest half point.\n",
      "For example, your Argument essay may receive a 5 from both readers, so your\n",

      "based on their overall impression of the essay. There’s no checklist that they use\n",
      "to sum up the points (e.g., half a point for good grammar, one point for a good\n",
      "conclusion, etc.). It’s okay to make minor grammatical or spelling errors as long\n",

      "didn’t seem to connect to your position, or maybe you just wrote about\n",
      "something only tangentially related to the question asked.\n",

      "and write a strong Argument essay later in this chapter.\n",
      "Proven Techniques\n",
      "Essay Writing Basics\n",
      "It’s important to understand that the essays you write for the GRE are not going\n",
      "to be masterpieces. We’re not redefining the craft of writing here. You have\n",
      "limited time to write and revise, so what we’re talking about is a quickly\n",
      "produced first-draft essay.\n",
      "In order to score well, there are several components your essay should have. The\n",
      "following are some of the most important:\n",
      "• Length. This is a good example of the difference between GRE writing and\n",
      "real writing. In the real world, good, vigorous writing is concise. Unnecessary\n",
      "things are cut out. On the GRE, you want to write as much as you can. That\n",
      "doesn’t mean that you’re filling the screen with blather or repeating yourself\n",
      "a hundred times, but you do want to expand on your ideas as much as\n",
      "possible and explore as many of their ramifications as you can. Be thorough.\n",
      "However, in your quest for length, know that depth is better than breadth. It’s\n",
      "much better to have a few well-chosen examples that you explore in depth\n",
      "than many examples that you discuss only superficially. The bottom line is\n",
      "that high-scoring essays are usually long, and low-scoring essays are usually\n",
      "short. Make it as long as time permits. Aiming for about 500 words is a good\n",
      "guideline.\n",
      "• Organization. Remember, the readers are going to go through your essay\n",
      "very quickly, and they’re grading holistically. You need to make a good\n",
      "overall impression. No brilliant example, no amazing turn of phrase will save\n",
      "your essay if it is disorganized. One of the primary things the readers are\n",
      "looking for is a well-structured, well-organized piece of writing. In a sense\n",
      "the structure is much more important than the content. No one really cares\n",
      "what you say—they’re not reading your essay to decide whether they agree\n",
      "with you. They care how you say it—whether you write a well-planned,\n",
      "logical response to the prompt. The easiest way to organize your essay is to\n",
      "use the old boring four-or five-paragraph essay format that you first learned\n",
      "in sixth grade: introduction, two or three body paragraphs, and a conclusion.\n",
      "Hard to believe something so basic could work on the GRE? Believe it.\n",
      "We’re not writing real essays here, we’re learning how to tackle a\n",
      "standardized test.\n",
      "• Introduction and Conclusion. This is really part of organization, but it’s\n",
      "important enough to discuss separately. Your essay must have an introduction\n",
      "and a conclusion. You can’t simply launch into an example in the first\n",
      "sentence of your essay—the reader will be jolted. You have to ease the reader\n",
      "into the essay by spreading out a road map of where the essay is going. A\n",
      "good introduction can do a lot for you, because a reader who comes away\n",
      "with a good impression from the introduction is more likely to keep that good\n",
      "impression throughout the rest of your essay. Think of it as building\n",
      "goodwill. A conclusion is also crucial, because you don’t want your essay to\n",
      "just en—. Wow. See how jarring that was? Now you probably wouldn’t end\n",
      "in mid-word, but the point is that you have to bring your reader home with\n",
      "some kind of summation. The essay needs closure. A strong introduction\n",
      "gives the reader a good first impression; a strong conclusion leaves the reader\n",
      "with a good last impression.\n",
      "• Clear Point of View. Unlike the other points mentioned so far, this one is not\n",
      "structural but rather content-based. It should always be clear to someone\n",
      "reading your essay exactly where you stand. Whether you’re presenting your\n",
      "opinion in the Issue essay or critiquing the argument in the Argument essay,\n",
      "your own position should always be clear. When a clear point of view isn’t\n",
      "present, your essay is weak and abstract, and the reader doesn’t know why\n",
      "you wrote it—you clearly had nothing to say. When this situation arises, most\n",
      "of the time it’s because you haven’t actually figured out what you think.\n",
      "You’re hoping to uncover it by writing about it, but that rarely works. Instead\n",
      "you end up with an essay that reads as though you were trying to discover\n",
      "your point of view along the way—which is exactly what you are doing. In\n",
      "order to write a high-scoring essay, you need to know what it is you want to\n",
      "say. And that means that you have to think before you write. Writing is just\n",
      "thinking on paper, but the thinking has to come first. We’ll discuss this in\n",
      "more detail shortly.\n",
      "• Proper Grammar and Effective Language. To some degree, of course,\n",
      "your essay score will be affected by how well you write. If your sentences are\n",
      "all the same length and same structure, your writing will be monotonous. If\n",
      "you make numerous or prominent grammatical errors, it will seem careless\n",
      "and unsophisticated. Using language well is part of good essay writing. We\n",
      "can’t really teach you in this book to be a better writer (that’s an entire book\n",
      "in itself), but we’ll try to give you some helpful guidance along the way. In\n",
      "general, try to write as well as you can, but don’t think that you need\n",
      "complicated syntax or fancy rhetorical flourishes to be successful on the\n",
      "Analytical Writing section. Use language that you’re comfortable with and\n",
      "you should be fine. This is the GRE. You don’t need the essay-writing skills\n",

      "THE FOUR RULES\n",
      "There are four basic rules we’re going to follow while writing an essay. Poorly\n",
      "written essays tend to be essays that don’t have a clear purpose. Although the\n",
      "Issue and Argument essays each have their own peculiarities we’ll have to take\n",
      "into account, remembering the following four rules will keep your essay,\n",
      "whichever one it is, focused.\n",
      "1. Spend time thinking.\n",
      "2. Make a plan and stick to it.\n",
      "3. Include only one thought per paragraph.\n",
      "4. Clearly link each paragraph to your thesis.\n",
      "Spend Time Thinking\n",
      "Time is ticking. We know. It’s scary. There’s even a little clock, right there in\n",
      "the corner of the screen, counting down tick by tick. Take a deep breath. Even\n",
      "though time is limited, don’t rush into writing before you’re ready. If you do,\n",
      "you’ll find that you quickly run out of things to say, and you’ll have a screen full\n",
      "of random, unconnected sentences in front of you. It’s better to spend some time\n",
      "up front thinking about what you’ll say.\n",
      "So relax a bit. Read the prompt. You’ve got scratch paper, so use it. What’s your\n",
      "initial thought after you read the prompt? Write it down. Write down all your\n",
      "thoughts, even the stupid ones. The idea is just to get your thoughts down\n",
      "without any inhibitions. (No one will take away points from your essay because\n",
      "you wrote something stupid down on your scratch paper.) Play devil’s advocate.\n",
      "Think about the other side of the issue or argument. What examples can you\n",
      "use?\n",
      "You will probably spend around 5 minutes without typing a single word. If so,\n",
      "good. Trust us, it will pay off later.\n",
      "Make a Plan and Stick to It\n",
      "Now you’ve got some ideas. Perfect. Lay them out into the rough outlines of an\n",
      "essay. What’s your introduction? If it’s the Issue essay, you’ll need to state your\n",
      "opinion, also known as your thesis, clearly. If it’s the Argument, it will probably\n",
      "be some variation of “This argument is potentially flawed, and we will need\n",
      "more information to determine whether or not to use it.”\n",
      "How will you support your thesis? What examples will you use, or what flaws\n",
      "will you point out? As soon as you know, you know exactly what your\n",
      "paragraphs will be. Write down that outline on your scratch paper.\n",
      "That is your roadmap for the essay. Do not deviate from it. It’s a good plan.\n",
      "Many people have the impulse to change their entire essay at the last second.\n",
      "Don’t. Stick with your plan. Whenever you get lost in your essay, look back to\n",
      "your scratch paper to see what you should be writing about.\n",
      "Applied Strategies\n",
      "Include Only One Thought Per Paragraph\n",
      "The people who grade your essay are not going to take printouts of your essay to\n",
      "a luxurious reading room, sit upon large padded velvet chairs, pour themselves\n",
      "glasses of brandy, light their pipes, and settle in to examine your thoughts. They\n",
      "will read your essay from a computer monitor as quickly as possible while\n",
      "sitting in an office chair with poor back support. They’re not going to give you\n",
      "the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "Therefore, you need to make each point incredibly easy for them to find. Each\n",
      "paragraph will contain one, and only one, point, and support for that point.\n",
      "Nothing else.\n",
      "You already know, from your plan, what each paragraph will be about. If you\n",
      "start wandering from that plan, and from the point of the paragraph, you’re going\n",
      "to lose the reader. The teddy bear was invented in two places independently of\n",
      "each other: 1902 in the United States, and in 1903 in Germany. If you’re\n",
      "confused, you’re not alone. Switching from one point to another in the middle of\n",
      "the paragraph makes for jarring, incomprehensible writing.\n",
      "Clearly Link Each Paragraph to Your Thesis\n",
      "Once you have your thesis, every single thing you write in your essay should\n",
      "exist for one purpose, and one purpose only: to prove your thesis. If you are not\n",
      "actively supporting your thesis, then you’re not answering the question.\n",
      "It may not be as obvious to the graders how your paragraphs link to your thesis\n",
      "as it is to you. So once again, make life easy for those poor, harried GRE essay\n",
      "graders. Let them know exactly how that paragraph connects to the thesis, and\n",
      "how it answers the question they asked.\n",
      "In other words, don’t assume that if you show them Points A and C, that they\n",
      "will know that point B connects the two. Explicitly write that Point A leads to\n",
      "Point B, and Point B leads to Point C, and Point C leads back to your thesis.\n",
      "THE ISSUE ESSAY\n",
      "The first essay that we’re going to look at is the Issue essay. We’ve already\n",
      "discussed the basic tasks for an essay. Now we’re going to look at how you do it.\n",
      "The Prompt\n",
      "The first thing the GRE will give you is a prompt, a short sentence displayed\n",
      "inside a box. They want to know your opinion about that prompt. The prompt\n",
      "will be what they call a “topic of general interest,” which means that ETS thinks\n",
      "almost everyone will have an opinion about it.\n",
      "Here’s a sample Issue Prompt:\n",
      "The best indicator of a glorious nation is the emphasis it\n",
      "places on educating its populace.\n",
      "One thing you may have noticed about this prompt is that it not only presents an\n",
      "issue, but it takes a side. The GRE will never simply say “Education: Discuss.”\n",
      "Instead they’ll take a definite position. It is up to you to agree or disagree with\n",
      "that position, and explain exactly why you agree or disagree.\n",
      "ETS doesn’t actually care about your opinion on the Issue Essay. What they are\n",
      "actually looking for is that you have a clear opinion, and that you back that\n",
      "opinion up. It’s not better to agree than it is to disagree, or vice versa. They don’t\n",
      "care. They simply want to see how you support your position.\n",
      "Directly following the prompt will be an assignment. Although these take a\n",
      "couple different forms, they are always some variation of the following\n",
      "statement:\n",
      "Write a response in which you agree or disagree with the\n",
      "above statement and explain your reasoning for the position\n",
      "you take.\n",
      "Most of the prompts will be similar to the one above: a claim about some sort of\n",
      "topic of importance to society as a whole (laws, education, ideals, technology,\n",
      "etc.) which you can agree or disagree with. There are sometimes slight variations\n",
      "such as these:\n",
      "• Given a claim and a reason for that claim, discuss how much you agree or\n",
      "disagree about the claim and the reason given.\n",
      "• Given two opposing views, discuss the view that you agree with more and\n",
      "explain your reasons. Address both the side you agree with and the opposing\n",
      "side.\n",
      "Even these, however, are hardly different from the typical prompt and\n",
      "assignment. ETS still wants you to clearly state your opinion and the reasons you\n",
      "hold it. (For a full list of Issue topics that the GRE will use, go to\n",
      "www.ets.org/gre).\n",
      "Examples\n",
      "Once you’ve read the prompt and the assignment, write down “Yes” and “No”\n",
      "on your scratch paper. Now it’s time to brainstorm. Think of examples to\n",
      "support each side of the prompt. Don’t worry about which side of the prompt\n",
      "you actually agree with for now. Just focus on the support you could use to argue\n",
      "either side.\n",
      "For our prompt above, for Yes we could list any glorious nation that emphasized\n",
      "education, or any decidedly non-glorious civilizations that did not emphasize\n",
      "education. Note that we can argue the claim by saying “Doing what we say is\n",
      "good, so do what we say,” and we can also argue it by saying “Not doing what\n",
      "we say is bad, so do what we say.” The examples could be from history, current\n",
      "events, literature, film, or your personal experiences. Write down anything you\n",
      "can think of to support your position under Yes on your scratch paper.\n",
      "For No, we could list any glorious nation that did not emphasize educating its\n",
      "citizens, or we could list some non-glorious civilizations that did emphasize\n",
      "education. List anything you can think of to show that education ain’t so needed\n",
      "under No on your scratch paper.\n",
      "Now look at your lists of examples. Was there one side, Yes or No, that had\n",
      "more examples? Are there any particular examples you came up with that you\n",
      "think you could write about particularly well? If so, you’ve found out what you\n",
      "think about the claim. If you’ve got better examples under Yes, then you are\n",
      "100% for education, because it is the most important thing to make a society\n",
      "great. If you’ve got better examples under No, then you are now wholeheartedly\n",
      "devoted to nations focusing on something other than education, because it’s not\n",
      "as necessary as those eggheads think it is.\n",
      "After you’ve chosen a side, put a star next to your strongest 2 or 3 examples.\n",
      "To review: Come up with your examples before you come up with an opinion.\n",
      "Go with whichever opinion has the better examples. Again, the GRE doesn’t\n",
      "care about your opinion; it cares about your support. So focus on support first.\n",
      "Thesis\n",
      "Now that you know your position, it’s time to tell the world. A basic thesis can\n",
      "be something along the lines of\n",
      "Education is the best indicator of a glorious nation.\n",
      "Or\n",
      "Education is not the best indicator of a glorious nation.\n",
      "These are fine theses. They state directly what we think with a minimum of fuss.\n",
      "Although they don’t use the words “Yes” or “No,” it’s still clear what we think.\n",
      "You can always use this sort of clear, simple thesis. However, let’s see if we can\n",
      "do a bit better. Rather than simply restate the claim, we can look at our examples\n",
      "a bit and ask ourselves “How do those examples support my point?” Use that to\n",
      "write your thesis. For instance,\n",
      "Without education, a great nation will not last beyond the current\n",
      "generation.\n",
      "Or\n",
      "Education is no substitute for food, jobs, or military might, all of\n",
      "which are the true indicators of a major nation.\n",
      "Remember that every paragraph you write must link back to your thesis, so feel\n",
      "free to rewrite it a couple times. No matter what, however, make sure it is\n",
      "obvious how your thesis answers the question asked. The most eloquent,\n",
      "profound thesis doesn’t do you any good if it doesn’t have anything to do with\n",
      "the prompt or the assignment.\n",
      "Outline\n",
      "Remember those examples you put stars next to? Each one of those will be a\n",
      "paragraph. Figure out which example will go first, and which next. Keep in mind\n",
      "that you will need to transition from one paragraph to the next, so if you know\n",
      "that mentioning one example will allow you to segue naturally to the next, put\n",
      "them in an order to allow you to use that transition.\n",
      "Now you’ve got your outline:\n",

      "• Conclusion\n",
      "You won’t always stick simply to the above outline, but if you’re ever stuck, it’s\n",
      "a nice simple format to follow. You may use only 1 example, or 3 examples, but\n",
      "no matter how you lay out your essay, figure out a plan beforehand and stick to\n",
      "it.\n",
      "You can also (and sometimes will be required to) use one of the examples from\n",
      "the other side of the argument, and show why it doesn’t actually invalidate your\n",
      "side of the argument. “Sure, some may point to the Athenian city-state as\n",
      "evidence that education is important, but their education was in fact limited\n",
      "almost entirely to a select few. It was Athen’s navy that had far more to do…”\n",
      "Write\n",
      "Here is where all that planning pays off. Using your outline, start writing your\n",
      "essay. Anytime you’re stuck, look back to your outline and ask yourself “What\n",
      "do I need to say right now to support my thesis?”\n",
      "Although you may decide to sparge your essay with a miscellany of abstruse\n",
      "words in order to give your essay a veneer of erudition, don’t. Using advanced\n",
      "vocabulary is fine, but never let it hinder the reader. If you’re not sure if you’re\n",
      "using a word correctly, just using a vocabulary word to use it, or if you think that\n",
      "using a word may obscure your point rather than clarify it, then use a simpler\n",
      "word or phrase instead.\n",
      "Whenever you’re stuck, say things as directly as possible. If you have time, you\n",
      "can always go back later and modify your sentences if necessary, but it’s better\n",
      "to end up with simple, direct sentences at the end than it is to have a couple great\n",
      "sentences that end abruptly because you ran out of time.\n",
      "Time is incredibly important in this essay. Keep watching the clock. You should\n",
      "spend 5–7 minutes on each paragraph. When you have 10 minutes left, move on\n",
      "to the conclusion as soon as possible.\n",
      "Sample Essay\n",
      "In order to accomplish anything great, one must seek unpopularity.\n",
      "Write a response in which you agree or disagree with the above statement and\n",
      "explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing your position,\n",
      "consider situations in which the statement may or may not hold true and\n",
      "explain how these situations shape your decision.\n",
      "Many people who have achieved important objectives have done\n",
      "so at the cost of being unpopular. It is sometimes argued that\n",
      "unpopularity is necessary in order to accomplish anything great\n",
      "and that nothing important is achieved by those who worry about\n",
      "being liked. While this may be true in some situations, many great\n",
      "things have been achieved by people who needed to court\n",
      "popularity in order to do them. In other cases, great things have\n",
      "been achieved by people for whom popularity or unpopularity were\n",
      "irrelevant. The key factor is the particular nature of the\n",
      "objective.\n",
      "When the goal is to accomplish a change in society, unpopularity\n",
      "is probably inevitable. Most people resist large changes, and\n",
      "therefore the people who are pushing for the changes are bound\n",
      "to be unpopular with the section of the population that wants to\n",
      "keep things the way they are. For example, when civil rights\n",
      "leaders such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. were pushing\n",
      "for equal civil rights for black Americans, they were despised by\n",
      "much of the country. The goals they were advancing were\n",
      "controversial and confrontational and this made them deeply\n",
      "unpopular with millions of Americans. Despite this, the cause of civil\n",
      "rights was undoubtedly a great and noble one.\n",
      "In other situations, however, great things can be accomplished\n",
      "and sometimes can only be accomplished by people with popular\n",
      "support. For example, when Britain was in danger of being\n",
      "defeated by Germany in 1940, Franklin Roosevelt was able to use\n",
      "his popularity and political skill to gather support for programs such\n",
      "as the Lend-Lease Act, which gave badly needed supplies to the\n",
      "British military. Without Roosevelt’s skill in rallying the American\n",
      "people, the necessary support might not have been there to defeat\n",
      "the Axis powers and win the war. Victory in World War II is an\n",
      "example of a great thing that could only have been accomplished\n",
      "example of a great thing that could only have been accomplished\n",
      "by a popular leader.\n",
      "Finally, in some circumstances popularity is irrelevant to the\n",
      "achievement of an important task. Some examples of this would be\n",
      "in the realm of scientific and medical research. When Jonas Salk\n",
      "developed the polio vaccine, a dangerous disease was\n",
      "eradicated, which is a great thing. Salk’s accomplishment,\n",
      "however, did not depend on whether he was popular. Similarly,\n",
      "when Einstein wrote his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, his\n",
      "achievement in recognizing that the speed of light is constant for\n",
      "all observers did not depend on whether other scientists liked him.\n",
      "A scientific advance is not judged by the popularity of the\n",
      "scientist who discovers it. It just doesn’t really matter either way.\n",
      "In the end, to know whether unpopularity will be a necessary\n",
      "component of achieving something great, you need to know the\n",
      "type of achievement under discussion. Achievements that require\n",
      "large-scale social change will probably make those who fight for\n",
      "them unpopular, but other types of achievements will only be\n",
      "possible when their supporters are popular. And with still other types\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The introduction accomplishes a few things, all of which you want to do in your\n",
      "essays. First, it establishes what the issue under discussion is. It does this by\n",
      "paraphrasing the prompt in the second sentence. Paraphrasing is usually better\n",
      "than quoting it verbatim, because it’s less boring to the reader, and even seems\n",
      "less lazy. (If the prompt is very short, you may have a hard time paraphrasing it;\n",
      "if this is so, don’t worry about it.) There are other ways to make it clear to the\n",
      "reader what issue is under discussion, but paraphrasing is the simplest.\n",
      "Second, the introduction clearly establishes the point of view of the essay. After\n",
      "reading this introduction, you know quite clearly that the writer believes the\n",
      "prompt is sometimes true, but not always. And it leads you to believe that the\n",
      "following paragraphs will back up those assertions by providing examples of the\n",
      "different types of situations.\n",
      "Body Paragraphs\n",
      "The body paragraphs follow the implicit promise of the introduction to back up\n",
      "the writer’s position. The first paragraph not only explains why the prompt is\n",
      "sometimes true, but presents concrete examples in Malcolm X and Martin Luther\n",
      "King, Jr., to support the point. You always want to make sure that your body\n",
      "paragraphs have concrete details. Abstractions are not persuasive. Specifics and\n",
      "particulars are needed to back up your thesis.\n",
      "The third paragraph logically follows by discussing an example of the opposite\n",

      "support the basic point of view of the essay.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The most important thing about the conclusion is that it’s there. You’ll notice\n",
      "that it doesn’t really say anything that wasn’t already said in the introduction.\n",
      "The purpose of the conclusion is to tie a bow on the essay and give it the feeling\n",
      "of closure. It’s a matter of ending the essay on the right note, with the right tone.\n",

      "THE ARGUMENT ESSAY\n",

      "What Is an Argument?\n",
      "On the GRE, an argument isn’t about you and your roommate yelling at each\n",
      "other over whose turn it is to buy toilet paper. An argument is a short paragraph\n",
      "that attempts to convince you of something by providing evidence. Your job on\n",
      "the GRE is to analyze that argument and discuss how well-reasoned it is—\n",
      "whether it’s logical and persuasive.\n",
      "The Real Task of the Argument Essay\n",
      "The directions on the GRE describe your task as “analyzing” the argument.\n",
      "There’s a simpler way to understand what you’re really supposed to do,\n",
      "however. Your job is to criticize the argument. “Analyzing” sounds like an even-\n",

      "poorly. This argument is terrible.”\n",
      "If the argument were a well-reasoned piece of writing, there wouldn’t be much\n",
      "to say about it. “Great argument! Airtight logic! The reasoning is ironclad! The\n",
      "conclusion must certainly be true!” That wouldn’t make for much of an essay.\n",
      "So the first thing you need to do is reorient yourself to understand the real\n",
      "situation: ETS provides you with a weak, badly reasoned argument, and your job\n",
      "is to rip it apart and demonstrate why it’s so bad. We’ll be showing you how to\n",
      "do exactly that in the following pages.\n",
      "The Parts of an Argument\n",
      "Arguments consist of three basic parts:\n",
      "• Conclusion\n",
      "• Premises\n",
      "• Assumptions\n",
      "Let’s look at each of these components in detail.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The conclusion is the most basic part of an argument. There’s no point in writing\n",
      "an argument unless there’s some conclusion you’re trying to reach. The\n",
      "conclusion is simply the main point of the argument, the primary thing that the\n",
      "author is trying to convince you of.\n",
      "Let’s look at a simple argument.\n",
      "Bobby needs to watch the Red Sox game. His TV is broken.\n",
      "Therefore, he should buy a new TV.\n",
      "What is the conclusion of the above argument? Pretty clearly, the ultimate point\n",
      "the author is trying to make is that Bobby should buy a new television. In\n",
      "addition to the general thrust of the argument, the tip-off we have here is the\n",
      "word “therefore.” Certain words tend to indicate that the conclusion is about to\n",
      "follow. Among them are therefore, thus, so, clearly, hence, consequently, and in\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "The first thing you should always do is identify the conclusion of the argument.\n",
      "Premises\n",
      "Think of premises as the reasons that the author gives to make you believe the\n",
      "conclusion. An argument can’t simply assert something without backing it up.\n",
      "That wouldn’t be an argument at all. The author of an argument needs to provide\n",
      "evidence to support the conclusion. Those pieces of evidence are the premises.\n",
      "Let’s take another look at our sample argument.\n",
      "Bobby needs to watch the Red Sox game. His TV is broken.\n",
      "Therefore, he should buy a new TV.\n",
      "We know that the conclusion is that Bobby should buy a new television. What\n",
      "are the premises of this argument? What evidence did the author provide to\n",
      "support the conclusion? This time it’s pretty clear that the premises are the other\n",
      "two sentences in the argument: Bobby needs to watch the Red Sox game; his TV\n",
      "is broken.\n",
      "After identifying the conclusion, you should always identify the premises of an\n",
      "argument.\n",
      "The “Why?” Test\n",
      "There’s a simple way to determine if you’ve correctly identified the conclusion\n",
      "and premises of an argument. It’s called the “Why?” test, and this is how it\n",
      "works. After you have identified what you believe to be the conclusion of the\n",
      "argument, ask yourself, “Why should I believe this is true?” The premises should\n",
      "answer that question. For example, ask, “Why should I believe that Bobby\n",
      "should buy a new TV?” The answer here is clearly, “Because he needs to watch\n",
      "the Red Sox, and his TV is busted.” That means we’ve correctly identified the\n",
      "conclusion and premises. What if we’d misidentified them?\n",
      "Let’s say we had thought that the conclusion was the first sentence. When we\n",
      "ask, “Why should I believe that Bobby needs to watch the Red Sox?” there’s\n",
      "nothing to point to. Nothing in the argument provides any support for that\n",
      "statement. The argument just says so. We just have to accept it as given.\n",
      "So the “Why?” test helps us to make sure we’ve correctly broken down the\n",
      "argument into its basic pieces.\n",
      "Assumptions\n",
      "So far, we’ve seen how to find conclusions and premises. Assumptions are the\n",
      "third part of arguments. Assumptions are similar to premises in that they also\n",
      "provide reasons to support the conclusion. But they have a key difference. While\n",
      "the premises are explicitly stated in the argument, the assumptions are by\n",
      "definition unstated.\n",
      "Assumptions are things that must be true in order for the conclusion to make\n",
      "sense, but that the author left out of the argument. Instead of establishing the\n",
      "truth of those facts, the author simply assumed that they were true. Let’s go back\n",
      "one more time to our sample argument.\n",
      "Bobby needs to watch the Red Sox game. His TV is broken.\n",
      "Therefore, he should buy a new TV.\n",
      "What must the author be assuming in order for the argument to make sense?\n",
      "What else must be true for the conclusion to follow properly from the premises?\n",
      "Well, for one, we have to assume that Bobby can’t get his TV fixed, or can’t get\n",
      "it fixed soon enough to watch the game. If he could get it fixed, then he wouldn’t\n",
      "have to buy a new one.\n",
      "Second, we have to assume that there’s no other way Bobby can watch the Red\n",
      "Sox game. For example, he can’t go over to his friend Johnny’s house and watch\n",
      "the game there. Or he can’t go to Fenway Park and see the game live. If he could\n",
      "do either of these things, he wouldn’t have to buy a new TV.\n",
      "So, let’s summarize the breakdown of this argument:\n",
      "Conclusion: Bobby should buy a new TV.\n",
      "Premises: He needs to watch the Red Sox Game. His TV\n",
      "is broken.\n",
      "Assumptions: He can’t get his TV fixed. He can’t watch the\n",
      "game some other way.\n",
      "Why Assumptions Are So Important\n",
      "It’s important to understand that assumptions are necessary for an argument to\n",
      "work. If the assumptions aren’t true, the argument falls apart. In the argument\n",
      "above, if Bobby can fix his TV, or watch the game another way, then he doesn’t\n",
      "have to buy a new TV. The conclusion is effectively destroyed. This is the key\n",
      "because, as we said, your task on the Argument essay is to weaken the argument.\n",
      "You do that by identifying the assumptions of the argument and attacking them.\n",
      "Here are a few more tips to help you spot assumptions:\n",
      "• Focus on the gap in the argument. There is always a gap between the\n",
      "premises of an argument and the conclusion, some unjustified leap of logic\n",
      "that needs to be filled by the assumptions. If you look for the gap in the\n",
      "reasoning, and think about what information will bridge that gap, it will be\n",
      "easier to find the assumptions.\n",
      "• Look for new stuff in the conclusion. If the conclusion talks about things\n",
      "that weren’t mentioned at all in the premises, then the author must have\n",
      "simply assumed there was a connection.\n",
      "• Think about weaknesses in the argument. What are the possible flaws? An\n",
      "argument is always weakest at its unstated parts. Pretend you’re a lawyer in a\n",
      "courtroom and your job is to raise doubt in the minds of the members of the\n",
      "jury about the truth of the argument’s conclusion. What could you say? What\n",
      "counterexamples and alternative possibilities could you suggest?\n",

      "1. The conclusion is that putting computers into Wilmington classrooms\n",
      "will raise students’ test scores. Why should we believe that? Because\n",
      "Dover has higher scores and there are computers in all of its\n",
      "classrooms. Those are the premises. Lastly, what are the assumptions?\n",
      "First, that the computers are the actual explanation for the higher test\n",
      "scores in Dover, rather than something else such as better teachers or\n",
      "access to Princeton Review books. Second, even if the computers are\n",
      "the cause of the higher test scores, you have to assume that the two\n",
      "towns are similar enough so that what works in one town will work in\n",

      "computers and so computers won’t help them.\n",
      "2. The conclusion is that Tony’s Macaroni is the best-tasting brand of\n",
      "mac and cheese in town. The evidence for this conclusion (in other\n",
      "words, the premises) is that it’s the best-selling brand at FreshStar\n",
      "supermarket. What are the big assumptions here? One is that the sales\n",
      "at FreshStar are representative of the sales at all other supermarkets in\n",
      "town. Maybe Tony’s Macaroni sells very poorly at other stores. (If\n",
      "you were thinking that FreshStar is the only supermarket in town, you\n",
      "were just assuming that. The argument never says it.) The second big\n",
      "assumption is that best sales = best taste. In other words, the argument\n",
      "assumes that Tony’s Macaroni sells well because it tastes better than\n",
      "other brands. But that’s not necessarily true. Maybe it’s just cheaper.\n",
      "3. The conclusion is that any product using the food additive will be\n",
      "dangerous for humans. The premise is that it caused cancer in lab rats.\n",
      "The assumptions? Well, for one, they’re assuming that humans are\n",

      "Sentence Equivalence\n",
      "THE GOAL: FILL IN THE BLANK\n",
      "Sentence Equivalence questions are very similar to Text Completion questions,\n",
      "and we will approach them in a manner similar to the way we did one-blank\n",
      "Text Completion questions. Sentence Equivalence questions will give you a\n",
      "sentence with one blank, and you need to find the two words that could fill in the\n",
      "blank. Inserting either word into the blank will result in equivalent sentences.\n",
      "Here’s an example:\n",
      "Although he had inherited a large fortune, his\n",
      "_______ spending quickly drained his family’s\n",
      "coffers, leaving him in poverty.\n",
      "timorous extravagant pernicious\n",
      "provident frugal profligate\n",
      "The steps for solving a Sentence Equivalence question are as follows:\n",
      "1. Write down A B C D E F vertically on your scratch paper.\n",
      "2. Read the sentence. For now, do not read the answers.\n",
      "3. Locate clues and transitions in the sentence. Use these to figure out your\n",
      "own word or phrase to fill in the blank. Write down this word or phrase on\n",

      "Sentence Equivalence questions are basically a way to test your vocabulary.\n",
      "Because of this, make sure you’re studying GRE vocabulary words every day.\n",

      "Clues and Transitions\n",

      "Remember that clues tell us what must go in the blank. The clues are generally\n",
      "the most descriptive words or phrases in the sentence, and can be used to prove\n",
      "what the meaning of the blank has to be. There will always be a clue in the\n",
      "sentence. A transition tells us whether the blank goes in the same or opposite\n",
      "direction as the clue. (For more about clues and transitions, see Chapter 3: Text\n",
      "Completions.)\n",
      "Quick Quiz #1\n",

      "Look at the work you did on question 14. Although you didn’t know what the\n",
      "words from (C) or (D) meant, they don’t matter. Why? You’ve got two words\n",
      "that you know work. In that case, pick (A) and (E) and move on.\n",
      "How about question 15? Now we’ve got 3 checks, which is a problem because\n",
      "we should only have 2 words. No problem. If that happens, it just means your\n",
      "word or phrase was a little too vague. See if you can change your word or phrase\n",
      "to match the clue more closely, and try each remaining answer choice again.\n",
      "Look to eliminate any word whose meaning can not be proven by the\n",
      "information in the sentence.\n",
      "Question 16 is the type of question that freaks most people out, but it shouldn’t.\n",
      "Whatever question 16 was, you knew you could cross off (A), (B), (D), and (F).\n",
      "Sure, (C) and (E) were apparently tough vocab words you didn’t know, but who\n",
      "cares? They’re the only words left, which means that they must be the answers.\n",
      "Choose (C) and (E) and move on.\n",
      "One Foot in the Door\n",
      "Look at the scratch paper for question 17 above. One of the answers is definitely\n",
      "(A), but it looks like you’ve got three words you didn’t know: (C), (D), and (F).\n",
      "What should you do now?\n",
      "If you don’t know any of those three words at all, then guess one of them and\n",
      "move on. Hey, it’s not great, but you’ve got a much better shot at getting that\n",
      "question right than most people do. If you guess quickly, the time you saved by\n",
      "not staring blankly at those hard vocab words can be used on Reading\n",
      "Comprehension questions.\n",
      "On the other hand, if you sort of recognize the words with question marks, then\n",
      "you’ve got a couple of options.\n",
      "• Positive/Negative\n",
      "Is your original word a positive or negative word? Put a + or – next to your\n",

      "any negative words. If your original word was negative, then cross off any\n",
      "positive words.\n",
      "• Word Association\n",
      "Look at the words you didn’t know. Do you remember where you’ve heard\n",
      "any of them? Can you think of a phrase that uses them? If so, then ask\n",
      "yourself whether that same association could apply to the word you did know\n",
      "(or your original word or phrase). If not, then cross off that answer. But if it\n",
      "sort of fits, then pick it and click Next.\n",
      "Speechless?\n",

      "or any transitions. If that happens, then the first thing you should do is click\n",
      "Mark so you can return to that question later, and then click Next. Once you’ve\n",
      "worked on two or three other Sentence Equivalence questions in that section,\n",
      "you can come back and possibly see something you missed the first time.\n",
      "However, if when you return to that question you still can’t think of a word to go\n",
      "in the blank, then it’s time to match up some answers.\n",
      "Let’s say we couldn’t figure out what the blank had to mean, but the answers\n",
      "were\n",
      "manifest arduous graceful elegant grueling\n",
      "eloquent\n",
      "Look through the answers. Are there any words that match up? They don’t have\n",
      "to be synonyms; they just have to have roughly similar meanings. Choices (C)\n",
      "and (D), graceful and elegant, mean sort of the same thing. Draw a line\n",
      "connecting those two letters on your scratch paper. Now check to see whether\n",
      "there are more matches (there are often two pairs of matching words). Choice\n",
      "(B), arduous, is similar in meaning to choice (E), grueling. Draw a line\n",
      "connecting those two letters as well. The only words we have left are choice (A),\n",
      "manifest, and choice (F), eloquent, which do not even come close to meaning the\n",
      "same thing. Cross off (A) and (F). Now we’ve got two options: Either pick (C)\n",
      "and (D), or pick (B) and (E). Choose one of those pairs of words and move on to\n",
      "the next question.\n",
