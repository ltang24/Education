The second blank requires a phrase that indicates a lack of control over the text, and \"surrendering to\" aligns with the idea of giving up one's own questions to follow the author's logic. Finally, \"glean precisely what you want from it\" fits the last blank, as it emphasizes the ability to extract specific information based on personal inquiries rather than evaluating the book's overall intent.",

For Blank (i), \"expensive\" fits because the argument revolves around wealth and spending. For Blank (ii), \"useless\" aligns with the idea that diamonds do not serve a practical function. For Blank (iii), \"serve no practical purpose\" matches the conclusion that diamonds are purchased either for status or to appear wealthy, rather than for utility.",

In the second blank, \"feedback between\" suggests a reciprocal relationship between mountains and climate, which aligns with the theory being presented. Finally, \"self-perpetuating\" in the third blank describes how mountain glaciers, once formed, continue to influence their environment by increasing surface reflectivity and promoting further ice formation.",
