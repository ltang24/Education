Finally, \"glean precisely what you want from it\" aligns with the reader's ability to extract targeted information, reinforcing the idea of mastery over the text.",

For blank (ii), it emphasizes the necessity of ongoing conservation efforts, making \"obligatory\" the best fit. For blank (iii), the responsibilities cannot be \"jettisoned,\" meaning they cannot be discarded, which fits the overall message that we must act to preserve biodiversity.",

For Blank (i), \"expensive\" fits because the writer emphasizes the high cost of diamonds. For Blank (ii), \"useless\" aligns with the suggestion that these diamonds serve no meaningful function. Finally, for Blank (iii), \"serve no practical purpose\" underscores the idea that diamonds are purchased either for status or perception of wealth, rather than for any functional use.",

The next part of the sentence says Hamilton’s feelings were due to his confrontation with American democracy, which points to \"alienation,\" as it implies a sense of estrangement or disconnection (Blank ii).
