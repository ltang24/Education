However, sociologists have revealed a more complex dynamic.\n\nFor Blank (i), the passage indicates that the relationship between theory and data is not as straightforward as initially thought. The word \"fixed\" in the first sentence suggests a one-sided relationship, which is contradicted by the sociologists' findings. Thus, \"less one-sided\" fits the context.\n\nBlank (ii) refers to the potential for theories and data to be equally disputable or open to interpretation. The word \"may\" indicates a possibility, and \"as\" suggests a comparison. Therefore, \"disputable\" is the most suitable option.\n\nIn Blank (iii), the sentence structure suggests that a theory's prior confirmation can influence the credibility of new findings.

Blank (i) requires a word that indicates this misinterpretation, and \"misconstrued\" fits this context. \n\nBlank (ii) refers to Clark's apparent attitude, which is a facade for his true feelings. \"Acquiescence\" suggests a passive agreement or compliance, which aligns with the idea of veiling his true sentiments. \n\nBlank (iii) reveals Clark's actual feelings towards authority, which are the opposite of what is perceived. \"Detestation\" conveys a strong dislike or hatred, fitting the description of his fervent sentiment towards those in power over him.",
