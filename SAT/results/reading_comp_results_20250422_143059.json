Analyze key information from Text 1\n- The traditional view attributes the K-Pg extinction mainly to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub.\n- Some scientists argue volcanic activity (Deccan Traps) was the main cause, citing the timing and other extinctions linked to volcanic eruptions.\n- The argument implies that the asteroid impact might not be the sole or primary cause, given the timing of volcanic activity.\n\n### 3.

Key information from Text 1:**  \n- Sharif found that life satisfaction plateaus at 2 hours of free time and declines at 5 hours.  \n- The decline is mainly linked to unproductive activities like watching TV or playing games.  \n- Her conclusion suggests that unproductiveness in free time reduces life satisfaction.\n\n**3. Key information from Text 2:**  \n- Maddux warns against suggesting a universal ideal amount of free time.  \n- He emphasizes that people's needs for free time and productivity are individual.  \n- There\u2019s no objective way to define what counts as productivity; it varies by person.\n\n---\n\n**4.

Analyze key information from Text 1\n- Fossils are difficult to date accurately due to geological issues.\n- Soil layers are mixed, impeding stratigraphic dating.\n- Animal bones nearby may have been moved by flooding, making their dating unreliable.\n- The main concern: traditional dating methods (soil layers, bones) are unreliable in this context.\n\n### 3.
