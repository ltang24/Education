Analyze Key Information from Text 2\n- Long-period comets and asteroids can both contain carbonaceous chondrites.\n- Some asteroids are rich in iridium, whereas long-period comets are not.\n- Natalia Artemieva argues that the presence of iridium in the Chicxulub crater and geological layers is a better indicator that an asteroid was the impactor.\n\n#### 4.
