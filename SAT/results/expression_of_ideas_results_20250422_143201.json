They worry that participants might act differently in front of cameras and that viewers would not engage with the full context of the arguments, leading to misunderstandings.\n\n2. **Identify the relationship between the sentences before and after the blank**: The first part of the passage indicates the justices' concerns about the quality of discourse being lowered due to performance for the cameras. The sentence after the blank elaborates on another specific worry: that viewers would only see short clips, which could lead to misinterpretation. This suggests a continuation of the justices' concerns.\n\n3. **Consider each transition option and how it affects the flow and logic of the passage**:\n   - **A: However,** - This implies a contrast or contradiction, which does not fit since the secon..."
