The passage then introduces Isabel Sanmart\u00edn, who does not align with either group.\n\n2. **Identify the relationship between the sentences before and after the blank**: The first part of the passage presents two opposing views regarding species distribution. The second part introduces Isabel Sanmart\u00edn, indicating that she does not belong to either camp. The blank needs a transition that reflects this contrast or distinction.\n\n3. **Consider each transition option and how it affects the flow and logic of the passage**:\n   - **A: Furthermore** - This suggests an addition to the previous statement, which does not fit since Sanmart\u00edn is not adding to the debate but rather distancing herself from it.\n..."
