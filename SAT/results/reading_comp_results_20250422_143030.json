The sentence mentions that despite problems, the spacecraft was able to do something related to a sample to return to Earth.\n\n2. **Analyze the context in which the word or phrase is used**  \nThe context is about a spacecraft mission to an asteroid, where the spacecraft's goal was to obtain a sample from the asteroid's surface and bring it back to Earth. The text notes that there were unforeseen problems due to boulders, but the spacecraft succeeded in some action involving the sample.\n\n3. **Consider the meaning and nuance of each option**  \n- **A: attached** \u2014 This means to fasten or join something to another object.
