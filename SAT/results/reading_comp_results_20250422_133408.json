The blank needs a word or phrase that describes the relationship between nuisance costs and donation size.\n\n2. **Analyze the context in which the word or phrase is used**: The sentence indicates that nuisance costs are variable and that charities compensating for these costs will likely prefer to attract a few large donors rather than many small ones. This suggests that there is a specific relationship between nuisance costs and the size of donations.\n\n3. **Consider the meaning and nuance of each option**:\n   - **A: supplemental to**: This suggests that nuisance costs add to the donation size, which doesn't fit the context because the sentence implies that nuisance costs reduce the effectiveness of donations.\n   - **B: predictive of**: This implies that nuisance costs can pre..."

This suggests that the missing word should relate to a quality that is positive and harmonious.\n\n3. **Consider the meaning and nuance of each option**:\n   - A: **scholarly** - This implies an academic or intellectual quality, which does not align with the musical and pleasant nature described in the text.\n   - B: **melodic** - This directly relates to music and suggests a harmonious, tuneful quality, which fits well with the description of the poetry's pleasant musical quality.\n   - C: **jarring** - This suggests something harsh or discordant, which is the opposite of the pleasant qu..."

Analyze the context in which the word or phrase is used**\n\nThe sentence describes a creative relationship between Woolf and Bell, highlighting that Bell, a painter, worked closely with Woolf on cover art. This suggests a positive and collaborative interaction rather than a negative or conflictual one.\n\n  \n\n**3.
