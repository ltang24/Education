In a right triangle, the sine of an acute angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In the triangle shown, the length of the side opposite the angle with measure x° is 16 units and the length of the hypotenuse is 23 units. Therefore, the value of sin(x°) is 16/23. Note that 16/23, 0.6956, 0.6957, 0.695, and 0.696 are acceptable correct forms."

With a perimeter of 20 cm and five equal sides (3 sides of triangles + 2 bases), each side is 4 cm. Splitting a triangle gives a 30°-60°-90° triangle with sides 2 cm, 2√3 cm, and 4 cm. Area of one triangle: (1/2)(4)(2√3) = 4√3 cm². Two triangles are shaded: 2×(4√3) = 8√3 cm². Alternatively, trapezoid area is (1/2)(b₁+b₂)h = 12√3/2 = 6√3, two-thirds of it is 8√3 cm²."
